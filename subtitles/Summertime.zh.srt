00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:03,290
治愈吸血鬼的解药
The cure to vampirism.

9
00:00:03,290 --> 00:00:04,690
你要服下解药  埃琳娜
You're gonna take the cure, Elena.

10
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:05,610
我要和你一起服下
And I'm gonna take it with you.

11
00:00:05,620 --> 00:00:06,810
但我不能让你这么做
but I can't let you do this,

12
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:08,780
你得先让你生命中的每个人
before you've let everyone in your life

13
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:10,180
劝你别这么做
try to talk you out of it.

14
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:11,910
-我怀孕了  -嫁给我
- I'm pregnant. - Marry me.

15
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:12,630
我愿意
Yes.

16
00:00:12,630 --> 00:00:14,080
如果我的人性恢复时
If my life is gonna fall apart

17
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:15,930
我的人生要全面崩溃
when my humanity starts flooding back,

18
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:16,960
那么你也得一样
then so is yours.

19
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:18,590
我试图杀你
I tried to kill you,

20
00:00:18,590 --> 00:00:20,070
然后我逼你关闭人性
and then I made you turn it off,.

21
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:22,370
我毁了一切
I ruined everything.

22
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:24,860
20世纪前  莉莉和一群被双子巫师团
Before the 1900s, Lily fell in with a group of witches

23
00:00:24,860 --> 00:00:26,750
驱逐的巫师走到了一起
that were cast out of the Gemini Coven.

24
00:00:26,750 --> 00:00:28,130
异教徒很残忍
Heretics are ruthless,

25
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:29,690
既是吸血鬼  又拥有巫师法力
vampires with witch power.

26
00:00:29,690 --> 00:00:31,470
绝不能让他们逃出来
They can never be allowed to escape.

27
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:33,730
我们该离开这个鬼地方了
It's time we get the hell out of this place.

28
00:00:34,080 --> 00:00:35,990
你昨晚大开杀戒了
You went off the deep end last night.

29
00:00:38,470 --> 00:00:39,970
我现在简直一团糟
I'm a mess.

30
00:00:43,030 --> 00:00:45,610
你根本不知道崩溃是什么感觉
You have no idea what devastation feels like,

31
00:00:45,610 --> 00:00:46,990
但你会知道的
but you will.

32
00:01:05,380 --> 00:01:06,630
埃琳娜
Elena?

33
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:36,150
又见面了  邦妮
Hello again, Bonnie.

34
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:39,270
莉莉  斯特凡不是把你锁在地下室了吗
Lily. I thought Stefan locked you in the cellar.

35
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:41,580
是啊  但逃狱是很容易的
He did, but prisons are easily escaped.

36
00:01:41,580 --> 00:01:42,900
这你是最清楚的
You of all people should know that.

37
00:01:42,900 --> 00:01:44,050
你想怎么样
What do you want?

38
00:01:44,050 --> 00:01:46,590
我非得不断重复吗
Must I constantly repeat myself?

39
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:48,090
如果你到现在还不知道我想要什么
If you don't know what I want by now--

40
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:51,350
你要你可怕的吸血鬼巫师家族回到身边
You want your creepy witch vampire family back.

41
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:54,120
那我也重复一遍  休想
Well, at the risk of repeating myself, there's no way.

42
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:55,560
是吗  你们巫师
Isn't there? What's that term

43
00:01:55,560 --> 00:01:58,980
最喜欢的那个词怎么说的来着  "漏洞"
you witches are so fond of? "Loophole"?

44
00:01:59,560 --> 00:02:01,520
就算真有漏洞
Even if there is a loophole,

45
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:02,690
我也不会帮你找到
I won't help you find it.

46
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:04,900
你已经表明立场了
Oh, you've made your position quite clear.

47
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:06,610
显然  我并未好好表明我的立场
Apparently, I failed to do the same,

48
00:02:06,610 --> 00:02:09,120
因为你似乎是以为我是来找你帮忙的
because you seem to think that I'm here for your help.

49
00:02:09,550 --> 00:02:10,860
不是的
I'm not.

50
00:02:12,500 --> 00:02:14,110
[咒语]
Phesmatos incendia.

51
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,580
好甜蜜的话语  邦妮
Those are lovely words, Bonnie.

52
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:19,540
再说一个  死吧
Here's another one--die.

53
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:31,850
你真不擅长跑啊
You are not good at running.

54
00:02:33,330 --> 00:02:34,430
[咒语]
Motus.

55
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:37,150
没有魔法吗  我的错
No magic? Oh, that's my fault.

56
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:38,230
我刚刚抱着你睡来着
I was spooning you earlier.

57
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:39,810
可能在睡梦中把你吸干了
I think I might've sleep-siphoned you.

58
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:41,980
继续努力啊  挺可爱的
Oh, but keep trying. It's adorable,

59
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:43,300
像是癫痫了一样
like you're having a little seizure.

60
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:44,350
-你怎么...  -你真以为
- How are you-- - Did you think

61
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:45,960
你可以这么坑人
you could keep screwing people over

62
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,750
而不会有后果吗
and there wouldn't be any consequences?

63
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:48,780
好了
Now...

64
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:51,480
我们刚刚说到哪了
Where were we?

65
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:54,960
起床了  没时间睡懒觉了
Up, up, up. Come on. No time to sleep in.

66
00:02:54,960 --> 00:02:55,840
我们得去接乔
We have to get Jo.

67
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:57,580
-接乔  -是啊
- Get Jo? - Yeah.

68
00:02:57,680 --> 00:02:58,640
出什么事了吗
Is everything ok?

69
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,980
希望没有  再过10小时
I hope so, considering she's walking down the aisle

70
00:03:00,980 --> 00:03:02,570
她就要嫁人了
in T-minus 10 hours.

71
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:03,640
走吧
Come on.

72
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:05,080
婚礼钟声要敲响了
Wedding bells await.

73
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:15,180
该死
Crap.

74
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:17,540
他们不在这儿
They're not here.

75
00:03:17,800 --> 00:03:18,580
怎么了
What's wrong?

76
00:03:18,580 --> 00:03:21,340
我的鞋  我美丽  贵得离谱
My shoes. My gorgeous, ridiculously expensive,

77
00:03:21,370 --> 00:03:23,410
只穿一次就再也不碰的鞋子  不见了
wear them once and then never again shoes. They are missing.

78
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:25,060
要我施个定位咒找找吗
Do you want me to do a locator spell on them?

79
00:03:25,060 --> 00:03:25,780
找我的鞋吗
On my shoes?

80
00:03:26,300 --> 00:03:28,180
-这能做到吗  -不知道啊
- Is that possible? - I don't know, actually.

81
00:03:28,180 --> 00:03:31,890
等等的  我看看怎么操作这破玩意
Just hang on. I got to figure out how to work this stupid thing.

82
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:33,180
好啊  弄坏吧
Oh, good. Break it

83
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:34,440
如果我裙子皱巴巴的
Because my wrinkled dress will surely

84
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:36,550
大家一定就不会注意到我没穿鞋了
distract everyone from my bare feet.

85
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:39,080
被这样  别现在就慌张啊
Come on. Don't waste all your panic now.

86
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,090
距离婚礼还有8小时呢
You still have 8 hours until the ceremony.

87
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:42,700
来杯不含酒精的含羞草吧
Non-alcoholic mimosa?

88
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:44,930
一  不含酒精的话  那就剩橙汁了
One, a non-alcoholic mimosa is just orange juice,

89
00:03:44,930 --> 00:03:46,100
二  我不能喝东西
and two, I can't drink.

90
00:03:46,100 --> 00:03:47,630
该有人喝酒  你喝吧
Somebody should drink. You should drink.

91
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:49,390
我回头会喝的
I will drink, eventually,

92
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:50,930
但我的酒量恢复人类状态了
But I have human tolerance now,

93
00:03:50,930 --> 00:03:53,420
虽然省钱  但不那么好玩了
which is cheaper but a lot less fun.

94
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:54,510
干杯
Cheers.

95
00:03:55,800 --> 00:03:56,540
别别
No, no, no, no.

96
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:00,290
放松
Relax.

97
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:02,010
乔的手机
Jo's phone.

98
00:04:04,900 --> 00:04:05,920
好吧
Uh, ok.

99
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,880
这可不是没事的"好吧"
That's not an "ok" ok.

100
00:04:07,900 --> 00:04:10,080
这是"有麻烦了"的"好吧"
That's a "there's a problem" ok.

101
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:12,160
我们再打给你  好的  再见
Yeah, we'll call you back. Ok, bye.

102
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,340
丹妮尔得了流感
Danielle's got the flu.

103
00:04:15,930 --> 00:04:18,810
你好像刚刚说丹妮尔得了流感
It sounded like you just said Danielle has the flu,

104
00:04:18,810 --> 00:04:22,240
这是不可能的  因为丹妮尔是我的婚礼协调人
which is impossible because Danielle is my wedding coordinator.

105
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,500
是啊
Yeah.

106
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:25,700
她病得多重  能继续工作吗
Well, how sick is she? Can she still work?

107
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:28,970
那要看你想在婚礼上看到多少呕吐物了
It depends on how much vomit you want to have at the wedding.

108
00:04:30,380 --> 00:04:32,840
老实说  我觉得这或许也是好事
To be honest, I think maybe this is a good thing,

109
00:04:32,980 --> 00:04:34,770
因为不管丹妮尔多厉害
Because no matter how good Danielle was,

110
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:36,750
都绝对比不过我
I am pretty sure I'm better.

111
00:04:38,250 --> 00:04:39,510
卡罗琳
Caroline.

112
00:04:39,620 --> 00:04:40,880
我好想你
I missed you.

113
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:42,580
我也想我了
I missed me, too.

114
00:04:43,350 --> 00:04:45,680
谢谢你把我拉回来
Thank you for getting me back.

115
00:04:52,660 --> 00:04:54,220
好了  我们有好多事要做
Ok. Now, we got a lot to do

116
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:55,530
却没多少时间
and not a lot of time to do it.

117
00:04:55,530 --> 00:04:56,820
埃琳娜  喝一杯吧
Elena, just have a drink.

118
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:58,020
你不会昏过去的
You're not going to pass out.

119
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:01,610
邦妮  开关在左后方
Bonnie, the switch is on the left-hand side on the back.

120
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:04,550
乔  你的鞋就在沙发下面
And Jo, I can see your shoes under the couch.

121
00:05:05,590 --> 00:05:07,440
好了  谁负责男生们
Ok, now, who's dealing with the boys?

122
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:09,400
西装在这里
Ok, we got suits.

123
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:11,910
戒指在这里
I got the rings.

124
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:13,570
婚誓在这里
And the vows.

125
00:05:13,670 --> 00:05:16,710
那现在做什么
So...what do we do now?

126
00:05:17,610 --> 00:05:18,950
敬阿拉里克·萨尔茨曼
To Alaric Saltzman,

127
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:20,630
今天以后  他这辈子
who after today, will have sex with

128
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:22,950
就只能跟一个女人做爱了
only one woman for the rest of his life.

129
00:05:22,950 --> 00:05:23,750
真的  就一个
Seriously, just one.

130
00:05:23,750 --> 00:05:24,900
今后连想都不能想了
You can't even look after this.

131
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:26,220
虽说神秘学研究教授
Not that chicks are throwing themselves

132
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:28,130
本来也不是很吸引女人  不过...
at an occult studies professor, but--

133
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:30,660
是啊  你还是趁她没改主意赶紧娶回家吧
Yeah, actually, you should probably lock this down while you can.

134
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:32,910
嗯  还记得你们不和的时光是多么美好吗
Yeah, you remember how great it was when you two were fighting?

135
00:05:32,910 --> 00:05:34,780
抱歉  今晚满月
Sorry. Full moon tonight.

136
00:05:34,780 --> 00:05:35,790
我特别想犯浑
Feeling extra dickish.

137
00:05:35,790 --> 00:05:37,340
你又有什么借口
And what's your excuse?

138
00:05:39,170 --> 00:05:40,360
怎么了
What? What is it?

139
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:43,020
婚礼杂务
Wedding day chores.

140
00:05:43,020 --> 00:05:44,430
卡罗琳分配的
Courtesy of Caroline.

141
00:05:44,430 --> 00:05:47,410
报应  天道自有轮回啊
Karma. Sweet, sweet karma.

142
00:05:50,470 --> 00:05:52,830
男生们已经搞定了
Ok, the boys are officially taken care of.

143
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,370
新娘和伴娘都打扮好了
Bride and maid of honor are in hair and makeup.

144
00:05:54,370 --> 00:05:56,790
我这就去场地收拾好他们搞砸的东西
I'm gonna head to the venue and fix whatever they're screwing up.

145
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:58,050
埃琳娜  捲发钳
Elena, the curling iron.

146
00:05:58,050 --> 00:05:59,420
嗯  看到啦  卡罗
Yes, is, I see it, Care.

147
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:01,600
-好  -我是变成了人  但我不瞎
- Ok. - I'm human now, not blind.

148
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:02,460
也不是玻璃人
And I'm not fragile, either.

149
00:06:02,460 --> 00:06:04,230
你不用对我那么小心翼翼的[踩蛋壳]
You don't have to walk on eggshells around me.

150
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:05,720
我需要啊
Uh, I do, actually,

151
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:07,030
因为如果你踩到了蛋壳
because if you walked on them,

152
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:09,750
就可能被割伤  可能会感染  可能会死
they could cut you, you'd get infected, and probably die.

153
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:11,220
知道吗
You know what?

154
00:06:11,230 --> 00:06:12,530
鉴于我的运气
Given my luck,

155
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:14,690
这似乎的确有可能
that actually seems possible.

156
00:06:16,150 --> 00:06:19,630
做活人的感觉如何
So what's it like now in the world of the living?

157
00:06:19,630 --> 00:06:21,880
不一样了  我速度慢了
It's different. I'm slower.

158
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,200
过马路之前得左顾右盼了
I have to look both ways before crossing the street.

159
00:06:24,360 --> 00:06:25,430
但这样不错  不用...
But it's nice to not--

160
00:06:25,430 --> 00:06:27,250
做我那样的恶魔
Be a monster like me

161
00:06:27,330 --> 00:06:29,420
关闭了人性  还杀人
who turns off their humanity and commits murder

162
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:31,450
而不是像个普通人那样面对丧亲之痛
instead of dealing with grief like a normal person?

163
00:06:31,450 --> 00:06:34,670
我是想说不用成天戴日光戒指了
I was gonna say not to have to wear a daylight ring all the time.

164
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:38,460
对不起  埃琳娜
Look, I'm so sorry, Elena,

165
00:06:38,480 --> 00:06:40,140
我之前说你不是人类
I was trying to hurt you

166
00:06:40,140 --> 00:06:42,760
所以跟达蒙在一起也找不到真幸福
when I said that you would never truly be happy with Damon

167
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:44,000
只是想伤害你
because you weren't human.

168
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:44,880
而现在你变回了人类
And now you are, 

169
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:47,910
我希望这不是因为我让你觉得
and I just hope that it's not because I made you think that

170
00:06:47,910 --> 00:06:50,140
你的永生会很痛苦
you would be miserable for eternity.

171
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:54,420
卡罗  我自从成为了吸血鬼就一直想变回人类
Care. I've wanted to be human from the day I became a vampire.

172
00:06:54,640 --> 00:06:58,150
而且  你是最不用跟我道歉了
Besides, I'm the last person that you need to apologize to.

173
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:02,500
谢谢  我想从比较轻松的那个开始
Thanks. I kind of wanted to start with an easy one.

174
00:07:02,530 --> 00:07:04,240
可怕的赎罪之旅啊
The dreaded amends tour.

175
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:07,750
如果你看到了斯特凡  我正在躲他
If you see Stefan, by the way, I am avoiding.

176
00:07:07,820 --> 00:07:09,890
我得先恢复我的生活
I just need to get my life in order first.

177
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:11,970
从我的朋友开始
Starting with my friends.

178
00:07:11,970 --> 00:07:13,630
斯特凡不算朋友吗
Stefan's not a friend?

179
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,670
斯特凡  比较复杂
Stefan's...complicated.

180
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,930
我想挨个人恢复  最后到他
I just figured I'd work my way up to that one.

181
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:20,110
你没事
Well, you're in the clear.

182
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:22,210
他今天得应付达蒙
He's got his hands full with Damon today.

183
00:07:22,220 --> 00:07:23,270
达蒙怎么了
What's wrong with Damon?

184
00:07:23,270 --> 00:07:26,340
没什么  他就是说要跟我一起服用解药
Not much. He just said he would take the cure with me.

185
00:07:28,320 --> 00:07:29,870
达蒙·塞尔瓦托吗
Damon Salvatore?

186
00:07:29,870 --> 00:07:31,890
变成人吗
Human? I--

187
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:33,870
我简直无法想象
I can't even picture it.

188
00:07:33,870 --> 00:07:37,660
嗯  我觉得他也无法想象
Yeah. Something tells me neither can he.

189
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:41,120
好啊  我做你的伴郎  里克
"Sure, I'll be your best man, Ric,

190
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:42,930
不过我要先跟最坏的人待在一起
but first, hang out with the worst men

191
00:07:42,930 --> 00:07:44,510
好在你婚礼这天
so that my brother can kidnap me

192
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:45,730
被我弟弟绑架
on the day of your wedding."

193
00:07:45,730 --> 00:07:47,670
你不是反正也讨厌婚礼的吗
Hey, don't you hate weddings anyway?

194
00:07:47,680 --> 00:07:50,580
我更讨厌斯特凡操纵我的想法
I hate little Stefan mind games even more.

195
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:55,820
你如果想告诉我  我们究竟要去哪  请便
So any time you want to clue me in as to where the hell we're going.

196
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:58,370
得了  这是你做吸血鬼的最后几天了
Oh, come on. It's your last few days as a vampire.

197
00:07:58,530 --> 00:07:59,640
我想跟哥哥好好聚聚
You can't blame me for wanting to spend

198
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,430
这不能怪我吧
some quality time with my brother.

199
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:03,740
看啊  我们到了
Ah, look. Here we are.

200
00:08:12,050 --> 00:08:13,950
罗杰斯先生知道我们要来吗
Is Mr. Rogers expecting us?

201
00:08:14,580 --> 00:08:16,610
你知道罗杰斯先生已经死了吧
You know Mr. Rogers is dead, right?

202
00:08:16,610 --> 00:08:18,240
是啊  你如果不赶紧说明用意
Yeah, we're gonna be joining him in make-believe

203
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,050
我们也要无聊死了
if you don't get to the damn point.

204
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:23,030
我曾经在这栋房子里
So this is a house I lived in

205
00:08:23,030 --> 00:08:26,080
重新开始过一段生活
during one of my many attempts to start over.

206
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,770
欢迎来到你的郊区噩梦
Welcome to your suburban nightmare.

207
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:30,560
你以为我没想好吗
You don't think I've thought this through?

208
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:32,740
我觉得你考虑的是跟埃琳娜共度一生
Well, I think you've thought about a life with Elena.

209
00:08:32,740 --> 00:08:34,530
但你可能没想过邻居
I don't think you've thought about neighbors

210
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:36,770
按揭
or a mortgage or--

211
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:41,200
孩子
or kids.

212
00:08:41,300 --> 00:08:42,140
我也说不好
I don't know.

213
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:43,530
或许不适合你呢
Might not be your thing.

214
00:08:52,750 --> 00:08:55,190
放松  放松
Relax. Relax.

215
00:08:55,190 --> 00:08:56,580
我不是来捣乱的
I'm not here to cause mischief.

216
00:08:56,580 --> 00:08:58,700
每个捣乱的人都这么说
Said everyone who ever causes mischief.

217
00:08:58,710 --> 00:09:00,130
我答应莉莉会来看她的
I told Lily I'd visit.

218
00:09:00,130 --> 00:09:02,030
你这是恋母情结吗
Is this like some oedipus thing?

219
00:09:02,030 --> 00:09:03,990
告诉你  无所谓了
All right. You know what? Doesn't matter.

220
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,290
抱歉  小女巫
Excuse me, little witch.

221
00:09:06,290 --> 00:09:08,220
如果你觉得  我会让你
If you think I'm gonna let you--

222
00:09:08,220 --> 00:09:10,340
这个专门搞破坏的人进来见另一个同类
a ruiner--in here to see another ruiner

223
00:09:10,340 --> 00:09:11,260
而且还是在乔婚礼这天
on the day of Jo's wedding,

224
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:12,600
你就错了
you got another thing coming.

225
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:14,940
她孤单  饥饿
She's lonely and hungry.

226
00:09:14,940 --> 00:09:15,690
她不能吸血
And she can't eat that.

227
00:09:15,700 --> 00:09:17,410
我不是要喂她血
I'm not trying to feed her.

228
00:09:17,410 --> 00:09:18,900
我只是想让她保持清醒
I'm trying to keep her sane.

229
00:09:19,780 --> 00:09:23,720
那里面全是她熟悉的时代的歌曲
That is filled with loads of songs from the last era she knew.

230
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,410
我觉得能给她点慰藉
I thought it might bring her comfort.

231
00:09:25,840 --> 00:09:27,540
如果你不是完全铁石心肠
If you're not a complete monster,

232
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:29,330
相信你一定会转交的
I trust you'll pass it on.

233
00:09:36,680 --> 00:09:38,270
我想要回我的家人
I want my family back.

234
00:09:39,020 --> 00:09:40,630
我只想要这个
That's all I've ever wanted,

235
00:09:40,660 --> 00:09:43,770
让我家人回到我身边  这才是他们的归宿
to have my family back with me where they belong.

236
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,670
怎么回事
What?

237
00:10:10,370 --> 00:10:11,860
她在念念叨叨说她的家人
She was rambling on about her family,

238
00:10:11,860 --> 00:10:12,880
我就靠过去
and then I got close to her,

239
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:15,450
她就像个动物一样袭击了我
and she attacked me like an animal.

240
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:18,810
看来她已经达到了风干的彻底疯狂阶段
Sounds like she's reached the full-blown crazy stage of drying out.

241
00:10:18,810 --> 00:10:20,870
你是说这完全是因为她在风干吗
You're saying this is all because she's drying out?

242
00:10:20,870 --> 00:10:22,940
我很难解释那感觉多糟糕
It's hard for me to explain how awful it is,

243
00:10:22,950 --> 00:10:25,720
但是的  你的头脑会开始欺骗你
but, yeah, your mind starts playing tricks on you.

244
00:10:25,720 --> 00:10:28,460
你会看到幻象
You start seeing things and people.

245
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:30,250
过了疯狂的阶段呢
What happens when the crazy stage is over?

246
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:31,680
斯特凡说他有计划
Well, Stefan said that he has a plan,

247
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:33,170
帮她重回正轨
you know, to get her back on track.

248
00:10:33,170 --> 00:10:35,040
那要放她出来吗
Does that plan involve letting her out?

249
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:37,270
因为他如果以为她会放弃自己的家庭
Because if he thinks she's giving up on her family--

250
00:10:37,270 --> 00:10:38,490
她必须放弃
She has to.

251
00:10:38,490 --> 00:10:40,320
邦妮  你已经毁掉了支配器
Bonnie, you already destroyed the ascendant.

252
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:41,890
如果有漏洞呢
What if there's a loophole?

253
00:10:44,450 --> 00:10:45,260
我好怕
I'm dreading it,

254
00:10:45,260 --> 00:10:47,620
但我觉得我该去穿婚纱了
but I guess I should think about putting the dress on.

255
00:10:49,420 --> 00:10:51,070
出事了
Something's wrong.

256
00:10:51,070 --> 00:10:52,000
不是婚纱吧
it's not the dress, is it?

257
00:10:52,010 --> 00:10:52,930
告诉我不是婚纱
Tell me it's not the dress.

258
00:10:52,930 --> 00:10:54,280
我们刚刚在讨论
We were just discussing the fact

259
00:10:54,280 --> 00:10:56,510
地下室里锁着一个正在风干的吸血鬼
that there's a desiccating vampire locked in a cell

260
00:10:56,510 --> 00:10:58,790
我们就在不到50英尺的地方准备婚礼
less than 50 feet from where we're getting ready.

261
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:00,310
她弄坏婚纱了吗
Did she do something to the dress?

262
00:11:00,310 --> 00:11:01,410
婚纱没事啦
The dress is fine.

263
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:02,750
是我多心了
I'm just being paranoid.

264
00:11:02,840 --> 00:11:04,960
好了  车来了  谁跟我们来
Ok. Truck's here. Who's coming?

265
00:11:05,970 --> 00:11:08,160
卡罗琳用半威胁的语气
Caroline suggested in a semi-threatening way

266
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,320
叫我来搬装饰物
that I pick up the centerpieces,

267
00:11:09,320 --> 00:11:11,410
依我的风格  感觉势必会搞砸的
which sounds like a Donovan screw-up waiting to happen.

268
00:11:11,410 --> 00:11:12,530
我来吧
I'll come!

269
00:11:12,710 --> 00:11:13,950
-谢谢  -嗯
- Thank you. - Yeah.

270
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:16,770
不是那儿  那里
No, not there. There.

271
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:18,170
再高点
Just a little bit higher.

272
00:11:18,170 --> 00:11:20,190
那不叫一点了
Well, that's not a little, but--

273
00:11:20,190 --> 00:11:21,390
我不擅长摆花吗
But I'm bad at flowers?

274
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,450
嗯  你早该知道了吧
Yeah. I assumed you knew that.

275
00:11:24,470 --> 00:11:27,090
卡罗琳  为什么叫我来
Caroline, why am I here?

276
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:32,630
我试图杀你
I tried to kill you.

277
00:11:32,630 --> 00:11:34,820
虽然我是关了人性  但我还是试图杀你
My humanity was off, but I still tried to kill you,

278
00:11:34,820 --> 00:11:37,390
你是我的朋友  我很抱歉
and you're my friend, and I'm sorry.

279
00:11:38,550 --> 00:11:39,660
说来有趣
That's funny.

280
00:11:40,720 --> 00:11:42,450
虽然我们早就翻篇了
You and I moved on a while ago,

281
00:11:42,750 --> 00:11:44,960
但被前任和她新男友折磨
but getting tortured by your ex and her new boyfriend

282
00:11:44,960 --> 00:11:46,700
还是会让人伤自尊
is never good for the ego.

283
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:48,110
他不是我男友
He's not my boyfriend.

284
00:11:48,110 --> 00:11:49,340
随便了
Whatever he is.

285
00:11:49,340 --> 00:11:50,030
我都跟不上节奏了
I can't keep up.

286
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:52,620
你要知道我是绝不会那么做的
You have to know I would never do anything like that

287
00:11:52,620 --> 00:11:53,230
都怪我...
if it weren't for--

288
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:54,690
没事啦  卡罗
You're good, Care,

289
00:11:54,820 --> 00:11:56,580
如果你想弥补
and if you want to make amends,

290
00:11:56,580 --> 00:11:58,300
就让我离开这里吧
let me get the hell out of here.

291
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,850
想得美
Nice try, ok,

292
00:11:59,850 --> 00:12:02,480
如果我要结婚了  而圣坛却是那个样子
but if I were getting married at an altar that looked like that,

293
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:03,620
我不到一周就得离婚
I would be divorced in a week,

294
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:05,110
加把劲吧  洛克伍德
so come on, Lockwood.

295
00:12:05,110 --> 00:12:05,970
下一排
Next row.

296
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:08,940
老实说  你还是自己做吧
Honestly, you should probably do that yourself.

297
00:12:09,380 --> 00:12:11,210
丽芙  你怎么来了
Liv, what are you doing here?

298
00:12:11,210 --> 00:12:13,780
你知道乔是我姐姐吧
You do know that Jo's my sister, right?

299
00:12:14,380 --> 00:12:16,090
太好了  又能冰释前嫌了
Goodie! More amends.

300
00:12:16,090 --> 00:12:18,520
喝杯酒会更好  烈酒
Drinks will help! Strong ones.

301
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:21,610
你看上去不错
You look good.

302
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:23,380
谢谢
Thanks.

303
00:12:23,660 --> 00:12:24,970
最近怎么样
How are things?

304
00:12:24,970 --> 00:12:25,670
挺好
Good.

305
00:12:25,670 --> 00:12:27,570
伤势还没完全恢复吗
Still recovering from that injury?

306
00:12:27,970 --> 00:12:28,740
什么伤势
What injury?

307
00:12:28,740 --> 00:12:31,680
害得你只会吐单音节词的头部创伤
Whatever head injury turned you into a monosyllabic goon.

308
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:35,830
单音节词  大学辍学生还会念这么长的词
Monosyllabic. That's an awfully big word for a college dropout.

309
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:38,320
抱歉了  我难道还该留在惠特曼大学吗
Oh, I'm sorry. Was I supposed to stay at Whitmore

310
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,610
我的混蛋男朋友跟我说他再也不想见到我了
after my ass of a boyfriend told me he never wanted to see me again?

311
00:12:41,610 --> 00:12:42,830
等等  你还生我的气吗
Hang on. You're mad at me?

312
00:12:42,840 --> 00:12:45,950
我一周内先后失去了孪生弟弟和男友
I lost my brother and then my boyfriend in the span of a week.

313
00:12:45,950 --> 00:12:47,040
你不向我寻求安慰
And instead of coming to me,

314
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:48,430
而是企图自杀
you tried to kill yourself.

315
00:12:48,430 --> 00:12:49,200
我当时很伤心
I was hurt.

316
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:50,200
那也不是借口
That doesn't make it ok.

317
00:12:50,200 --> 00:12:53,030
你还要就发火的问题教训我吗
You're lecturing me on flying off the handle?

318
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,480
这样吧
You know what?

319
00:12:55,920 --> 00:12:57,600
我还是去外面等着吧
I'm gonna wait outside.

320
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,750
双子巫师团的婚礼会有很多巫师到场
Gemini wedding means big coven reunion heading this way.

321
00:13:12,070 --> 00:13:13,710
埃琳娜说她在风干
Elena says she's desiccating

322
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,210
所以才那么疯狂  但是...
and that's why she's crazy, but--

323
00:13:15,210 --> 00:13:16,270
是啊
Yeah.

324
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:19,950
她上周没在风干的时候就杀过两个人
She killed two people last week when she wasn't desiccating.

325
00:13:19,950 --> 00:13:20,870
我知道这听上去很疯狂
I know this will sound crazy,

326
00:13:20,870 --> 00:13:22,760
但我一直在做恶梦
but I've been having these nightmares

327
00:13:23,300 --> 00:13:24,750
梦到她和卡伊
with her and Kai.

328
00:13:29,250 --> 00:13:30,360
给
Here.

329
00:13:31,020 --> 00:13:32,070
这是什么
What's this?

330
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:34,360
邦妮·贝内特如果有了预感
When Bonnie Bennett has a hunch,

331
00:13:35,090 --> 00:13:36,410
是不容忽视的
you don't ignore it.

332
00:13:37,310 --> 00:13:38,080
你觉得我们该怎么办
What do you think we should do?

333
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:39,420
我知道我们不该怎么做
I know what we shouldn't do--

334
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:41,700
让两个我们不信任的人处理她
leave her in the hands of two people we don't trust.

335
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:44,410
嗯  不错啊
Yeah, it's nice.

336
00:13:44,700 --> 00:13:46,090
巴西硬木材
Brazilian hardwoods,

337
00:13:46,090 --> 00:13:47,620
开放式隔间
open floor plan,

338
00:13:47,620 --> 00:13:49,230
最新样式的厨房
updated kitchen.

339
00:13:51,330 --> 00:13:53,400
你在做什么碾死动物呢
What kind of roadkill are you cooking in there?

340
00:13:53,400 --> 00:13:56,640
鉴于你得像人类那样吃东西
Well, considering the fact that you actually have to eat as a human,

341
00:13:56,640 --> 00:13:57,510
我想让你看看
I just wanted to give you a little taste

342
00:13:57,510 --> 00:13:59,350
你的晚餐以后会是什么样
of what your dinner's gonna look like.

343
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:02,810
你不会做饭  埃琳娜也不会
You don't cook, Elena doesn't cook.

344
00:14:02,810 --> 00:14:05,190
而且要工作带孩子  谁有时间啊
Who has time anyway with work and kids, right?

345
00:14:08,280 --> 00:14:10,390
索尔斯伯利牛肉饼  开动吧  达蒙
Salisbury steak. Dig in, Damon.

346
00:14:10,390 --> 00:14:13,830
你会需要体力  看这个
You're gonna need all that energy for these.

347
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:15,270
那是什么
Oh, yeah? What's this?

348
00:14:16,490 --> 00:14:17,760
你的余生
That's just the rest of your life.

349
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:19,820
文件  这就是你的妙招
Paperwork? That's your big move?

350
00:14:19,820 --> 00:14:20,420
我问问你
Let me ask you something.

351
00:14:20,420 --> 00:14:22,740
你上次填写任何的文件是什么时候了
When was the last time you filled out paperwork of any kind--

352
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:25,050
报税  人寿保险  驾照
taxes, health insurance, driver's license?

353
00:14:25,050 --> 00:14:26,750
全国上下哪个人不会啊
Every idiot in the country does it.

354
00:14:26,750 --> 00:14:28,230
这东西能是问题吗
You think I'm gonna have trouble with this?

355
00:14:28,600 --> 00:14:30,520
等你第一次遇到你不能杀  不能催眠的白痴
You will the first time you encounter some moron

356
00:14:30,520 --> 00:14:31,850
就会成为问题了
that you can't kill or compel.

357
00:14:31,850 --> 00:14:33,640
或许吧  那我就回家来
Maybe. Then I would just come home

358
00:14:33,640 --> 00:14:38,260
从我漂亮的不锈钢冰箱里拿瓶酒出来
and pop a beer from my beautiful stainless steel refrigerator.

359
00:14:38,260 --> 00:14:40,950
而你如果没有工作  就买不起这些
Which you won't be able to afford unless you have a job,

360
00:14:40,950 --> 00:14:43,210
如果你要说你可以跟我借钱
and if you're about to say you can borrow money from me,

361
00:14:43,210 --> 00:14:43,840
那是不行的
you can't.

362
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,790
这可不像好兄弟啊
Well, that's not very brotherly of you.

363
00:14:45,790 --> 00:14:46,810
这就是好兄弟该做的
Actually it is. See, 

364
00:14:46,810 --> 00:14:48,150
因为我到时不会知道你在哪
I won't know where you live.

365
00:14:48,150 --> 00:14:50,020
你身体里会流淌着解药
You'll have the cure running through your veins,

366
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:51,110
而我如果知道你在哪
and if I know where you are,

367
00:14:51,110 --> 00:14:54,020
那别人就可以通过我找到你
then someone can use me to track you down

368
00:14:54,020 --> 00:14:55,180
夺走你的解药
and take the cure from you

369
00:14:55,180 --> 00:14:57,980
然后把你变成172岁的尸体
and turn you into a 172-year-old corpse.

370
00:14:58,260 --> 00:15:00,220
怎么了  这点还没想过吗
What's the matter? Haven't thought that far ahead?

371
00:15:00,370 --> 00:15:02,830
最终  消息会传开
See, eventually, word will spread,

372
00:15:02,830 --> 00:15:05,090
你和埃琳娜就得逃跑了
and you and Elena will have to move away.

373
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:06,920
你们得与世隔绝
You'll have to isolate yourself,

374
00:15:06,930 --> 00:15:09,220
不能与朋友家人待在一起
no friends, no family.

375
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:11,470
这就是你今后的生活了  达蒙
This will be your life, Damon.

376
00:15:11,750 --> 00:15:14,110
你的地狱
This will be your hell.

377
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:20,510
你错就错在这里了  弟弟
Well, that is where you are wrong, my brother.

378
00:15:21,620 --> 00:15:23,200
我的生活不会是这样
This will not be my life.

379
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:26,820
这才是
This will be my life.

380
00:15:26,830 --> 00:15:28,820
埃琳娜对她想要的生活说得很清楚
See, Elena was pretty explicit about what she wanted.

381
00:15:28,820 --> 00:15:30,290
这虽然不是特里贝克地区
Now this isn't tribeca.

382
00:15:30,290 --> 00:15:31,770
我嫌纽约太挤了
New York's a little too crowded for me,

383
00:15:31,770 --> 00:15:34,380
但这栋公寓在我所有的一间酒吧楼上
but it is above a bar that I own 

384
00:15:34,380 --> 00:15:36,220
还挨着一所医学院
next to a medical school.

385
00:15:36,390 --> 00:15:37,700
在西北某处
It's in the northwest somewhere.

386
00:15:37,700 --> 00:15:38,670
我倒是愿意告诉你地点
I mean, I'd tell you where it was,

387
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:41,040
但你显然是不想知道
but you made it abundantly clear you didn't want to know.

388
00:15:44,610 --> 00:15:46,120
我去楼上看看
I'm gonna check out upstairs.

389
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:54,700
我喝三杯了  慢点说
I'm on my third glass, so speak slowly.

390
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:56,220
你知道我们都担心
You know how you and I were both worried

391
00:15:56,220 --> 00:15:57,910
他没想清楚吗
that he didn't think this through?

392
00:15:58,270 --> 00:15:59,290
他想得很清楚
He thought it through.

393
00:15:59,640 --> 00:16:01,540
这是达蒙啊  不可能的
It's Damon. He didn't.

394
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:02,830
他真准备好了  埃琳娜
He's ready to do this, Elena.

395
00:16:02,830 --> 00:16:04,760
他把你完美的人生都规划好了
He's got your perfect little life all planned out.

396
00:16:04,760 --> 00:16:08,120
我也想跟他过完美的人类人生  斯特凡  真的
I want the perfect human life with him, too, Stefan, trust me,

397
00:16:08,120 --> 00:16:09,910
但生活是不完美的
But life isn't perfect.

398
00:16:10,030 --> 00:16:11,570
你还有几小时时间
Ok? Look. You have a few more hours,

399
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:14,750
再逼逼他  让他想通
so push him, make him see that.

400
00:16:26,470 --> 00:16:28,720
记得你刚刚还想慢慢喝吗
Remember when you were pacing yourself?

401
00:16:29,080 --> 00:16:30,020
是啊
I do.

402
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:32,250
但我刚刚才让我前男友
Right before I told my ex-boyfriend

403
00:16:32,380 --> 00:16:33,830
想办法让我现男友
how to get my current boyfriend

404
00:16:33,840 --> 00:16:36,220
放弃我们在一起的希望
to give up hope for our relationship.

405
00:16:37,050 --> 00:16:39,460
如果我服下解药是个错误呢
What if I made a huge mistake by taking the cure?

406
00:16:39,460 --> 00:16:40,670
你唯一的错误
The only mistake you made

407
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:42,860
就在于最后的那杯香槟
was that last glass of champagne.

408
00:16:42,860 --> 00:16:43,920
我去煮点咖啡
I'm gonna go make some coffee

409
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:46,170
免得你栽在地上  掉到地球对面去
before you spiral through the earth to China.

410
00:16:46,170 --> 00:16:47,370
好吧
Yeah, ok.

411
00:16:52,860 --> 00:16:53,950
乔
Jo?

412
00:16:55,230 --> 00:16:56,370
你没事吧
Are you ok?

413
00:16:56,490 --> 00:16:57,580
乔
Jo!

414
00:16:57,860 --> 00:16:59,580
乔  乔
Hey, Jo, Jo!

415
00:17:02,380 --> 00:17:04,820
乔  乔
Jo! Jo!

416
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,860
医生拿到检测结果了
The doctor got the test results back.

417
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:20,250
孩子没事  你也没事
The babies are fine, you're fine.

418
00:17:20,250 --> 00:17:20,900
他认为这只是
He thinks it was just--

419
00:17:20,900 --> 00:17:22,270
惊恐发作
An acute panic attack

420
00:17:22,270 --> 00:17:23,950
由压力和怀孕
brought on by stress, pregnancy,

421
00:17:23,950 --> 00:17:25,620
和低血糖引发
and a severe lack of food.

422
00:17:25,620 --> 00:17:26,750
嗯
Yeah.

423
00:17:27,150 --> 00:17:30,480
你能不能做个好伴娘
What are the chances of you being an amazing maid of honor 

424
00:17:30,490 --> 00:17:33,270
不把这事说出去
and keeping this mortifying episode to yourself?

425
00:17:33,530 --> 00:17:34,970
我不想让里克担心
I don't want to worry Ric.

426
00:17:35,410 --> 00:17:36,560
当然了
Of course.

427
00:17:39,490 --> 00:17:41,060
你不能告诉她我告诉你了
You can't tell her that I told you.

428
00:17:41,070 --> 00:17:42,190
好吧  但我得见她
Ok. Fine, but I want to see her.

429
00:17:42,190 --> 00:17:43,580
-得等到婚礼之后  -埃琳娜
- Not till the wedding. - Elena!

430
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:46,430
里克  如果说你该在什么地方相信迷信
Ric, if there's anywhere that you should be superstitious,

431
00:17:46,430 --> 00:17:47,710
那绝对是神秘瀑布镇了
it's Mystic Falls.

432
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:49,200
好吧  但究竟怎么回事
Ok. Fine, but what happened?

433
00:17:49,620 --> 00:17:51,560
医生认为是惶恐发作
The doctors think that she had a panic attack.

434
00:17:51,570 --> 00:17:54,530
是不想嫁给我所以惶恐吗  这可好
As in she doesn't want to get married to me panic attack? Great.

435
00:17:54,540 --> 00:17:55,970
不  是因为今天是她的婚礼
No, as in it's her wedding day

436
00:17:55,980 --> 00:17:58,160
而且她还怀着一对儿孩子
and she has two small humans growing inside her

437
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:00,590
而且她又不能像你那样喝波本缓解紧张
and she can't self-medicate like you, bourbon breath.

438
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:05,660
抱歉  我看到她摔倒
Sorry. I just--I saw her fall,

439
00:18:05,660 --> 00:18:07,760
我的第一直觉是瞬跑过去
and my first instinct was to vamp to her,

440
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:08,970
但又做不到
but I couldn't,

441
00:18:08,970 --> 00:18:09,990
然后我看到她撞到了头
and then I saw her hit her head,

442
00:18:09,990 --> 00:18:11,700
我想给她吸血鬼血
and I wanted to give her vampire blood,

443
00:18:11,750 --> 00:18:12,970
我也不能
but I couldn't.

444
00:18:13,740 --> 00:18:15,450
等等  你是后悔了吗
Wait. So are you having second thoughts?

445
00:18:16,370 --> 00:18:18,500
没有  因为我又想
No, because then I thought,

446
00:18:18,500 --> 00:18:19,650
人类会怎么做呢
"What would a human do?"

447
00:18:19,650 --> 00:18:22,080
所以我打了911  送她去了医院
So I called 911, got her to the hospital,

448
00:18:22,080 --> 00:18:24,000
让医生履行职责
and then I let the doctors do their job,

449
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:26,320
这感觉很有力
and it felt oddly empowering.

450
00:18:26,860 --> 00:18:28,190
你怎么没说
Why didn't you tell me?

451
00:18:28,390 --> 00:18:29,680
说什么
Tell you what?

452
00:18:29,680 --> 00:18:32,080
重新成为人类是多棒的感觉
How amazing it feels to be human again.

453
00:18:32,410 --> 00:18:35,530
我起初还担心这会让我的感官迟钝
At first, I was worried that it might take the edge off my senses,

454
00:18:35,530 --> 00:18:37,830
但恰恰相反
but it's the opposite.

455
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:38,940
我觉得
I feel...

456
00:18:40,190 --> 00:18:41,950
自己又和世界产生联系了
Connected to the world again.

457
00:18:42,290 --> 00:18:43,440
我感觉
I feel...

458
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:45,160
有活力
Alive?

459
00:18:46,230 --> 00:18:47,140
是啊
Yeah.

460
00:18:47,140 --> 00:18:48,940
那是因为你的人生又有目标了
That's because your life has purpose again.

461
00:18:49,160 --> 00:18:50,220
又有限了
It's finite,

462
00:18:50,800 --> 00:18:52,030
这...
and it's...

463
00:18:53,910 --> 00:18:55,850
是最棒的感觉了
pretty much the greatest feeling in the whole world.

464
00:18:56,870 --> 00:18:59,030
我给你们调了很好喝的酒
I made you guys some amazing drinks

465
00:18:59,030 --> 00:19:00,570
还加了点龙舌兰
with a little bit of tequila.

466
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:02,250
好吧  加了好多
Ok. A lot of tequila.

467
00:19:02,470 --> 00:19:05,200
却只有你一个人
And there's only one of you.

468
00:19:06,300 --> 00:19:06,920
你做什么了
What did you do?

469
00:19:06,920 --> 00:19:08,210
我什么都没做
I didn't do anything.

470
00:19:08,770 --> 00:19:10,250
他气冲冲地说
He said angrily.

471
00:19:15,410 --> 00:19:16,590
什么都没变
Nothing has changed.

472
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,100
怎么  她换了件漂亮裙子
What? Because she walks in here

473
00:19:18,100 --> 00:19:19,270
和新发型走进来
with a pretty dress and a new haircut,

474
00:19:19,270 --> 00:19:20,520
我就该忘记她的行为吗
I'm supposed to forget how she acted?

475
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:22,800
不  你该像个大人那样跟她好好谈
No. You're supposed to talk to her like an adult

476
00:19:22,800 --> 00:19:24,230
解决你们的问题
and work out your problems.

477
00:19:24,230 --> 00:19:25,520
你根本不了解我们有什么问题
You don't know about our problems.

478
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:27,510
是啊  但我知道你的问题
No, but I know about your problems--

479
00:19:27,510 --> 00:19:28,500
除非你不介意
Unless you're cool with 

480
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:30,800
只在警校待两周
only making it two weeks in the police academy

481
00:19:30,800 --> 00:19:32,650
然后就失去人生目标
and then having no purpose in life.

482
00:19:32,650 --> 00:19:33,930
至少你跟她在一起时
At least when you had her,

483
00:19:33,930 --> 00:19:35,670
你还很努力  泰勒
you were trying, Tyler.

484
00:19:37,090 --> 00:19:39,860
你还跟我提感情建议
You're giving me advice about relationships

485
00:19:39,860 --> 00:19:41,750
你今年和斯特凡都闹了些什么事啊
after all your Stefan drama this year?

486
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:44,130
帮帮忙  先理清你自己的生活吧
Do me a favor. Figure out your own damn life.

487
00:19:44,220 --> 00:19:45,410
让我自己理清我的
Let me worry about mine.

488
00:19:50,340 --> 00:19:52,280
{\an8}斯特凡

489
00:19:54,600 --> 00:19:57,500
你的努力值得称赞  斯特凡
Well, I applaud you for your effort, Stefan,

490
00:19:57,500 --> 00:20:00,800
但未来生活展览之旅该结束了
but I think it's time for the "this is your life" tour to end.

491
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:01,560
地址你有了吗
You get the address?

492
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:02,680
有了  礼服也在车里
Yep. Tuxes are in the car.

493
00:20:02,680 --> 00:20:03,520
-随时可以出发  -很好
- We're good to go. - Good.

494
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:05,080
对了  还有一件事
Oh, hey! Just one more thing.

495
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:06,710
又怎么了
Ohh. What now?

496
00:20:06,890 --> 00:20:08,670
你是准备教我洗衣服
You gonna give me a lecture on laundry,

497
00:20:08,670 --> 00:20:10,960
换机油  还有注意个人卫生吗
oil changes, personal hygiene?

498
00:20:11,780 --> 00:20:14,140
-分手  -怎么了
- Breakups. - What about them?

499
00:20:14,140 --> 00:20:16,280
我猜你还没想过这个  对吗
Well, I guess you hadn't really thought about that, right?

500
00:20:16,280 --> 00:20:19,140
如果你和埃琳娜不是真的灵魂伴侣呢
What if you and Elena aren't really soul mates?

501
00:20:19,140 --> 00:20:20,600
你知道我向来不在乎标签  弟弟
You know I'm not very big on labels, bro,

502
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:22,230
但我想这方面我们应该没问题
but I think we're pretty good on that front.

503
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:24,980
你听起来跟四年前的我一模一样
Ahh. Yeah. You sound like me 4 years ago.

504
00:20:24,980 --> 00:20:28,000
知道吗  埃琳娜和我曾经也是灵魂伴侣
You know, Elena and me, we were soul mates, too.

505
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,490
说话小心点  斯特凡
Watch it, Stefan.

506
00:20:29,830 --> 00:20:31,120
我只是实话实说
Hey. I'm just being realistic.

507
00:20:31,120 --> 00:20:32,180
如果真的有了问题呢
I mean, what if something goes wrong?

508
00:20:32,180 --> 00:20:34,090
你将一直是人类  与世隔绝  
You're still human, still isolated,

509
00:20:34,090 --> 00:20:34,850
孤身一人
still alone.

510
00:20:34,850 --> 00:20:35,610
这不会发生的
Not gonna happen.

511
00:20:35,620 --> 00:20:37,720
没错  因为情侣都会幸福一辈子
Right because couples stay together forever.

512
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,870
从不吵架  也不会伤害对方
They never fight, they never hurt each other,

513
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:41,530
更不会渐行渐远
they never drift apart.

514
00:20:43,300 --> 00:20:44,430
我来让你看看
Let me show you.

515
00:20:55,920 --> 00:20:57,070
你还没睡呢
You're still up.

516
00:20:58,610 --> 00:20:59,800
今晚很辛苦吗
Rough night?

517
00:21:00,180 --> 00:21:02,260
只是有点漫长
Just...long.

518
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:05,410
我一直告诉自己
I keep having to tell myself

519
00:21:05,720 --> 00:21:07,310
只要再熬几年实习医生
a couple more years of residency,

520
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:08,970
我就能解脱了
and I'll be free.

521
00:21:09,160 --> 00:21:10,960
过来坐  陪我喝一杯
Come sit, have a drink with me.

522
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:12,440
说实话  我有点累
I'm actually kind of tired.

523
00:21:12,540 --> 00:21:14,200
我先去睡了
I'm gonna go to bed.

524
00:21:24,870 --> 00:21:27,810
天哪  埃琳娜有工作  快来人救救我
Oh, god! Elena has a job. Somebody, help me!

525
00:21:27,810 --> 00:21:29,410
这才是两年后的事
Oh, that's just two years in.

526
00:21:29,410 --> 00:21:30,830
等你看看七年之后再说吧
Wait till you hit 7.

527
00:21:37,410 --> 00:21:38,580
你好啊
Hello.

528
00:21:40,090 --> 00:21:41,250
你醉了
You're drunk.

529
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:46,120
你对我不满  奇怪了
I sense judgment, which is odd.

530
00:21:46,130 --> 00:21:47,930
不是你让我开酒吧的吗
You're the one that wanted me to own a bar.

531
00:21:48,060 --> 00:21:49,560
我是想让你开酒吧  达蒙
I wanted you to own it, Damon,

532
00:21:49,560 --> 00:21:51,410
不是每晚在那一醉方休
not pass out on it every night.

533
00:21:53,240 --> 00:21:55,650
知道吗  至少那酒吧比你热情多了
Yeah? Well, that bar's a lot more affectionate than you.

534
00:21:58,700 --> 00:22:00,770
我才结束实习医生的阶段  达蒙
I just finished my residency, Damon.

535
00:22:00,770 --> 00:22:02,870
我得努力工作打造一份事业
I'm working my butt off to build a career.

536
00:22:02,870 --> 00:22:05,420
是吗  我也在努力喝酒打造我的
Well, I'm drinking my butt off building mine.

537
00:22:05,420 --> 00:22:07,670
如果你这么不开心  那就卖了酒吧
If you're that unhappy, then just sell the bar.

538
00:22:08,140 --> 00:22:08,940
然后做什么
And do what?

539
00:22:08,950 --> 00:22:10,410
我不在乎  达蒙
I don't care, Damon.

540
00:22:10,580 --> 00:22:12,050
你想做什么都行
Whatever it is you want to do.

541
00:22:12,050 --> 00:22:13,550
问题就在这里  埃琳娜
Well, that's the thing, Elena.

542
00:22:13,930 --> 00:22:16,110
我不能做我想做的事
I can't do what I want to do

543
00:22:16,110 --> 00:22:18,310
因为我想做的是彻夜狂饮
because what I want to do is drink all night

544
00:22:18,310 --> 00:22:19,300
却能千杯不醉
without getting drunk,

545
00:22:19,300 --> 00:22:20,970
像疯子一样飙车
drive my car like a psycho

546
00:22:20,970 --> 00:22:22,330
而不用担心会死
without fear of death.

547
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:24,540
我想拧断别人的脑袋
I want to tear someone's head off

548
00:22:24,550 --> 00:22:25,600
也没有人能拘捕我
without getting arrested.

549
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:26,800
没错  达蒙
You're right, Damon.

550
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:28,600
你不能再做这些事了
You can't do any of those things anymore.

551
00:22:28,610 --> 00:22:29,790
因为你
Because of you.

552
00:22:30,540 --> 00:22:32,460
我不能  都是因为你
I can't because of you.

553
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:34,550
你就说吧
Just say it.

554
00:22:36,140 --> 00:22:37,530
这是个该死的错误
This was a damn mistake.

555
00:22:38,050 --> 00:22:39,210
没错
You're right.

556
00:22:39,590 --> 00:22:41,110
这是个错误
This was a mistake.

557
00:22:43,890 --> 00:22:45,290
滚出我的意识
Get out of my head!

558
00:22:48,470 --> 00:22:49,760
我知道你想干什么了
I see what you're doing.

559
00:22:51,180 --> 00:22:52,570
你不是担心我会孤独一人
This isn't about me being alone.

560
00:22:52,570 --> 00:22:54,320
而是担心你自己会孤独
This is about you being alone

561
00:22:54,510 --> 00:22:57,180
当你失去了我  失去了埃琳娜
without me, without Elena.

562
00:22:58,120 --> 00:22:59,870
你真自私  弟弟
Awfully selfish of you brother.

563
00:22:59,870 --> 00:23:02,060
就算你和埃琳娜
Even if you and Elena defy

564
00:23:02,060 --> 00:23:03,380
能排除万难
every single statistic

565
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:05,950
每一天每一刻都爱着对方
and stay in love every hour of every day...

566
00:23:07,550 --> 00:23:10,160
你仍不能掌握生老病死
you still can't control life or death.

567
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:12,520
她是人类  随时都可能死
She's human. She could die at any moment.

568
00:23:12,520 --> 00:23:14,670
如果没有了她  你的人生
What is your life gonna look like

569
00:23:14,790 --> 00:23:16,120
会变成怎么样
without her?

570
00:24:47,950 --> 00:24:49,860
你故意疏离我们的感情
So you make us drift apart,

571
00:24:51,310 --> 00:24:53,170
让我们分手  然后杀了她
break us up, and then kill her?

572
00:24:55,270 --> 00:24:56,740
这也太残忍了  弟弟
That's harsh, brother.

573
00:24:56,830 --> 00:24:58,260
是她希望我残忍一点
She wanted me to be harsh.

574
00:25:00,980 --> 00:25:02,320
这是她的主意
This is her idea, too.

575
00:25:02,720 --> 00:25:03,910
真可笑
Well, that's funny

576
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:06,480
跟我最亲近的两个人
because the two people closest to me

577
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:07,980
却最能狠心伤害我
are the two most sadistic.

578
00:25:10,130 --> 00:25:12,380
如果这么做  达蒙  你就会永远变成人类
You know, if you do this, Damon, you're human forever.

579
00:25:12,680 --> 00:25:15,470
无论发生什么  你都无法回头
No matter what happens, there's no going back.

580
00:25:21,220 --> 00:25:22,650
那你觉得我该怎么做
What do you think I should do?

581
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:24,400
问题就在这里  我没法告诉你
That's the thing. I can't tell you,

582
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:26,570
埃琳娜也没法告诉你
Elena can't tell you.

583
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:29,420
你不能为我或是为她这么做
You can't do this for me or for her.

584
00:25:30,010 --> 00:25:32,830
你必须自己想成为人类
You have to want to be human for yourself.

585
00:25:51,570 --> 00:25:53,900
抱歉  那边有人要酒
Oh, excuse me. They need some more drinks over there.

586
00:25:53,910 --> 00:25:55,190
谢谢
Thank you.

587
00:25:56,800 --> 00:25:58,040
乔呢  她
Hey! Where's Jo? Is she--

588
00:25:58,040 --> 00:25:59,820
她很好  他们让她去休息了
She's fine. They discharged her.

589
00:25:59,820 --> 00:26:02,880
很好  她可以去后门休息没人会打扰
Good. Well, there's a back entrance she can use that avoids being seen.

590
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:04,160
好的  我会告诉她
Ok. I'll tell her.

591
00:26:04,600 --> 00:26:05,820
很好
Great.

592
00:26:05,890 --> 00:26:07,260
斯特凡
Stefan.

593
00:26:09,110 --> 00:26:10,960
我还是去等乔了
I'm gonna go wait for jo.

594
00:26:11,010 --> 00:26:12,110
好
Ok.

595
00:26:13,490 --> 00:26:15,160
我还不是很习惯看到人们被我吓跑
I'm not used to scaring people away.

596
00:26:15,160 --> 00:26:17,810
人们见到穿晚礼服塞尔瓦托兄弟会不适应
People are uncomfortable around Salvatores in tuxes.

597
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:19,010
因为会让人们
It stirs...

598
00:26:19,640 --> 00:26:20,360
心潮澎湃
Feelings.

599
00:26:20,360 --> 00:26:22,060
埃琳娜又恢复人类的感觉了
Uh-oh. Elena's human again.

600
00:26:22,060 --> 00:26:24,010
是不是又要换人了
Am I sensing another brother swap?

601
00:26:26,690 --> 00:26:27,510
他和你一起来了吗
Is he with you?

602
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:30,050
没有  他需要时间思考
No. He needed some time to think.

603
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:31,910
这听起来不是很好啊
That sounds very ominous.

604
00:26:34,690 --> 00:26:36,600
你不想让他服药  对吗
You don't want him to take it, do you?

605
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,980
那不是我的选择
Well, it's not up to me.

606
00:26:38,490 --> 00:26:39,510
斯特凡  我不是他
Stefan, I'm not him.

607
00:26:39,510 --> 00:26:41,090
你可以告诉我真实感受的
You can tell me how you really feel.

608
00:26:42,150 --> 00:26:43,460
当然了  我是不希望他服药
Look. Of course, I don't want him to take it.

609
00:26:43,460 --> 00:26:45,140
他是我哥哥
He's my brother.

610
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:47,140
一想到要失去他
The thought of losing him is--

611
00:26:47,710 --> 00:26:49,060
我懂的
Yeah, I know.

612
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:51,700
那你觉得他会怎么做
So what do you think he's gonna do?

613
00:26:53,730 --> 00:26:55,630
你不认识人类的达蒙
Well, you never knew Damon as a human.

614
00:26:56,560 --> 00:26:58,030
他漫不经心
He was aimless,

615
00:26:58,200 --> 00:27:00,310
总在寻找更多
always searching for something more,

616
00:27:00,500 --> 00:27:02,300
人很好很热心
sweet and earnest to a fault

617
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,760
但他并不是个坚强的人
but never strong.

618
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:15,780
当他找到了自己才变得坚强
That came later when he found himself,

619
00:27:16,940 --> 00:27:19,210
成为了现在的达蒙
when he truly became Damon.

620
00:27:20,100 --> 00:27:22,220
他喜欢当吸血鬼
He loves being a vampire,

621
00:27:23,290 --> 00:27:25,370
我只是觉得他没法放弃
and I just don't think he'll ever give that up.

622
00:27:28,450 --> 00:27:29,650
她会杀掉我们的
She's gonna kill us.

623
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:30,480
我以为重点就在于
I thought the whole point of this 

624
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,690
我们是要去控制住她
is that we were in control of her.

625
00:27:31,690 --> 00:27:33,400
我不是说莉莉  我是说卡罗琳
Not Lily. Caroline.

626
00:27:33,460 --> 00:27:34,930
婚礼还有一小时就要开始了
The wedding starts in an hour.

627
00:27:34,980 --> 00:27:36,270
我们只要打晕她
All we have to do is knock her ass out

628
00:27:36,270 --> 00:27:37,380
然后拖去锅炉房就行了
and drag her to the boiler room.

629
00:27:37,380 --> 00:27:38,790
最多三十分钟
30 minutes tops.

630
00:27:43,660 --> 00:27:44,740
邦妮
Bonnie.

631
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:49,230
肯定是恩佐把她放出来了
Enzo must have let her out.

632
00:27:49,760 --> 00:27:51,230
我得赶紧警告大家
I have to warn everyone.

633
00:27:57,550 --> 00:27:58,630
马特
Matt?

634
00:27:59,470 --> 00:28:00,250
马特  你怎么了
Matt, what's wrong?

635
00:28:00,260 --> 00:28:01,210
我没法呼吸了
I can't breathe.

636
00:28:01,210 --> 00:28:02,560
好像有人掐住了我的脖子
It's like someone's crushing my throat.

637
00:28:02,560 --> 00:28:03,960
你坚持住  我
Ok. Just hang on. I'll--

638
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:09,190
马特
Matt.

639
00:28:20,850 --> 00:28:23,040
来杯茶  谢谢  伯爵茶
Tea, please. Earl grey.

640
00:28:27,700 --> 00:28:29,710
什么风把你吹来了
And to what do I owe the pleasure?

641
00:28:29,770 --> 00:28:31,530
我听说你本来要给我带一个
I heard you tried to bring me something called

642
00:28:31,530 --> 00:28:34,280
MP3播放器
an, uh, MP3 player.

643
00:28:34,370 --> 00:28:36,310
我还不知道那是什么
I'm not entirely sure what that is,

644
00:28:36,310 --> 00:28:38,270
但我还是想感谢你一下
but still, I wanted to thank you.

645
00:28:38,310 --> 00:28:40,980
然后他们就放你出来向我道谢了吗
And they let you out of your cell to do this?

646
00:28:40,980 --> 00:28:42,170
当然不是
Of course not,

647
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:43,970
但我很有办法的
but I'm resourceful.

648
00:28:46,340 --> 00:28:48,330
我是不是应该担心
Hmm. Should I be concerned

649
00:28:48,330 --> 00:28:50,130
你要兴起一场腥风血雨了
about an imminent ripper binge?

650
00:28:50,130 --> 00:28:52,080
事实上  不用
Actually, no, you shouldn't.

651
00:28:52,900 --> 00:28:55,890
我成了开膛手是因为我失去了我的家人
I was a ripper because I lost my family,

652
00:28:56,860 --> 00:28:58,840
但今天  我会找回他们
but today, I'm getting them back.

653
00:29:10,590 --> 00:29:13,000
如果你是想偷偷约我出去
If you're trying to organize a secret rendezvous--

654
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:14,280
别担心  不是的
Don't worry. I'm not.

655
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:16,070
只是我的婚誓需要点帮忙
I just need help with my vows.

656
00:29:16,270 --> 00:29:17,860
什么词能和战地止血钳押韵
What rhymes with battlefield clamp?

657
00:29:17,860 --> 00:29:19,100
离婚行吗
Divorce?

658
00:29:19,880 --> 00:29:21,200
你写的怎么样了
So how are yours coming?

659
00:29:21,350 --> 00:29:23,180
别再套我的话了
Stop fishing for spoilers.

660
00:29:23,180 --> 00:29:25,620
这里到处都是双子巫师团的人
You know, this place is crawling with Gemini.

661
00:29:25,820 --> 00:29:27,350
你们的巫师居然有这么多人啊
Who knew there were so many of you?

662
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:30,550
因为在巫师团除了生孩子也没什么事干了
Well, there's not much to do in the coven other than procreate.

663
00:29:31,990 --> 00:29:33,440
我爸爸没来吧
You haven't seen my dad, have you?

664
00:29:33,440 --> 00:29:35,500
我还没见到  但你能
No, actually, but it's big of you

665
00:29:35,500 --> 00:29:37,790
邀请一位谋杀你未遂的人真的很大度
to invite your attempted murderer to your wedding.

666
00:29:37,800 --> 00:29:39,580
因为他会送贵重礼物
He gives really good gifts.

667
00:29:40,070 --> 00:29:41,550
还有  不要对孕妇说
Oh, and never say, "Big of you,"

668
00:29:41,550 --> 00:29:42,880
和大肚谐音的词
to a pregnant woman.

669
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:46,590
见不到你真的很郁闷
I hate that I can't see you right now.

670
00:29:48,010 --> 00:29:49,510
真开心你为这郁闷
I love that you hate it.

671
00:29:49,950 --> 00:29:50,990
待会儿见
See you soon.

672
00:29:50,990 --> 00:29:52,130
拜拜
Bye.

673
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:55,280
也许我还是
Maybe I should just, uh,

674
00:29:55,280 --> 00:29:57,150
放下礼物就走人
leave my gift and go then.

675
00:29:59,900 --> 00:30:00,970
爸爸
Dad.

676
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:03,010
你怎么回来了
What are you doing back here?

677
00:30:03,100 --> 00:30:04,220
你是我女儿啊
You're my daughter,

678
00:30:04,940 --> 00:30:06,670
我...
And I, um--ahem--

679
00:30:06,880 --> 00:30:08,150
我不指望你会同意
I don't expect you to say yes,

680
00:30:08,150 --> 00:30:09,160
但是
but...

681
00:30:10,140 --> 00:30:12,990
但如果我都不问你要不要陪你走红地毯
if I didn't at least ask to walk you down the aisle,

682
00:30:14,010 --> 00:30:15,500
我自己都不能接受
I couldn't live with myself.

683
00:30:24,130 --> 00:30:25,390
你在躲着我
You're avoiding me.

684
00:30:26,900 --> 00:30:29,580
什么  没有  我才没有
What?! No. I'm not avoiding you.

685
00:30:29,580 --> 00:30:32,890
我是在尽力组织好这一片混乱
I'm trying to organize this whole circus here.

686
00:30:32,890 --> 00:30:33,940
你看到他们把酒水台放哪儿了吗
I mean, did you see where they put the bar?

687
00:30:33,950 --> 00:30:35,080
卡罗琳
Caroline...

688
00:30:36,480 --> 00:30:37,490
我们能聊聊吗
Can we talk?

689
00:30:41,150 --> 00:30:41,990
好吧  我就直说了
All right. Just say it.

690
00:30:41,990 --> 00:30:43,560
我错了  我太以自己为中心
I'm wrong, I'm making this about me,

691
00:30:43,560 --> 00:30:44,460
我很自私
I'm being selfish.

692
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:46,310
不  抱歉  不想失去你哥哥
No. Sorry. Not wanting to lose your brother

693
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:49,400
不能算是自私
is pretty low on the selfish scale.

694
00:30:50,990 --> 00:30:55,290
然而逼迫别人关闭人性...
Forcing someone to turn off their humanity on the other hand, that--

695
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:59,090
是啊  那就算得上是自私了
Hmm. Yeah. That's, uh-- that's way up there.

696
00:30:59,090 --> 00:31:00,040
是啊
Yeah.

697
00:31:06,700 --> 00:31:07,810
你恨我吗
Do you hate me?

698
00:31:07,950 --> 00:31:09,850
不  我当然不恨你
No. Of course, I don't hate you.

699
00:31:11,090 --> 00:31:13,340
但我不喜欢你处理问题的方式
That doesn't mean that I don't hate the way you handled things.

700
00:31:13,340 --> 00:31:14,970
我也是
Well, that makes two of us.

701
00:31:19,460 --> 00:31:20,540
我列了个清单
I made a list...

702
00:31:22,430 --> 00:31:26,660
是自从我爱上你之后所做的所有事情
of, um, all the things that I've done since I fell for you.

703
00:31:27,810 --> 00:31:30,680
是从去年夏天你搬走时开始的
It started last summer when you moved away.

704
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:33,480
我开始特别在意你去了哪儿
I started obsessing over where you were,

705
00:31:33,510 --> 00:31:35,310
想知道你为什么不回我电话
wondering why you weren't returning my calls.

706
00:31:35,310 --> 00:31:37,920
感觉被忽视时我就跟你说我恨你
I told you I hated you when I felt ignored,

707
00:31:37,960 --> 00:31:40,940
因为在吻你而错过我妈妈的临终时刻
missed my mom's final moments because I was kissing you,

708
00:31:40,940 --> 00:31:42,250
随后她过世了
and then she died...

709
00:31:42,250 --> 00:31:43,030
卡罗琳
Caroline.

710
00:31:43,030 --> 00:31:44,170
我只想要
And all I needed

711
00:31:44,170 --> 00:31:48,080
你能告诉我  你对我也有所感觉
was for you to tell me that you felt something for me,

712
00:31:49,480 --> 00:31:50,720
而你没有
and you didn't,

713
00:31:51,990 --> 00:31:53,610
这对我造成了很深的影响
and it affected me so deeply that

714
00:31:53,610 --> 00:31:57,160
以至于我做出了吸血鬼能做的最可怕的事情
I did the worst possible thing a vampire can do.

715
00:31:57,980 --> 00:31:59,670
我关闭了人性
I turned off my humanity,

716
00:31:59,900 --> 00:32:01,840
就在我以为我再也不能做出什么坏事时
and when I thought I couldn't do anything else,

717
00:32:01,840 --> 00:32:03,970
还让你关闭了你的人性
I got you to turn off yours.

718
00:32:07,610 --> 00:32:08,970
我原谅你
Well, I forgive you.

719
00:32:08,970 --> 00:32:11,040
但问题就在这里  斯特凡
Yeah, but that's the point, Stefan.

720
00:32:11,550 --> 00:32:13,670
原来的卡罗琳不会原谅我
The old Caroline wouldn't have forgiven me.

721
00:32:13,670 --> 00:32:15,440
她会给我一耳光然后说
She would have smacked me and said,

722
00:32:15,450 --> 00:32:17,640
"你到底在干什么"
"What the hell are you doing?"

723
00:32:18,590 --> 00:32:22,010
我讨厌这样的感觉
I hate the way that this has made me feel.

724
00:32:22,020 --> 00:32:25,040
那是因为你是一个失去控制的控制狂
That's because you're a control freak who's lost control.

725
00:32:25,040 --> 00:32:27,210
我在你身边也会有这样的感觉
I feel the same way when I'm around you.

726
00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:29,310
爱上一个人就是这样的
That's what falling for somebody is.

727
00:32:30,290 --> 00:32:31,670
会很脆弱
It's being vulnerable.

728
00:32:32,990 --> 00:32:33,980
是要...
It's...

729
00:32:35,650 --> 00:32:37,000
放弃控制
giving up control.

730
00:32:41,370 --> 00:32:42,360
我知道
I know...

731
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:48,690
但现在我的生活
But where I'm at right now in my life

732
00:32:49,310 --> 00:32:51,390
伴随着内疚和悲痛
with the guilt and the grief,

733
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:54,250
控制是我仅剩的
control is all I have,

734
00:32:56,220 --> 00:32:58,470
我觉得我没法放弃这一点
and I don't think that I can give that up.

735
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:28,890
伴娘裙不该会是
Isn't a bridesmaid's dress supposed to

736
00:33:28,890 --> 00:33:30,740
让你看起来很奇怪吗
make you look like a freak of nature?

737
00:33:32,670 --> 00:33:34,160
乔对我很客气
Jo went easy on me.

738
00:33:39,400 --> 00:33:40,910
我跟斯特凡谈过了
I talked to Stefan.

739
00:33:42,140 --> 00:33:43,970
他对我可不客气
He did not go easy on me.

740
00:33:44,510 --> 00:33:46,010
显然  这是你的错
Apparently, that's your fault.

741
00:33:46,650 --> 00:33:48,420
他的说法还是很具说服力的
His argument was pretty convincing.

742
00:33:51,380 --> 00:33:52,890
我下定了决心
I'd made up my mind...

743
00:33:55,030 --> 00:33:56,120
但之后
But then...

744
00:33:56,880 --> 00:33:58,810
你毁了我的球
You ruined my ball!

745
00:33:58,810 --> 00:34:01,070
你很幸运我没毁了你的脸
Well, you're lucky I didn't ruin your face!

746
00:34:01,070 --> 00:34:03,460
进屋  把妈妈的车钥匙拿来
Go inside, get the car keys from your mommy.

747
00:34:03,490 --> 00:34:04,700
我要去参加婚礼
I'm going to a wedding.

748
00:34:11,870 --> 00:34:13,370
重新考虑
On second thought.

749
00:34:14,860 --> 00:34:15,910
别忘了
Don't forget the--

750
00:34:15,910 --> 00:34:17,050
剩菜
The leftovers.

751
00:34:17,050 --> 00:34:19,740
我知道  你都说了三次了
I know. You told me 3 times.

752
00:34:19,740 --> 00:34:21,710
40年  每一次
40 years, and every time,

753
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:23,870
"你记得拿剩菜了吗"
"Did you remember the leftovers?"

754
00:34:23,870 --> 00:34:26,410
好像我变得年迈了似的
Like I'm getting senile or something.

755
00:34:49,300 --> 00:34:50,570
我接受
I'm taking it.

756
00:34:51,660 --> 00:34:54,100
我做吸血鬼已经很久了  埃琳娜
I've been a vampire for a long time, Elena.

757
00:34:55,110 --> 00:34:56,580
这事情很有冲击力
It's been a blast,

758
00:34:57,090 --> 00:34:59,700
但我会放弃吸血鬼的身份  只要能成为你的丈夫
but I would give it up in a second to be your husband,

759
00:35:00,450 --> 00:35:01,480
你的配偶
your partner,

天哪  这样的誓言太难超越了

840
00:40:54,950 --> 00:40:56,140
这是我的誓言
Here goes.

841
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:00,580
阿拉里克·萨尔茨曼  你是

842
00:41:02,980 --> 00:41:05,000
乔  怎么了
Jo? What is it?

843
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,300
乔  我的天
Jo? Oh, my god.

00:41:06,420 --> 00:41:07,680
乔
Jo? 

845
00:41:10,090 --> 00:41:11,210
我的天  不

我的天  不不不

848
00:41:18,840 --> 00:41:21,210
我本打算等到"直到死亡将我们分开"
I was gonna wait till the "Death do us part" bit,

849
00:41:21,420 --> 00:41:23,530
但似乎这样也恰好
but it seemed a little on the nose.

850
00:41:26,490 --> 00:41:27,720
不是吗
Am I right?

851
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,070
想我了吗
Miss me?

852
00:41:40,710 --> 00:41:41,860
