自从搬到法国换了我的身份证之后

970
00:47:48,366 --> 00:47:50,600
FROM MOVING TO FRANCE AND CHANGING MY IDENTITY.
我就与浪漫越来越远

971
00:47:50,602 --> 00:47:52,168

I'M JUST--I'VE BEEN PLOTTING ON HOW
我只是在想

982
00:48:13,524 --> 00:48:15,324
TO GET YOU EAT ONE OF THESE OLIVES,
如何才能让你吃一颗橄榄

983
00:48:15,326 --> 00:48:18,060
BECAUSE THEY'RE COVERED IN GARLIC,

AND WE'VE ALREADY HAD SOME.
我们已经吃过了

985
00:48:21,332 --> 00:48:24,233

I GUESS IT'S SORT OF AN ALL OR NOTHING KIND OF THING.

00:48:33,677 --> 00:48:35,544
PROBLEM SOLVED.

988
00:49:07,477 --> 00:49:10,313

00:49:46,551 --> 00:49:48,217
WHAT ABOUT THE DUDES?

00:57:56,941 --> 00:57:58,841
UH, SORRY TO DISAPPOINT.
不好意思啊，让你失望了

1063
00:57:58,843 --> 00:58:00,642
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?
你在这里做什么?

1064
00:58:00,644 --> 00:58:02,845
MY SISTER AND I MADE A BET.
我和我妹妹打了个赌

1065
00:58:02,847 --> 00:58:04,847
I'M GUESSING SHE WON?
我猜她赢了吧

00:58:04,849 --> 00:58:07,216

SHIRIN, STOP.
Shirin，听我说

I'M SORRY.I DON'T KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.
对不起，我自己都不清楚刚刚发生了什么

1073
00:59:07,211 --> 00:59:08,710
WHAT THE FUCK? HE'S A MAN.
什么？他可是个男人！

1074
00:59:08,712 --> 00:59:10,245
IT WAS LIKE KISSING A BABY.
就像吻小孩一样

1075
00:59:10,247 --> 00:59:11,313
WHAT?
什么？

1076
00:59:11,315 --> 00:59:14,016
IT'S JUST LIKE LIPS TOUCHING.
就只是碰碰嘴唇而已，不带感情

1077
00:59:14,018 --> 00:59:15,117
I HATE YOU SO MUCH WHEN YOU'RE DRINKING.
我太讨厌你喝酒了

00:59:23,694 --> 00:59:26,161
I FEEL SICK.
我很难过

1084
00:59:27,664 --> 00:59:29,565
PLEASE DON'T CRY.
别哭

JUST SOME GUY AT THE BAR.WE WERE JUST DRINKING.

AND YOU WERE LIKE,"WANT TO KISS A LESBIAN?"
但你表现得就像是“想试试亲亲蕾丝吗”

1090
00:59:39,810 --> 00:59:40,976
IT ONLY LASTED A SECOND.
可是那只是很短时间的事情啊

1091
00:59:40,978 --> 00:59:42,911
I WAS WATCHING YOU. IT WAS FOREVER.
我看了你很久，你们就像是要吻到天荒地老一样

1092
00:59:42,913 --> 00:59:45,881
HEY. I AM SORRY.
我错了

1093
00:59:45,883 --> 00:59:47,616
YOU HAVE TO FORGIVE ME.
你得原谅我

MAY I HELP YOU?
有什么我可以帮您的吗？

01:00:17,381 --> 01:00:19,648
I'VE GOT THAT.
我懂了

01:00:21,384 --> 01:00:25,220
THIS JUST CAME IN FROM FRANCE.
这是刚从法国到的货

1102
01:00:25,222 --> 01:00:26,989
IT'S A BIT PINK.
有点小粉红啊

1103
01:00:26,991 --> 01:00:28,357
WELL, WHY DON'T YOU TRY IT ON FOR YOURSELF?
你可以试穿一下

1104
01:00:28,359 --> 01:00:29,725
LET ME KNOW WHAT YOU NEED,
然后让我知道你需要什么

1105

I ACTUALLY NEED TO STOCK UP ON PANTIES.

MY EX-GIRLFRIEND UH, CUT UP MOST OF MINE,
我的前女友几乎把我的内裤全剪了

WHY NOT?
为什么不

1111
01:00:41,672 --> 01:00:42,838
JUST DON'T HAVE THAT MUCH TO WORK WITH,
没什么必要穿

1112
01:00:42,840 --> 01:00:44,373
SO IT FEELS A LITTLE SILLY.
而且胸罩有点蠢

1113
01:00:44,375 --> 01:00:46,842
YOU KNOW, LIKE WHEN LITTLE GIRLS CARRY PURSES.
就像小女孩都用起了手提包一样

1114

YOU ARE A WOMAN, AND YOU HAVE BREASTS,
你是一个女人，你有胸

1118
01:00:52,716 --> 01:00:54,216

我知道

1120
01:00:56,920 --> 01:00:58,387
YOU DESERVE A SEXY, SUPPORTIVE BRA,
你需要一款性感的、有支撑作用的内衣

1121
01:00:58,389 --> 01:00:59,821
JUST LIKE ANY OTHER WOMAN.
就像其他女人一样

1122
01:00:59,823 --> 01:01:01,957
OKAY.
好吧

1123
01:01:01,959 --> 01:01:03,659
YOU WERE WITH A WOMAN FOR HOW LONG,
你跟你的前女友在一起有多久？

1124
01:01:03,661 --> 01:01:05,260
AND SHE DIDN'T HELP YOU FIND THE RIGHT BRA?
她居然没有帮你寻找到一款适合你的内衣

1125
01:01:05,262 --> 01:01:07,295
A WHILE.
一段时间吧

01:01:07,297 --> 01:01:09,264
WELL, IT SOUNDS LIKE YOUR EX-- WHAT'S HER NAME?
我觉得你前女友…她叫什么名字？

01:01:09,266 --> 01:01:10,999
MAXINE.
她叫Maxine

1128
01:01:11,001 --> 01:01:13,301
SOUNDS LIKE MAXINE WAS DESTRUCTIVE TO YOUR PANTIES
听起来，Maxine不仅摧毁了你的内裤

1129
01:01:13,303 --> 01:01:15,303
AND YOUR SELF-ESTEEM.
还摧毁了你的自信
I'M SO SORRY.
不好意思

1130
01:01:15,305 --> 01:01:16,905
IS THIS REALLY NECESSARY?
这真的有必要吗？

1131
01:01:16,907 --> 01:01:19,141
I'M FINE.I JU-- I JUST NEED UNDERWEAR.
没关系，反正我只是需要内裤而已

1132
01:01:19,143 --> 01:01:20,776
JUST BECAUSE YOUR BREASTS ARE SMALL
你的胸很小

1133
01:01:20,778 --> 01:01:22,310
DOESN'T MEAN THEY'RE NOT LEGITIMATE.
并不意味着它们有错

1134
01:01:22,312 --> 01:01:25,247
I KNOW.
我懂

1135
01:01:25,249 --> 01:01:27,683
IT'S OKAY TO BE ANGRY.
你有理由生气
OH, MY GOD.
天哪

1136
01:01:27,685 --> 01:01:30,052
LET'S TRY THAT ON.
先试试这个

1137
01:01:30,054 --> 01:01:32,821
YOU KNOW, IT'S LIKE I DIDN'T THINK I DESERVED A BRA,
我认为我不需要内衣是因为

1138
01:01:32,823 --> 01:01:35,390
BECAUSE I DON'T SEE MYSELF AS A REAL WOMAN.
我并没有把自己当做真正的女人看待

1139
01:01:35,392 --> 01:01:37,325
IT'S ABOUT MORE THAN JUST FABRIC.
内衣不只是一块布

1140
01:01:37,327 --> 01:01:39,695
YEAH, AND I'VE BEEN WEARING BIKINI BOTTOMS FOR MONTHS.
有一段时间我一直穿比基尼当内裤

1141
01:01:39,697 --> 01:01:41,396
WELL, THAT'S BASICALLY INVITING PEOPLE

1142
01:01:41,398 --> 01:01:43,331
WHO DON'T RESPECT YOU INTO YOUR BEDROOM.
只不过是想爬上床和你做而已

1143
01:01:43,333 --> 01:01:45,333
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I DID, AND NOW I'M LIKE SEEING HER
我经常那么做，而且我就要在周六的派对上

1144
01:01:45,335 --> 01:01:46,968
AT A PARTY ON SATURDAY,
见到她了

1145
01:01:46,970 --> 01:01:48,937
AND HOW DO I EXPECT ANYONE TO TAKE ME SERIOUSLY
如果我不穿内衣

1146
01:01:48,939 --> 01:01:50,439
IF I AM NOT WEARING A BRA?
我怎么能希望别人来认真对待我呢

1147
01:01:50,441 --> 01:01:51,840
I TAKE YOU SERIOUSLY.
我很认真对待你啊

1148
01:01:51,842 --> 01:01:53,341
THAT DOESN'T COUNT.
你不算

1149
01:02:18,367 --> 01:02:20,736
STUNNING.
很迷人

MY FRIENDS ARE MY FAMILY.
我的朋友就像我的家人

01:02:39,256 --> 01:02:41,189
YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT THAT'S LIKE,
你根本不知道那是什么感受

1153
01:02:41,191 --> 01:02:42,958
TO HAVE TO CHOOSE YOUR OWN FAMILY BECAUSE THE ONE YOU WERE BORN INTO--
你不能选择你出生在什么家庭

1154
01:02:42,960 --> 01:02:45,861
OH, COME ON, ENOUGH OF THIS LESBIAN ORPHAN PROPAGANDA.
哦省省吧，别再说这种女同孤儿院一样的东西了

1155
01:02:45,863 --> 01:02:47,462
YOU KNOW, WE'RE ALL BORN INTO SHIT FAMILIES.
我们都出生在糟糕的家庭

1156
01:02:47,464 --> 01:02:49,531
WE DEAL WITH IT.
我们都需要解决这个问题
WHAT IS YOUR PROBLEM?
你有什么毛病

MY PROBLEM IS I HAVEN'T BEEN FUCKED IN LIKE THREE WEEKS.

I AM NOT GONNA TALK ABOUT THIS ON MY BIRTHDAY.

SO YOU HAPPENED TO BE BORN. BIG FUCKING DEAL.
你碰巧出生在这一天，这天还他妈成大日子了

1161
01:02:58,342 --> 01:03:00,408
OH, I'M SORRY, ALL ATTENTION MUST REVOLVE AROUND YOU
哦对不起，我都忘记了，你必须得到每个人关注的焦点才罢休

1162
01:03:00,410 --> 01:03:01,977
100% OF THE TIME. I FORGOT.
每时每刻都是

1163
01:03:01,979 --> 01:03:03,945
NO, THAT'S NOT TRUE. I'M NOT LIKE THAT.
错，我才不是这样的

1164
01:03:03,947 --> 01:03:06,782
I DON'T KNOW WHY I GET SO SHOCKED WHEN YOU DO SHIT LIKE THIS.
我都不知道为什么你这样做的时候，我会这么震惊

1165
01:03:06,784 --> 01:03:08,116
YOU'RE A GROWN WOMAN IN A CREEPY,
你就是一个依赖父母的

1166
01:03:08,118 --> 01:03:09,417
CO-DEPENDENT RELATIONSHIP WITH YOUR PARENTS.
奇怪的女人而已

1167
01:03:09,419 --> 01:03:11,853
IT'S TOTALLY NORMAL, AND YOU HAVE NO IDEA
这很正常好吗，而且你根本就不懂这些

1168
01:03:11,855 --> 01:03:13,488
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT BECAUSE YOU COMPLETELY ABANDONED YOUR FAMILY.
因为你完完全全地切断了与家庭的联系

1169
01:03:13,490 --> 01:03:15,257
IT WASN'T A CHOICE!
我又没得选！

1170
01:03:15,259 --> 01:03:16,424
OF COURSE, IT'S A CHOICE!
你当然有得选了

1171
01:03:16,426 --> 01:03:18,093
SAYS THE CLOSET CASE!
那你就把你的秘密说出来啊！

1172
01:03:18,095 --> 01:03:20,061
THEY KNOW I KNOW THEY KNOW.
他们其实知道我已经知道他们意识到我是同性恋这事了

1173
01:03:20,063 --> 01:03:21,530
I'M WAITING FOR THE RIGHT TIME TO BRING IT UP,
只是出于对他们的尊敬

1174
01:03:21,532 --> 01:03:23,131
OUT OF RESPECT FOR THEM.
我在找一个合适的机会告诉他们

1175
01:03:23,133 --> 01:03:25,133
I THINK YOU AND I SEE THE WORLD TOTALLY DIFFERENTLY.
我认为我们的世界观完全不同

1176
01:03:25,135 --> 01:03:27,369
WE DO. YOU KNOW, YOU THINK THAT I'M A BAD PERSON
的确很不一样，就因为我没像你想的那样出柜

1177
01:03:27,371 --> 01:03:28,937
BECAUSE I'M NOT COMING OUT ON YOUR TERMS,
你觉得我就是个坏人

1178
01:03:28,939 --> 01:03:30,172
AND I DON'T AGREE WITH THAT.
不过我自己可没这么想

1179
01:03:30,174 --> 01:03:31,973
THAT IS NOT TRUE. I DIDN'T SAY THAT.
才不是这样，我没那么说过

1180
01:03:31,975 --> 01:03:33,575
THAT'S TOTALLY TRUE. YOU'RE NOT LISTENING TO ME.
明明就是这样，你根本不听我在说什么

1181
01:03:33,577 --> 01:03:35,177
I'M LISTENING TO YOU, AND EVERYTHING YOU'RE SAYING
我听着呢，但是你说的每句话都是错的

1182
01:03:35,179 --> 01:03:36,945
IS PISSING ME OFF AND COMPLETELY INACCURATE.
都让我觉得无比讨厌

1183
01:03:36,947 --> 01:03:38,580
YOU ARE RUINING MY BIRTHDAY.

I DON'T HAVE THE PATIENCE TO DEAL WITH YOU.
我没耐心再跟你耗下去了

1187
01:03:43,587 --> 01:03:45,320
THAT'S FINE.LET'S BREAK UP.
行啊，那就分手吧

1188
01:03:45,322 --> 01:03:48,590
FINE.
分就分

1189
01:03:48,592 --> 01:03:50,292
OKAY
好

1190
01:03:58,267 --> 01:04:01,036
IF YOU'RE GONNA GO, JUST GO. YOU DON'T GET TO TAKE THINGS.
如果你想走就走吧，有本事别拿东西

1191
01:04:02,405 --> 01:04:04,873
I GOT YOU THOSE PANTIES.
这些内裤还是我帮你买的

1192

ABSOLUTELY NOT.

01:04:14,551 --> 01:04:16,218
WHAT THE FUCK IS WRONG WITH YOU?
你他妈到底有什么毛病

1194
01:04:16,220 --> 01:04:17,319
I GOT THESE FOR YOU.
这是事给你买的

1195
01:04:17,321 --> 01:04:19,054
YOU'RE A FUCKING CRAZY PERSON!
你个疯子

1196
01:04:19,056 --> 01:04:20,255
YOU WANT TO PLAY LIKE THIS?
你真的想这么玩吗？

1197
01:04:20,257 --> 01:04:22,190
DO YOU WANT TO DO THIS? OKAY.
你非得这么搞嘛？好啊！

1198
01:04:22,192 --> 01:04:24,125
I BOUGHT ALL THE BOOZE FOR THIS PARTY.
这些酒都是我买的

1199
01:04:31,901 --> 01:04:33,602
ARE YOU HAPPY? IS THIS WHAT YOU WANTED?
你开心了吗？这就是你想要的吗？

1200
01:04:33,604 --> 01:04:36,338
YOU KNOW WHAT-- DON'T BOTHER TELLING YOUR PARENTS ABOUT US.
你知道吗，你再也不用费心怎么把我们的事告诉你父母了

I KNOW YOU, AND THE MORE THAT I THINK ABOUT IT,
我很了解你，我越来越觉得

1202
01:04:38,642 --> 01:04:40,141
THIS IS PROBABLY JUST A PHASE.
这可能只是阶段性的而已

1203
01:04:44,213 --> 01:04:47,916
GOD, THIS WAS SUCH A WASTE.
天啊，我浪费在你身上太多时间了

1204
01:05:20,182 --> 01:05:21,483
