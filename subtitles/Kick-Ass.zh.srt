1
00:00:05,605 --> 00:00:09,336
宇宙守护神  保护我们远离邪恶
Guardian of the universe protecting us against the forces of evil.

2
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:12,712
他能徒手抓住子弹  拦住疾速的火车
He can catch a bullet. halt a speeding train.

3
00:00:12,712 --> 00:00:15,181
轻轻一跳就能飞跃高楼
And leap tall buildings in a single bound.

4
00:00:15,181 --> 00:00:17,550
-在天上  -是鸟  还是飞机
- up in the sky! - is it a bird? is it a plane?

5
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:20,687
白天只是一名邮差  晚上却化身超级英雄
A mailman by day. the city's guardian by night.

6
00:00:20,687 --> 00:00:23,656
保卫纽约市民免受邪恶滋扰
Defending the citizens of New York from the forces of evil.

7
00:00:23,656 --> 00:00:26,860
一群超乎常人的英雄们
The world has been protected by a group of extraordinary men and women...

8
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:29,129
致力于与犯罪作斗争  保护这个世界
...who have dedicated themselves to fighting crime.

9
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:31,131
另一个世界的神秘来客
Mysterious traveller from another dimension.

10
00:00:31,131 --> 00:00:35,568
他的力量远远超出了人类
He has powers far beyond the capabilities of mere earthlings.

11
00:00:46,312 --> 00:00:48,872
我总是奇怪  为什么在我之前没人尝试过
I always wondered why nobody did it before me.

12
00:00:51,451 --> 00:00:55,114
想想看  在那些漫画  电影  电视剧里
I mean, all those comic books, movies, tvshows.

13
00:00:55,255 --> 00:00:58,383
你以为只有真正怪癖宅人才会给自己做一身超人装
You'd think that one eccentric loner would have made himself a costume.

14
00:01:01,194 --> 00:01:04,061
我是说  日常生活真这么激动人心吗  
I mean, is everyday life really so exciting?

15
00:01:04,364 --> 00:01:06,266
学校和公司生活真这么惊心动魄
Are schools and offices so thrilling...

16
00:01:06,266 --> 00:01:09,064
以至于只有我才去幻想这些吗
...that I'm the only one who ever fantasized about this?

17
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,834
得了吧  坦白说
Come on, be honest with yourself.

18
00:01:13,406 --> 00:01:17,365
每个人心中  都想成为一个超级英雄
At some point in our lives we all wanted to be a superhero.

19
00:01:33,293 --> 00:01:35,420
顺便  这可不是我
That's not me, by the way.

20
00:01:35,662 --> 00:01:39,462
而是某个有精神病的亚美尼亚人
That's some Armenian guy with a history of mental health problems.

21
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:41,525
我是何人
Who am I?

22
00:01:42,235 --> 00:01:43,930
我是"海扁王"
I'm Kick-Ass.

23
00:01:47,930 --> 00:01:49,930
六个月前

24
00:01:53,646 --> 00:01:57,673
这才是我  当时这些破事还没发生
That's me... back before any of this crazy shit happened.

25
00:01:58,585 --> 00:02:02,077
我大概是那种最不像超级英雄的人了
I guess I was the last person you'd expect to become a superhero.

26
00:02:03,356 --> 00:02:06,086
不是说我有什么不正常
I'm not saying there was anything wrong with me...

27
00:02:06,226 --> 00:02:08,251
而是再正常不过了
...but there's nothing special, either.

28
00:02:09,129 --> 00:02:11,154
-混球  -我体育不好
- asshole! - I wasn't into sports.

29
00:02:11,264 --> 00:02:14,392
数学不好  也不擅长打游戏
I wasn't a mathlete or a hard core gamer.

30
00:02:14,767 --> 00:02:18,302
我身上没穿过环  也没厌食症
I didn't have a piercing or an eating disorder,

31
00:02:18,302 --> 00:02:19,966
Space上好友也不多
or 3000 friends on myspace.

32
00:02:20,373 --> 00:02:24,173
我唯一的超能力就是能让女生们忽视我
My only superpower was being invisible to girls.

33
00:02:24,677 --> 00:02:28,238
就算在朋友里  我也不是最会搞笑的
And out of my friends, man, I wasn't even the funny one.

34
00:02:28,715 --> 00:02:31,878
和大多数我的同龄人一样  我再普通不过了
Like most people my age, I just existed.

35
00:02:42,729 --> 00:02:44,196
同学们  早上好
Good morning, class.

36
00:02:44,297 --> 00:02:48,097
请打开书本  翻到第二幕  第二场
Please open your books to act two, scene two.

37
00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:52,269
要是你闯进我卧室  多半会发现我在看电视
Kick in my bedroom door and you'll probably find me watching tv...

38
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:54,774
要不就是在Skype上跟我朋友陶德聊天
...or talking to my friend todd on skype.

39
00:02:54,774 --> 00:02:57,208
-你看《恶搞之家》吗  -不看
- You watching 'family guy'? - No.

40
00:02:57,343 --> 00:03:01,404
我也不看  去看巨乳网  很赞的
Me neither. turn on nippleslip. com. it's good.

41
00:03:04,651 --> 00:03:07,848
要不就是在打手枪  通常是意淫我的英文老师
Or jerking off, mostly to my english teacher.

42
00:03:09,189 --> 00:03:14,456
戴夫·莱泽斯基  别以为我没发现你盯着我的胸看
Dave Lizewski. don't think I haven't noticed you looking at my tits.

43
00:03:15,662 --> 00:03:20,099
来吧  戴夫  快来爱抚我吧
Oh, I want your hands all over me, Dave. please.

44
00:03:21,668 --> 00:03:24,304
当然  平凡无奇的学校日子
Sure, a lot of what got me through the average school day...

45
00:03:24,304 --> 00:03:27,705
只有靠打打灰机来打发
...was making deposits in the whac koff warehouse for later.

46
00:03:27,807 --> 00:03:31,641
但说实话  我的兴奋点比较低
Though, to be honest, it didn't take much to set me off.

47
00:03:32,912 --> 00:03:35,682
我发誓  一旦我的荷尔蒙恢复正常
I swear, when my hormones balance out...

48
00:03:35,682 --> 00:03:38,412
就用不着耗费这么多纸巾了  伙计
...shares in kleenex are gonna take a dive, man.

49
00:03:42,188 --> 00:03:45,954
戴夫·莱泽斯基  专心看你的《哈姆雷特》
Dave Lizewski. shouldn't you be looking at 'Hamlet' right now?

50
00:03:46,059 --> 00:03:47,526
好的  赞恩女士
Yes, mrs Zane.

51
00:03:49,696 --> 00:03:50,822
抱歉
Sorry.

52
00:03:52,332 --> 00:03:55,733
别误会  我也喜欢同龄女生
But don't get me wrong. I like girls my own age, too.

53
00:03:56,536 --> 00:03:59,528
-特别是凯蒂·多玛  -你好  美人儿
- Especially Katie Deauxma. - Hey, gorgeous.

54
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,332
你好
Hey.

55
00:04:04,811 --> 00:04:06,438
哦不
Oh... no.

56
00:04:07,213 --> 00:04:09,238
你是指艾丽卡吧
You meant Erika.

57
00:04:09,749 --> 00:04:13,048
我知道  我只是在开玩笑
I know. I knew that. I was just kidding.

58
00:04:13,686 --> 00:04:15,415
好吧  不好笑
Okay, cool.

59
00:04:16,122 --> 00:04:17,282
我的天
Oh my god.

60
00:04:21,427 --> 00:04:23,395
看  这是陶德的老妈
Hey, look, I'm Todd's mom.

61
00:04:26,132 --> 00:04:28,066
真好笑  这是你老爸
That's funny. this is your dad.

62
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:30,535
不  那还是我妈
No, that's still my mom, actually.

63
00:04:32,939 --> 00:04:34,304
我操
Oh, the fuck!

64
00:04:34,741 --> 00:04:36,743
我只是个普通人
I was just a regular guy.

65
00:04:36,743 --> 00:04:41,848
没被蜘蛛咬过  也不是流亡地球的外星人[蜘蛛侠和超人]
No radioactive spiders, no refugee status from a doomed alien world.

66
00:04:41,848 --> 00:04:44,984
陶德说"巧古拉伯爵"[一种麦片]还没停产
You know what? Todd said they do still make count Chocula.

67
00:04:44,984 --> 00:04:47,077
只是超市里不卖了而已
They just don't sell it at the store any more.

68
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:52,153
我老妈得了动脉瘤  死在了厨房里
My mother was killed by an aneurism in the kitchen.

69
00:04:52,325 --> 00:04:54,694
而不是在小巷子里被人枪杀[蝙蝠侠]
As opposed to a gunman in the alley.

70
00:04:54,694 --> 00:04:55,895
所以要是你指望有以下的桥段
So if you were hoping for any...

71
00:04:55,895 --> 00:04:59,198
我会为你报仇  母亲大人
I will avenge you, mother!

72
00:04:59,198 --> 00:05:00,667
你会失望的
...you're out of luck.

73
00:05:00,667 --> 00:05:02,835
我妈去世十八个月之后
In the 18 months since my mother died...

74
00:05:02,835 --> 00:05:06,532
我唯一的顿悟就是  生活还得继续
...the only epiphany I had was realising that life just goes on.

75
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:08,834
包装上的蜜蜂形象变了吗
Did they change the bee's face?

76
00:05:09,842 --> 00:05:10,968
没有
No.

77
00:05:19,018 --> 00:05:21,854
怎么从来没人试着做个超级英雄
How come nobody's ever tried to be a superhero?

78
00:05:21,854 --> 00:05:25,124
我不知道  大概是因为根本不可能吧  笨蛋
Boy, I dunno. probably because it's fucking impossible, dipshit.

79
00:05:25,124 --> 00:05:28,328
戴上面具  助人为乐  这有什么不可能
What, putting on a mask and helping people, how's that impossible?

80
00:05:28,328 --> 00:05:29,962
那又不算是超级英雄
That's not superhero, though.

81
00:05:29,962 --> 00:05:33,231
所谓超级  就要上天入地  比其他人都强
Super's like being stronger than everybody and flying and shit.

82
00:05:33,231 --> 00:05:34,233
你那最多只是英雄
That's just hero.

83
00:05:34,233 --> 00:05:37,430
不  连英雄都不算  只能算是疯子
No, it's not even hero. it's just fucking psycho.

84
00:05:37,637 --> 00:05:40,807
那蝙蝠侠呢  他又没超能力
Hello? Bruce Wayne? he didn't have any powers.

85
00:05:40,807 --> 00:05:43,242
对  但他有一身根本造不出来的牛逼装备
Yes, but he had all the expensive shit that doesn't exist.

86
00:05:43,242 --> 00:05:45,545
你是问现实生活  现实生活中没有这套
I thought you meant how come nobody does it in real life?

87
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:47,180
没错  陶德  我就是这个意思
Yeah, Todd, that's what I meant.

88
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:49,682
老兄  要是现实生活中真有人这么做  不被海扁才怪
Dude, if anybody did it in real life they'd get their ass kicked.

89
00:05:49,682 --> 00:05:51,784
-估计撑不过一天就挂了  -没错
- They'd be dead in, like, a day. - A day.

90
00:05:51,784 --> 00:05:53,686
好吧  我不是说要有人这么做
Yeah, okay, I'm not saying they should do it.

91
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:55,984
我只是很费解  为什么没人尝试
I just can't figure out why nobody does.

92
00:05:56,055 --> 00:05:59,659
说真的  有那么多人喜欢超级英雄
Seriously, out of all the millions of people who love superheroes,

93
00:05:59,659 --> 00:06:01,923
难道就没人想去尝试吗
You'd think one would give it a try.

94
00:06:02,829 --> 00:06:04,997
天啊  难道你们不困惑吗
Jesus, guys, does it not bug you?

95
00:06:04,997 --> 00:06:06,522
为什么成千上万的人挖空心思
Why thousands of people wanna be Paris

96
00:06:06,522 --> 00:06:08,167
想成为帕丽斯·希尔顿  却没人想当蜘蛛侠
Hilton and nobody wants to be spiderman?

97
00:06:08,167 --> 00:06:11,170
对呀  为啥呢  她的胸那么小  跟没有一样
Yeah, what's with that? she has, like, no tits at all.

98
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:13,706
估计是因为她的性爱自拍吧  蜘蛛侠没拍过
Maybe it's a porn tape. he doesn't have a porn tape.

99
00:06:13,706 --> 00:06:15,731
你们难道没看过《与蜘蛛侠的一夜风流》[A片]
You guys never saw 'One Night in Spiderman'?

100
00:06:18,144 --> 00:06:19,509
猜猜谁来了
Oooh, guess who?

101
00:06:23,516 --> 00:06:27,008
你们谁跟我一样  觉得克里斯·达米科很可怜
Is it me or do you kinda feel sorry for chris D'Amico?

102
00:06:27,186 --> 00:06:30,056
老爸那么有钱  永远要啥有啥  真是糟透了
Must be terrible to have a rich dad and everything you want.

103
00:06:30,056 --> 00:06:31,575
真希望你啥都没说
I wish you wouldn't have said anything

104
00:06:31,575 --> 00:06:33,253
我都要哭出来了
Cos I feel like I'm gonna start crying...

105
00:06:33,593 --> 00:06:36,721
事实上  他总是独来独往
The fact that he's always on his own.

106
00:06:37,997 --> 00:06:40,600
我们应该跟他聊聊
We should, like, talk to him.

107
00:06:40,600 --> 00:06:42,235
看看他愿不愿意跟我们一块玩
See if he wants to hang out with us.

108
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:44,036
我不是说就去搭个讪而已
Oh, I didn't say we should talk to him, I just...

109
00:06:44,036 --> 00:06:45,605
想想看  有他这样的朋友该多牛逼
Think about it. come on, it'd be awesome.

110
00:06:45,605 --> 00:06:48,631
看谁还敢来找我们的麻烦
If he was our friend, no one would ever fuck with us again.

111
00:06:48,741 --> 00:06:49,742
那你去吧  陶德
Go on then, Todd.

112
00:06:49,742 --> 00:06:51,110
-你想和他聊聊吗  -不不不
- You wanna go talk to him? - No, no, no. no.

113
00:06:51,110 --> 00:06:52,278
为什么  你想和他聊  我可以让个位置
No, you wanna go talk to him? I can move.

114
00:06:52,278 --> 00:06:54,838
-应该让戴夫去  -对  应该让戴夫去
- Dave, Dave should go. - Dave should go.

115
00:06:55,214 --> 00:06:57,409
-为什么  -戴夫  是该让你去
- Why? - Dave, you should totally go.

116
00:06:57,483 --> 00:06:59,218
-损友  -不要怕  戴夫
- You're a dick. - Don't be afraid, dave.

117
00:06:59,218 --> 00:07:00,480
你们真怂
You're a pussy.

118
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,359
滚开
Fuck off!

119
00:07:15,101 --> 00:07:18,798
-你刚才是不是吓死了  -我都快尿裤子了
- Did you spray anything over there? - I think I might have shat my pants.

120
00:07:22,608 --> 00:07:24,944
要是换了我  肯定海扁他一顿
If that guy spoke to me like that I would have kicked his ass.

121
00:07:24,944 --> 00:07:27,013
算了吧  你什么时候跟人动过手
Todd, when have you ever kicked anyone's ass?

122
00:07:27,013 --> 00:07:29,413
不管怎样  我可以偷袭他膝盖
Whatever, man. I would have just gone for his knees.

123
00:07:29,482 --> 00:07:30,817
你说得没道理
Well, you're not making sense.

124
00:07:30,817 --> 00:07:33,186
我是说蝙蝠镖的强大威力
Well, what I'm saying is the superior force of batman's batarang

125
00:07:33,186 --> 00:07:35,221
肯定能穿透小丑的动力场
would undoubtedly penetrate the joker's force field,

126
00:07:35,221 --> 00:07:36,656
这样他就完全无力抵抗...
Leaving him totally vulnerable to the...

127
00:07:36,656 --> 00:07:39,750
-好吧  但是...  -那俩娘娘腔又来了
- All right, and then... but, you know... - Whoa, whoa, whoa pussy patrol.

128
00:07:39,859 --> 00:07:41,360
手机  钱  交出来
Phones. Money.

129
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:43,089
不是吧  大哥  又来
Dude, not again, come on.

130
00:07:44,997 --> 00:07:45,865
还有手机
Phone.

131
00:07:45,865 --> 00:07:48,095
我没手机  上星期被人抢了
I don't have one someone else jacked it last week.

132
00:07:48,201 --> 00:07:50,703
-废物  -袋子给我
- Pussy. - Give me the bag.

133
00:07:50,703 --> 00:07:53,866
-里面都是漫画书  -少废话  想挨刀子吗
- It's just comics. - Yo, you wanna get cut?

134
00:08:04,250 --> 00:08:06,980
你瞧这混蛋  就那么干看着
Look at this asshole just watching.

135
00:08:10,957 --> 00:08:14,120
得了吧  说实话
Come on, be honest with yourself.

136
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:16,992
要是你  你又能怎样
Would you do anything differently?

137
00:08:18,798 --> 00:08:21,858
当你看见别人陷于危难  你想要伸出援手
We see someone in trouble and we wish we could help,

138
00:08:22,034 --> 00:08:23,262
可你就是做不到
But we don't.

139
00:08:27,907 --> 00:08:31,968
在我生活的这个世界  英雄只存在于漫画里

要是坏蛋也一样  那其实也没什么
I guess that would have been okay if bad guys were make-believe, too.

142
00:08:38,584 --> 00:08:39,949
可是坏蛋不一样
But they're not.

143

阿弗  我发誓我没胡编
Frankie, I'm telling you, man, I swear I'm not making this up.

00:08:44,557 --> 00:08:47,627
那个王八蛋  不知道从哪儿冒出来
This fucking guy comes out of nowhere.

你说了  崔  你说那家伙像蝙蝠侠
You did Tre, you said the guy looked like batman.

00:08:57,970 --> 00:09:00,039
-他说对方带了面具啥的  -还有斗篷
- He said like a mask and stuff. - And a cape.

150
00:09:00,039 --> 00:09:01,040
那就是蝙蝠侠嘛
Yeah, like batman.

151
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,943
我没说像蝙蝠侠  我压根没提过蝙蝠侠
I didn't say "like batman". I never said "batman".

152
00:09:03,943 --> 00:09:05,069
好吧
Okay.

153
00:09:06,078 --> 00:09:08,638
我来告诉你问题出在哪  崔
Let me tell you the problem I got with that, Tre.

154
00:09:09,081 --> 00:09:13,211
我们在俄国佬那边的卧底说法有点不一样
Our mole with the Russians tells things a little different.

155
00:09:13,753 --> 00:09:18,324
据他所说  是你卖了我的毒品还私吞了这笔钱
According to him, you sold him my coke and you took the money.

156
00:09:18,324 --> 00:09:20,451
那是他妈的胡扯
That's a fucking lie!

157
00:09:20,526 --> 00:09:24,464
难以置信  你居然相信俄国佬胡扯的屁话
I can't believe that you would believe this shit from a fucking Russian,

158
00:09:24,464 --> 00:09:24,797
伙计
Man!

159
00:09:24,797 --> 00:09:27,561
崔  咱倒是分析下  哪种说法更可信
Let me see, Tre, what's more likely, huh?

160
00:09:28,034 --> 00:09:29,870
要么是你这个利欲熏心的小王八蛋
That you're a greedy little

161
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:33,339
要么是超人大驾光临抢走了我的毒品
Cock-sucker or all my coke was stolen by superman?

162
00:09:33,339 --> 00:09:35,074
-是蝙蝠侠  -我没说是蝙蝠侠
- Batman. - I never said batman!

163
00:09:35,074 --> 00:09:36,371
够了
Enough!

164
00:09:39,579 --> 00:09:44,881
我儿子还在等我带他去看电影  我不想扫他兴
My son is waiting to go to the movies and I ain't gonna disappoint him.

165
00:09:45,618 --> 00:09:47,518
乔  这事你看着办
Joe, you're in charge.

166
00:09:48,354 --> 00:09:51,755
这是我这辈子听过最烂的借口  崔
That's gotta be the worst fucking excuse I ever heard, Tre.

167
00:09:59,231 --> 00:10:02,368
-抱歉让你久等了  儿子  -电影再过十分钟就要开场了
- Sorry you had to wait, buddy. - the movie is starting in 10 minutes.

168
00:10:02,368 --> 00:10:04,131
这有什么
It's okay, we're cool.

169
00:10:04,236 --> 00:10:05,820
大不了错过预告片
We're only gonna miss the trailers.

170
00:10:05,820 --> 00:10:07,535
对  可是我还想买点爆米花
Yeah, but I wanna get some popcorn.

171
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,666
到了之后给克里斯买点爆米花  知道吗
When we get in there, get chris some popcorn. okay?

172
00:10:11,911 --> 00:10:12,645
想喝点什么
What d'you wanna drink?

00:10:12,645 --> 00:10:14,180
-百事可乐吗  -行
- You want a pepsi? - Yeah, that's fine.

174
00:10:14,180 --> 00:10:17,343
给他买罐百事可乐  我来杯思乐冰  混合口味的
Get him a pepsi and I'll have an icee. mixed.

175
00:10:18,751 --> 00:10:20,776
就是那种红加蓝的[樱桃加蓝莓]
Like when they mix the red one and the blue one.

176
00:10:22,655 --> 00:10:23,986
再来包扭扭糖
And a pack of twizzlers.

177
00:10:46,078 --> 00:10:47,841
漫画书里说得不对
The comic books had it wrong.

178
00:10:48,547 --> 00:10:50,775
想成为超级英雄并不需要经历创伤
It didn't take a trauma or cosmic

179
00:10:50,775 --> 00:10:53,610
宇宙射线或者能量戒指
rays or a power ring to make a superhero.

180
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:58,756
只需要一点点乐观  再加一点点天真
Just the perfect combination of optimism and naivety.

181
00:11:32,725 --> 00:11:35,421
你帅毙了
You are fucking awesome.

182
00:11:37,997 --> 00:11:39,931
来吧  放马过来
Come on then, bring it on!

183
00:11:57,931 --> 00:11:59,931
与此同时

184
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:10,285
-爸爸  我害怕  -来吧  敏蒂  宝贝儿
- Daddy, I'm scared. - come on, mindy. honey.

你都这么大了  没什么好怕的
Be a big girl now. there's nothing to be afraid of.

186
00:12:13,632 --> 00:12:16,533
-会很痛吗  -孩子
- Is it gonna hurt bad? - Oh, child.

187
00:12:16,736 --> 00:12:18,499
一下子就好了  小宝贝
Only for a second, sugar.

188
00:12:18,704 --> 00:12:21,874
手枪子弹的速度会超过
A handgun bullet travels at more than...

189
00:12:21,874 --> 00:12:24,410
-每小时七百码  -对
- 700 miles an hour. - 700 miles an hour.

190
00:12:24,410 --> 00:12:25,963
所以在这样的距离
So at close range, like this,

191
00:12:25,963 --> 00:12:29,014
冲力肯定会让你腾空而起
The force is gonna take you off your feet for sure...

192
00:12:29,014 --> 00:12:32,040
但是不会比当胸一拳更疼
...but it's really no more painful than a punch in the chest.

193
00:12:32,151 --> 00:12:34,051
我讨厌被当胸一拳
I hate getting punched in the chest.

194
00:12:34,787 --> 00:12:36,516
你会没事的  小宝贝
You're gonna be fine, baby doll.

195
00:12:44,663 --> 00:12:47,223
感觉如何  也不是很疼吧
How was that? not so bad.

196
00:12:47,433 --> 00:12:50,664
挺好玩的吧  现在你知道这种感觉了
Kinda fun, huh? now you know how it feels.

197
00:12:50,770 --> 00:12:54,173
下回你再见到有人掏出一把格洛克  就不会害怕了
You won't be scared when some junkie asshole pulls a glock.

198
00:12:54,173 --> 00:12:57,143
-我什么时候怕过  -这才是我的宝贝女儿
- I wouldn't have been scared anyways. - That's my girl.

199
00:12:57,143 --> 00:12:58,978
好了  起来吧
All right, up you get. come on.

200
00:12:58,978 --> 00:13:01,580
再来两回  我们就回家
Two more rounds and then home.

201
00:13:01,580 --> 00:13:03,480
-还来啊  -对啊
- Again? - Uh-huh.

202
00:13:04,016 --> 00:13:06,849
那回去的时候得带我去保龄球馆
Only if we can go by the bowling alley on the way back.

203
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:11,513
-保龄球馆  -对  然后再来点冰淇淋
- The bowling alley? - Yeah. and ice-cream after.

204
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:17,589
行  再来两轮  不准躲不准叫
Okay. two more rounds. no wincing...

205
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:21,600
咱们就成交  小家伙

206
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,370
我要份奶油巧克力圣代
Yeah! I'm gonna get a hot fudge sundae.

207
00:13:24,370 --> 00:13:26,361
好品位  宝贝儿
Good call, baby doll.

208
00:13:29,675 --> 00:13:33,634
你还想要点什么生日礼物
So, have you thought about what you might want for your birthday?

209
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:35,474
我能要只小狗吗
Can I get a puppy?

210
00:13:36,916 --> 00:13:40,079
-你想要只狗吗  -对  毛茸茸的那种
- You wanna get a dog? - Yeah, a cuddly fluffy one.

211
00:13:40,152 --> 00:13:42,916
再要个影星版的街头美少女莎雪娃娃
And a bratz moviestar makeover sasha.

212
00:13:47,993 --> 00:13:49,728
我耍你的  老爸
I'm just fucking with you, daddy.

213
00:13:49,728 --> 00:13:53,095
我想要把蝴蝶牌的四十二型蝴蝶刀
Look, I'll have a benchmade model-42 butterfly knife.

214
00:13:53,399 --> 00:13:56,926
宝贝儿  你总是吓我一跳
Oh, child. you always knock me for a loop.

215
00:13:57,269 --> 00:13:58,537
-你猜怎着  -怎么
- You know what? - What?

216
00:13:58,537 --> 00:14:00,639
-我给你买两把  -真的
- I'm gonna get you two. - Two?

217
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:03,904
两把蝴蝶刀  全都给你
One balisong. two balisong. that's what you get.

218
00:14:22,595 --> 00:14:25,464
[出自哈姆雷特]风流的宝镜  人伦的雅范
The glass of fashion and the mould of form.

219
00:14:25,464 --> 00:14:29,401
-举世注目的中心  -安静
- The observed of all observers, - Quite, quite down!

220
00:14:29,401 --> 00:14:32,131
这样无可挽回地殒落
And I, of ladies most deject and wretched...

221
00:14:38,477 --> 00:14:39,678
说句老实话
I'll be honest,

222
00:14:39,678 --> 00:14:43,205
刚开始那几周我打击罪犯的机会并不多
There wasn't a whole lot of crime-fighting in those first few weeks.

223
00:14:43,782 --> 00:14:47,149
即便如此  我的新生活也够忙的
But even so, my new vocation kept me plenty busy.

224
00:14:52,491 --> 00:14:53,459
见鬼
Shit.

225
00:14:53,459 --> 00:14:54,983
我管这叫预备期
I called it preparation.

226
00:14:59,131 --> 00:15:02,828
但你要说我这是在做白日梦  我也没法反驳
But if you called it fantasizing, it would have been hard to argue.

227
00:15:03,802 --> 00:15:07,636
我只知道  我的自我感觉从没有这么好过
All I knew was I'd never felt so good about myself.

228
00:15:24,356 --> 00:15:25,345
操
Fuck!

229
00:15:26,725 --> 00:15:29,785
好吧  大概我还处于基础调试期
Okay, maybe I was still in the beta testing phase.

230
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:31,660
但这仅仅是个开始
But it was a start.

231
00:15:49,014 --> 00:15:51,346
你他妈看什么呢
What the fuck are you looking at?

232
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:54,484
-没什么  -快他妈给我滚
- Nothing. - Get the fuck out of here!

233
00:15:59,124 --> 00:16:01,293
每个连环杀手都明白
Like every serial killer already knew,

234
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:04,194
总有一天幻想将无法再满足你的需要
Eventually fantasizing just doesn't do it for you any more.

235
00:16:05,331 --> 00:16:06,992
是时候付诸行动了
It was time to engage.

236
00:16:09,568 --> 00:16:10,500
快点  伙计
Hurry up, man.

237
00:16:13,772 --> 00:16:15,433
我操  这搞什么
What the fuck...?

238
00:16:24,383 --> 00:16:26,146
你他妈看什么呢
The fuck you looking at?

239
00:16:26,952 --> 00:16:29,512
我问你  你他妈看什么呢
I said what the fuck are you looking at?

240
00:16:34,493 --> 00:16:36,996
两个垃圾人渣在撬一辆汽车
Two cheap shit losers screwing with a car...

241
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:40,159
要知道那可是人家拼死拼活挣来的
...that someone probably worked their ass off to pay for.

242
00:16:40,966 --> 00:16:44,060
-你说啥  -别管他了  伙计
- Say what? - Leave it be, man.

243
00:16:44,903 --> 00:16:47,269
这傻逼肯定是磕多了
This motherfucker's obviously high.

244
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,060
我没嗑药
I'm not high.

245
00:16:49,060 --> 00:16:52,902
我只是觉得你们不能为所欲为
I just think it sucks you guys think you can do what you want.

246
00:16:53,912 --> 00:16:56,710
远离那辆车  我就当这事没发生过
Just walk away from the car and we can forget about this.

247
00:16:59,518 --> 00:17:01,486
你疯了吧  哥们
You're crazy, man.

248
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:02,676
打死丫的
Fuck this shit.

249
00:17:16,835 --> 00:17:18,359
-操  -快跑
- Shit. - Let's get out of here.

250
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:02,839
我求了医生半天 
I came round long enough to beg the

251
00:18:02,839 --> 00:18:05,316
让他别跟其他人说我的装扮
Medic not to tell anybody about the costume.

252
00:18:06,051 --> 00:18:07,518
他答应了
He promised he wouldn't.

253
00:18:09,388 --> 00:18:12,380
我只知道我老爸一定会杀了我
All I knew was my dad was gonna kill me.

254
00:18:27,272 --> 00:18:30,109
为什么我没枪  我是保安啊
Why can't I have a gun? I'm a security guard.

255
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:32,578
你现在就是个看门的  不会再有枪了
You're a doorman now. you don't get a gun no more.

256
00:18:32,578 --> 00:18:34,113
我看起来真衰
I look like a putz.

257
00:18:34,113 --> 00:18:38,174
挺好的  看这钮扣多帅  干你该干的  快他妈开门
You look sharp. all them buttons. do your job, open the fucking door.

258
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:42,045
祝您愉快
Have a nice day.

是件大事  弗兰克
It's a big thing, Frank.

266
00:19:29,902 --> 00:19:30,926

-克里斯  你要去干嘛  -我要跟老爸谈一下
- Chris, where do you think you're going? - I gotta talk to dad.

269
00:19:42,514 --> 00:19:43,674
克里斯多夫
Christopher.

270
00:19:43,815 --> 00:19:45,112
亲爱的  弗兰克
Frank, honey.

271
00:19:47,753 --> 00:19:49,354
你跟着来干嘛
Where do you think you're going?

272
00:19:49,354 --> 00:19:53,392
爸  我不介意你在我面前谈生意  我可以就这么听着
I don't mind you talking business. I was just gonna sit quietly.

273
00:19:53,392 --> 00:19:55,986
我也该开始学点东西了
I should probably start learning this stuff anyway.

274
00:19:56,094 --> 00:19:57,829
回去吃你的饭
Hey, go finish your oatmeal.

275
00:19:57,829 --> 00:20:01,663
该死  我还有八个月就成年了
God-dammit, I'm gonna be 18 in 8 months, for christ sakes.

276
00:20:04,836 --> 00:20:05,928
坐下来吧
Take a seat.

277
00:20:09,241 --> 00:20:10,309
出什么事了
So what's the problem?

278
00:20:10,309 --> 00:20:15,042
俄罗斯佬说崔以半价又卖给他们五公斤
Our Russian says that tre just sold him another 5 k's at half price.

279
00:20:15,113 --> 00:20:18,844
-哪一个崔  就是那个崔吗  -对  死了的崔

So now I'm getting fucked in the ass by a ghost?

281
00:20:21,553 --> 00:20:23,418
不然就是崔没说谎
Or tre was telling the truth.

282
00:20:23,555 --> 00:20:28,925
啥  我沦落至此了吗  不是相信鬼就是相信超级英雄
What, this is my choice? I gotta believe in ghosts or superheroes?

283
00:20:28,994 --> 00:20:31,597
不关超级英雄的事  阿弗
Not the part about the superhero, Frankie.

284
00:20:31,597 --> 00:20:34,589
可能只是有人抢了他的货
Just that he might have really been gaffled by somebody.

The point is some fucker is killing our guys.

306
00:22:08,727 --> 00:22:10,262

In the ambulance they threw my clothes away because of the blood.

The doctors fixed me up pretty good.

363
00:24:58,997 --> 00:25:00,665
-痛吗  -不痛

364
00:25:00,665 --> 00:25:03,725
你就像杰森·伯恩一样[谍影重重主角]  酷

就被你们搞得想回医院去了

00:26:16,675 --> 00:26:19,578
好吧  这绝不是你想象的那样
Yeah. you know, I really don't think that's what it looks like.

387
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:22,213
-你说什么  -问题是
- What are you talking about? - The point is...

388
00:26:22,213 --> 00:26:24,681
凯蒂只是同情弱势群体
...Katie's all about the lame ducks.

389
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:26,618
这和我有什么关系
What's this got to do with me?

390
00:26:26,618 --> 00:26:29,018
我在想怎么告诉你好
I've been trying to figure out how to tell you this.

391
00:26:30,055 --> 00:26:32,390
-最近学校里有流言说  -对
- There's a rumour going around... - Right.

392
00:26:32,390 --> 00:26:33,825
-说你是...  -啥
- ...that you... - What?

393
00:26:33,825 --> 00:26:35,656
-同性恋  -啥?!
- ...are gay. - Gay?!

394
00:26:35,961 --> 00:26:38,930
-怎么会有这种流言  -你被抢劫了

00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:41,366
-你们都被抢劫过啊  -对  但是...
- You guys have been mugged. - I know, but...

396
00:26:41,366 --> 00:26:44,035
你被狂扁一顿  还被扒光衣服
...we didn't get beat up and have all our clothes taken off.

397
00:26:44,035 --> 00:26:47,061
才不是那样  是医护人员把我的衣服脱掉的
It's not even true. the medic threw my clothes away.

398
00:26:48,340 --> 00:26:50,175
别在意了  只是流言而已
Don't worry about it. rumours don't mean shit.

399
00:26:50,175 --> 00:26:51,042
我们知道你不是的
We know the truth.

400
00:26:51,042 --> 00:26:51,643
对吧
Right?

401
00:26:51,643 --> 00:26:52,377

00:26:52,377 --> 00:26:54,746
谁知道呢  搞不好你能把她搞定
Who knows, this might even get you laid.

403
00:26:54,746 --> 00:26:57,909
她如果以为他是基佬就没戏  陶德  你个白痴
No, not if she thinks he's gay, Todd. you fucking retard.

404
00:26:58,483 --> 00:27:01,043
-多谢你泼冷水  小马  -我只是实话实说
- That's really fucking helping me! - I'm just being honest.

405
00:27:04,856 --> 00:27:07,188
我又回到了老样子
I was getting back to my old self.

406
00:27:07,525 --> 00:27:09,459
也许我应该放弃
I should have quit, of course...

407
00:27:09,728 --> 00:27:12,060
但人不能说重来就重来
...but you can't just re-programme yourself...

408
00:27:12,364 --> 00:27:15,765
你是谁  想要什么  人生目标
...what you want, who you are, your purpose in life.

409
00:27:16,101 --> 00:27:18,535
不  我只是路过
No, I'm just standing around.

410
00:27:19,004 --> 00:27:20,096
才不是
No, I'm not!

411
00:27:20,705 --> 00:27:23,037
-就是这样而已  -尝到厉害了吧
- It is what it is. - How about that, huh?

412
00:27:25,443 --> 00:27:28,279
你怕了吧
Oh, yeah. didn't see that, did you?

413
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:30,215
你最好赶快滚蛋
Think it's best that you just walk away.

414
00:27:30,215 --> 00:27:31,683
你最好别这么干
Well maybe you shouldn't do that.

415
00:27:31,683 --> 00:27:32,651
啥
What? huh?

416
00:27:32,651 --> 00:27:33,585
你看什么看
Are you looking at me?

417
00:27:33,585 --> 00:27:35,212
这事我管定了
Well, this is my business.

418
00:27:41,212 --> 00:27:43,212
我是海扁王  打击罪恶的蒙面英雄

419
00:27:46,698 --> 00:27:49,895
我吗  我已经重生
Me? my hardware was fixed now.

天  哥们  不好意思
Oh, god, I'm so sorry, man.

434

435
00:29:23,595 --> 00:29:24,562
多谢  怪胎
Thanks, freak.

436
00:29:27,599 --> 00:29:30,659
-放开他  -滚开  关你屁事
- Leave him alone. - Fuck off, it's none of your business.

437
00:29:33,905 --> 00:29:35,031
管定了
Yes it is.

438
00:30:03,434 --> 00:30:05,231
快报警
Hey, call 911!

Hey, there's a dude dressed like a superhero fighting a bunch of guys.

441
00:30:48,713 --> 00:30:49,771
放开他
Leave him alone!

442
00:30:56,487 --> 00:30:59,047
放弃吧  赶快滚蛋
Give it up, man. just walk away.

443
00:31:00,058 --> 00:31:01,320
绝不
No, never.

444
00:31:02,794 --> 00:31:06,559
你他妈脑子烧坏了吗  你又不认识他
What the fuck is wrong with you? you'd rather die for some piece of shit..

445
00:31:06,865 --> 00:31:09,026
你愿意为他而死吗
...that you don't even fucking know?

446
00:31:09,400 --> 00:31:13,427
你们当着那么多人三打一
You 3 assholes laying into 1 guy while everybody else watches.

447
00:31:14,272 --> 00:31:16,331
到底是谁脑子有病
And you wanna know what's wrong with me?!

448
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:22,779
没错  我宁愿死  放马过来

老兄  你一定要看看这个
Dude, you gotta check this shit out.

456
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:57,779

我的Space上只有38个好友

Kick Ass's myspace...16,000 and counting.

469
00:32:36,754 --> 00:32:40,349
实在太疯狂了  我就爱这种感觉
This thing was going crazy and I was loving it.

470
00:32:40,458 --> 00:32:43,995
我们迫切想知道这个人到底是谁
And finally, we want to know who is this man.

471
00:32:43,995 --> 00:32:47,761
谁有任何关于这位潜水服英雄的线索
Does anyone have any idea who this wetsuit crusader is?

472
00:32:47,899 --> 00:32:50,668
他一定就在我们的身边
He must be someone's son, someone's brother,

473
00:32:50,668 --> 00:32:52,003
我们身边的普通人
Someone's next door neighbour.

474
00:32:52,003 --> 00:32:54,233

没错
Yeah!

479
00:33:08,920 --> 00:33:12,879
我爱海扁王  他的装扮太疯狂了
I like kick-ass. his costume is crappy.

480
00:33:13,091 --> 00:33:14,683
看着像个异装癖
He looks like a transvestite...

481
00:33:14,826 --> 00:33:17,158
大家都爱海扁王
You know what? everyone likes kick-ass.

482
00:33:17,962 --> 00:33:20,260
你看那视频了吗  他还真有两下子
Did you see the clip? He was actually pretty good.

483
00:33:20,398 --> 00:33:22,832
我看他被扁得真惨
Good at getting his ass kicked.

484
00:33:23,067 --> 00:33:26,059
他还不如叫挨扁王呢
He should call himself ass-kick instead.

485
00:33:26,571 --> 00:33:28,266
你真无聊
That doesn't even make sense.

486
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:32,977
我觉得这家伙一定死得很惨
That guy's gonna end up dead, that's what I think.

487
00:33:32,977 --> 00:33:35,279
真的吗  我觉得他酷毙了
Are you serious? The guy owns.

488
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:37,873
我都想发邮件让他帮我解决麻烦
I'd e-mail his site if I had a problem worth fixing.

489
00:33:37,982 --> 00:33:41,918
我有一百号人能帮你  你居然找个紧身裤男
I got 100 guys can fix a problem, you'd hire some putz in pantyhose?

490
00:33:42,720 --> 00:33:46,212
但问题是你从来不让我参与你的生意
I wouldn't wanna get in the way of your 'business' where I'm not wanted.

491
00:33:46,524 --> 00:33:50,551
我想你们猜我就是海扁王  可惜我不是
I know you have mistaken me for kick-ass, but I am not kick-ass.

492
00:33:55,551 --> 00:33:58,551
伙计  抱歉  我现在太忙了  回见
消息发送成功

493
00:34:03,551 --> 00:34:05,551
戴夫  什么时候去喝咖啡呢  凯蒂

494
00:34:09,414 --> 00:34:11,405
其实你不看漫画吧
So you don't actually read comics?

495
00:34:11,516 --> 00:34:12,617
我刚开始感兴趣
I just started.

496
00:34:12,617 --> 00:34:15,777
有人给我推荐了一些
I got recommended some like Scott Pilgrim and Shojo Beat,

497
00:34:15,777 --> 00:34:16,849
比如《歪小子斯科特》之类
That kinda thing.

498
00:34:16,954 --> 00:34:19,479
可我对超级英雄还是不太感冒
I'm not really into the whole superhero thing, though.

499
00:34:20,992 --> 00:34:24,629
我想你应该不会喜欢海扁王吧
So I guess you're not gonna line up for that new kick-ass comic, then?

500
00:34:24,629 --> 00:34:28,900
是不喜欢  但我真想过给他发邮件
I guess not. but I was seriously thinking of mailing his site.

501
00:34:28,900 --> 00:34:31,736
我是说  我真的有事想求他帮忙
I mean, I could really use some help from a guy like that right now.

502
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:34,500
是吗  什么事要他帮忙
Help? really? what with?

503
00:34:35,073 --> 00:34:37,541
你也知道我在针头交换处做义工[为防止艾滋病]
You know I volunteer at the needle exchange?

504
00:34:37,975 --> 00:34:39,343
不  我不知道
No, I didn't.

505
00:34:39,343 --> 00:34:43,214
那儿有个叫拉苏尔的人  我觉得他很可怜
Well, there's this one guy, Rasul. I felt so sorry for him and...

506
00:34:43,214 --> 00:34:46,581
知道他的抚恤金之类的事后  我就更加...
...the more I found out about his upbringing and stuff, I just...

507
00:34:49,187 --> 00:34:53,749
奇怪了  通常是我安慰别人的
Wow, that's weird. I'm usually the one playing therapist.

508
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:57,891
我能对你坦白吗
Can I make a confession?

509
00:34:58,396 --> 00:35:02,628
从很小的时候  我就一直希望能有一个
Ever since I was little I've always wanted a friend...

510
00:35:02,900 --> 00:35:04,765
像你这样的朋友
...like you.

511
00:35:05,403 --> 00:35:08,930
这样说行吗  其实我不讨厌同性恋
Is it okay to say that? that's not homophobic, is it?

512
00:35:10,374 --> 00:35:12,934
当然  我觉得你还是和我们不一样
I mean, I don't think you're all the same or anything.

513
00:35:22,286 --> 00:35:24,777
我当然不介意
Of course not, no.

514
00:35:25,089 --> 00:35:26,283
谢谢你
Thank you.

515
00:35:30,828 --> 00:35:34,992
我不知道凯蒂想要啥样的同性恋知己
I don't know if I was everything Katie dreamed her gay bff would be...

516
00:35:35,133 --> 00:35:36,794
不过我会尽力的
...but I tried my best.

517
00:35:36,901 --> 00:35:40,735
更重要的是  我说服她给海扁王发了邮件
More importantly, I talked her into mailing Kick-Ass.

518
00:35:41,772 --> 00:35:45,710
长话短说  她的那个可怜巴巴的朋友
Long story short, this particular lame duck of hers...

519
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:48,042
如今成了一条地头蛇
...turned out to be more of a lame cobra.

520
00:35:49,013 --> 00:35:51,382
她不需要他还钱
She didn't want the money back she'd given him...

521
00:35:51,382 --> 00:35:54,374
也不接受他对自己施暴的道歉
...or an apology for the black eye he'd given her.

522
00:35:54,652 --> 00:35:58,247
她只想让他明白他们毫无瓜葛了
She just wanted him to get that they were through and leave her alone.

523
00:35:58,656 --> 00:36:02,888
说真的  我十分乐意为此效劳
And let's be real, no other request could have given me more pleasure.

524
00:36:20,211 --> 00:36:23,203
你他妈是什么东西  蔬菜套套吗
Who the fuck are you supposed to be? The green condom?

525
00:36:24,448 --> 00:36:27,008
小鬼  离万圣节还有几个月呢
You know it ain't halloween for another few months, kid?

526
00:36:27,485 --> 00:36:29,077
我是来找拉苏尔的
I'm here to see Rasul.

527
00:36:30,821 --> 00:36:32,220
你谁啊
Who the fuck are you?

528
00:36:32,723 --> 00:36:35,521
我是海...我是凯蒂的朋友
I'm Ki... I'm a friend of Katie's.

529
00:36:41,465 --> 00:36:43,490
现在的小屁孩都这副德行
Kids nowadays in their tights.

530
00:36:58,015 --> 00:37:01,041
那个  你们谁是拉苏尔啊
So, which one of you guys is Rasul?

531
00:37:07,792 --> 00:37:11,922
我就是拉苏尔  认不出我的大胸吗
I'm Rasul. can't you tell by my big titties?

532
00:37:15,199 --> 00:37:17,133
你谁呀  玩万圣节把戏吗
What is this? trick or treat or something?

533
00:37:19,003 --> 00:37:21,028
见鬼  我死了
Fuck. now I'm dead.

534
00:37:22,440 --> 00:37:26,035
我给拉苏尔带个信  关于凯蒂·多玛的事
I've a message for Rasul about Katie Deauxma.

535
00:37:29,046 --> 00:37:30,104
凯蒂
Katie?

536
00:37:30,248 --> 00:37:31,545
这么说  你是拉苏尔咯
Oh, you're Rasul?

537
00:37:32,283 --> 00:37:36,117
你得离凯蒂远一点  都结束了
Okay. you gotta stay away from Katie now. It's over.

538
00:37:36,387 --> 00:37:39,914
别再纠缠她了  一切都会相安无事
So if you just leave her alone everything will be fine.

539
00:37:40,458 --> 00:37:41,447
说什么呢
What?

540
00:37:42,960 --> 00:37:45,326
小鬼  你以为你是谁啊
Yo, kid. who the hell are you?

541
00:37:45,863 --> 00:37:47,057
你这什么行头
And what is this?

542
00:37:47,865 --> 00:37:50,060
我是海扁王  别小看我
I'm kick-ass. Look me up.

543
00:37:50,668 --> 00:37:55,071
就是我在给你传话  别再缠着凯蒂
And this is me giving you a message. Leave Katie alone.

544
00:38:07,652 --> 00:38:08,846
不然怎样
Or what?

545
00:38:13,591 --> 00:38:16,151
不然  我就会回来
Or... I'll come back...

546
00:38:17,395 --> 00:38:19,420
打断你的贱腿
...and break your fucking legs.

547
00:38:24,235 --> 00:38:25,930
我不逃也不躲  来吧
I'm right here now, baby.

548
00:38:28,606 --> 00:38:29,573
我操
Fuck!

549
00:38:36,547 --> 00:38:37,536
抓住他
Hold him.

550
00:38:44,755 --> 00:38:46,416
你他妈死定了  小子
You are so fucking dead, man.

551
00:39:01,739 --> 00:39:05,641
好了  婊子们  让姑奶奶瞧瞧你们的能耐
Okay, you cunts. Let's see what you can do now.

552
00:39:06,077 --> 00:39:08,341
一二三四五
Eeny, meeny...

553
00:39:08,546 --> 00:39:10,571
上山打老虎
...miny, mo.

554
00:39:31,469 --> 00:39:32,595
搞什么
What the fuck?!

555
00:40:00,097 --> 00:40:01,962
我也有一把哟
Hey, I got one of those.

556
00:40:19,650 --> 00:40:20,639
来吧
Come on.

557
00:40:21,719 --> 00:40:23,118
这么说你想玩咯
So you wanna play.

558
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:41,196
搞毛
What the fuck?

559
00:40:44,408 --> 00:40:47,969
老兄  居然用电击枪  太娘了吧
Oh, dude, that is one gay-looking taser.

560
00:40:50,548 --> 00:40:52,345
别紧张  我们是一伙的
Relax, we're on the same team.

561
00:40:54,051 --> 00:40:54,949
起来吧
Hey, get up.

562
00:41:01,592 --> 00:41:05,392
超杀女  永远别忘记  背要朝向哪儿
Now, hit girl, we always keep our backs where?

563
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:10,430
朝向墙  爸爸  我知道  下不为例
To the wall, daddy, I know. it won't happen again.

564
00:41:11,068 --> 00:41:13,263
-对了  枪法真准  -谢谢
- Nice shot, by the way. - Thank you.

565
00:41:31,288 --> 00:41:32,277
我们走吧
Let's go.

566
00:41:33,958 --> 00:41:37,291
傻子  不能走前门
Hey, asshole, you can't use the front door now.

567
00:41:51,942 --> 00:41:53,068
等一下
Wait, wait, wait.

568
00:41:54,478 --> 00:41:55,410
什么
What?

569
00:41:56,547 --> 00:41:57,946
你是谁
Who are you?

570
00:41:58,048 --> 00:41:59,037
我吗
Me?

571
00:42:00,251 --> 00:42:01,582
我是超杀女
I'm Hit Girl.

572
00:42:03,420 --> 00:42:05,911
那是大老爸
Big Daddy.

573
00:42:12,096 --> 00:42:13,028
快来
Come on.

574
00:42:18,369 --> 00:42:19,563
过来呀
Come on!

575
00:42:56,206 --> 00:42:58,003
超杀女和大老爸
Hit girl and Big Daddy.

576
00:42:58,208 --> 00:42:59,766
他们才是真英雄
They were the real deal.

577
00:43:02,246 --> 00:43:03,304
而我呢
Me?

578
00:43:04,048 --> 00:43:06,881
就一个穿潜水服的傻帽
I was just a stupid dick in a wetsuit.

579
00:43:22,466 --> 00:43:24,764
这是什么  这到底是什么
What is this? what am I looking at here?

580
00:43:24,935 --> 00:43:28,272
是萨尔的手机  在他手里发现的
It was Sal's phone. They found it in his hand.

581
00:43:28,272 --> 00:43:30,841
应该是他在死前拍下
He must have taken that right before he died.

582
00:43:30,841 --> 00:43:34,572
我知道这很扯淡  阿弗  但是那照片里的家伙
I know this sounds fucked-up, Frankie, but that guy in the picture...

583
00:43:35,479 --> 00:43:38,642
应该就是电视上的那个超级英雄
...I think it's that superhero nut job from the tv.

584
00:43:38,849 --> 00:43:39,816
谁
Who?

585
00:43:40,851 --> 00:43:42,284
海扁王
Kick-Ass?

586
00:43:42,753 --> 00:43:44,118
就他一个人
One guy?

587
00:43:45,055 --> 00:43:48,047
等等  你是说  他一人一晚上杀了我的八个人
Hold on, you're telling me one guy killed 8 of my men tonight?

588
00:43:52,663 --> 00:43:56,793
萨尔那儿的八个  拉苏尔那边是四个
8 at Sal's place. 4 at that kid Rasul's.

589
00:43:58,135 --> 00:44:00,304
那我们街上的生意都砸了吗
We have no merchandise on the street at all?

590
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:01,396
对
Right.

591
00:44:04,174 --> 00:44:06,404
-真的就他一个吗  -我觉得是
- One guy? - I think.

592
00:44:07,177 --> 00:44:10,704
如果这是真的  那我们岂不成了纽约最大的冤大头
If you're right, we'll look like the biggest pussies in new york.

593
00:44:11,315 --> 00:44:12,805
您有何吩咐
What do you want me to do?

594
00:44:13,917 --> 00:44:18,820
我要你马上给我送上那傻逼海扁王的人头
I want kick-ass's fucking head on a stick, and I want it now.

595
00:44:28,332 --> 00:44:30,459
我发誓  我没对任何人说过
I didn't say anything to anyone, I swear.

596
00:44:30,601 --> 00:44:34,697
不错嘛  挨扁王  继续保持
Good move, Ass... kick. Let's keep it that way.

597
00:44:35,906 --> 00:44:37,464
认识这玩意吧
You know what this is?

598
00:44:38,409 --> 00:44:40,016
这是你的娘们电击枪
It's all the cartridge crap that comes

599
00:44:40,016 --> 00:44:42,004
留下来的弹夹
Out of your gay little taser when you fire it.

600
00:44:42,212 --> 00:44:43,802
你该知道警察发现后
You do know the police could have traced

601
00:44:43,802 --> 00:44:45,511
会立刻展开追查吧
This right back to you if they'd found it?

602
00:44:45,716 --> 00:44:48,810
算你走运  我捡起来了
But lucky for you... I picked it up.

603
00:44:49,987 --> 00:44:51,079
谢谢
Thank you.

604
00:44:52,122 --> 00:44:56,160
保险起见还是我们拿着吧  也好让我们信任你
Let's call it insurance. makes it easier for us to take your word.

605
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:59,561
听着  我们喜欢你  但是不信任你
See, we like you, but we don't trust you.

606
00:45:00,664 --> 00:45:03,500
对事不对人  我们谁都不信
Don't take it personal. we don't trust anybody.

607
00:45:03,500 --> 00:45:06,003
我变更了你的IP地址
I re-routed your IP address.

608
00:45:06,003 --> 00:45:09,666
不然他们能轻易找到你
Finding you was way too easy.

609
00:45:10,507 --> 00:45:14,378
该死  我怎么没想到  天啊
Oh, shit. shit, I hadn't thought. my god.

610
00:45:14,378 --> 00:45:16,744
我欠你们的
I, I owe you.

611
00:45:17,047 --> 00:45:19,880
我正打算关闭我的网站
I'm thinking of shutting my site down anyway.

612
00:45:20,384 --> 00:45:24,616
我是说我不干了  这太疯狂了
Quitting. I mean, this is... it's fucking insane.

613
00:45:25,022 --> 00:45:27,091
真是超出我的想像
I'm in way over my head.

614
00:45:27,091 --> 00:45:29,393
真可惜  你很有潜质
It's a shame. you have potential.

615
00:45:29,393 --> 00:45:32,829
由你决定  如有需要  我们一直在你身边
Your call. but you know we're around if you need us.

616
00:45:33,831 --> 00:45:35,766
我怎么联系你们
How do I get a hold of you?

617
00:45:35,766 --> 00:45:37,568
你只需联系市长办公室
You just contact the mayor's office.

618
00:45:37,568 --> 00:45:39,934
他会向天空投射信号
He has a special signal he shines in the sky.

619
00:45:40,104 --> 00:45:41,969
是个巨大老二的形状
In the shape of a giant cock.

620
00:45:43,073 --> 00:45:46,310
需要我们的话  就在网站上写"度假中"  我们会找到你

622
00:45:50,414 --> 00:45:51,540
好梦
Sweet dreams.

623

我要你做掉海扁王
I need you to get rid of Kick-Ass.

624
00:45:59,690 --> 00:46:02,250
-怎么了  -什么怎么了
- Yo. whoa, whoa, whoa. what's up? - What's up?

625
00:46:02,693 --> 00:46:05,685
海扁王在毁掉我的生意  希甘特
Kick-Ass is killing my men, gigante, that's what's up.

626
00:46:06,430 --> 00:46:08,193
我很遗憾  弗兰克
My condolences, Frank.

627
00:46:08,432 --> 00:46:11,869
但这次恐怕我帮不了你
But I'm afraid I can't help you on this one.

628
00:46:11,869 --> 00:46:15,873
-这有点超出我的职权范围了  -你说什么
- little bit outside my jurisdiction. - Outside your jurisdiction?

629
00:46:15,873 --> 00:46:17,741
你他妈的不是警察吗  他这是在干违法勾当
You're a fucking cop and he's breaking the law.

630
00:46:17,741 --> 00:46:21,078
这事不该你管他妈的该谁管
That's so inside it's ball-deep in your jurisdiction's ass.

631
00:46:21,078 --> 00:46:22,170
听我说
Listen to me.

632
00:46:22,412 --> 00:46:25,711
我拿工资抓坏人  你则贿赂我不要抓坏人
The cops pay me to nail the bad guys. you pay me not to.

633
00:46:25,816 --> 00:46:29,730
-其它都是灰色地带的事  -滚你妈的  照做就是
- Everything else is in the grey area. - fuck you very much. just do it.

634
00:46:29,730 --> 00:46:30,116
明白吗
Okay.

635
00:46:31,855 --> 00:46:33,720
真他妈难以置信
Un-fucking-believable.

636
00:46:34,892 --> 00:46:37,156
柯迪人呢  他迟到了
Where's Cody? he's late.

637
00:46:37,661 --> 00:46:41,961
谢谢  柯迪  感谢你的合作
Thank you, Cody. We appreciate your co-operation.

638
00:46:42,065 --> 00:46:43,734
能放我走了吗
Let me out now?

639
00:46:43,734 --> 00:46:45,861
我把名字和地址都给你们了
I gave you all them names and addresses.

640
00:46:46,870 --> 00:46:48,338
我不会和任何人说的
Hey, I won't say nothing to nobody.

641
00:46:48,338 --> 00:46:50,908
你和你的矮个朋友去随心所欲打击邪恶吧
You and your crazy midget friend can go bash whoever you want.

642
00:46:50,908 --> 00:46:51,608
拜托
Hey, come on.

643
00:46:51,608 --> 00:46:55,312
我认识一些城里的坏蛋  坏到极点了
Hey, I know some very bad people up town. really nasty individuals.

644
00:46:55,312 --> 00:46:57,147
放我走吧  求你了
Let me go. hey, come on.

645
00:46:57,147 --> 00:46:59,809
别这样  你们别这样  求你了
Hey, hey, don't do this. you don't need to do this. come on.

646
00:47:00,851 --> 00:47:02,216
求你们了
Please. hey.

647
00:47:04,254 --> 00:47:05,380
拜托  不要
Come on, no, no...

648
00:47:07,758 --> 00:47:09,623
不要  求求你们
No, no, no! come on, please!

649
00:47:11,061 --> 00:47:13,029
你们疯了
Hey, you're crazy. please!

650
00:47:25,342 --> 00:47:27,071
真是个废渣
What a douche.

651
00:47:40,557 --> 00:47:42,957
你之前也涂过护肤霜吧
You have done self tan before, right?

652
00:47:43,594 --> 00:47:46,154
没错  家常便饭
Yeah, like, I do it all the time.

653
00:47:46,864 --> 00:47:50,095
谋杀  超级英雄夜闯卧室
Murder, superheroes breaking into my bedroom.

654
00:47:50,200 --> 00:47:53,931
我的生活完全成了个扯淡而醒不来的梦
My life had turned into some fucked-up dream I couldn't wake up from.

655
00:47:55,172 --> 00:47:57,936
就连这美好的一刻也是那么梦幻
Even the good parts were totally surreal.

656
00:47:58,408 --> 00:48:01,011
我看了你给我的《蜘蛛侠》故事
Oh, hey, I read those old Ditko Spidermans you gave me.

657
00:48:01,011 --> 00:48:02,444
真的非常不错
They're actually pretty good.

658
00:48:03,680 --> 00:48:05,113
当然啦
Yeah, they are.

659
00:48:06,617 --> 00:48:09,381
而且拉苏尔有一星期没找我了
And it's been a whole week since I've heard from Rasul.

660
00:48:12,589 --> 00:48:13,988
那真是太好了
That's great.

661
00:49:09,279 --> 00:49:14,444
很久以前  有两个超级警察  老爸和马库斯
Once upon a time there were 2 supercops called Daddy and Marcus...

662
00:49:14,584 --> 00:49:17,144
他们非常擅于惩奸除恶
...who were very good at getting bad guys.

663
00:49:18,488 --> 00:49:21,224
弗兰克·达米科是个罪大恶极的恶棍
Frank D'Amico was the baddest guy of them all...

664
00:49:18,488 --> 00:49:21,224
{\an8}{\fn方正黑体简体\fs18\b1\bord1\shad1\3c&H2F2F2F&}马上给我找希甘特警探

665
00:49:21,224 --> 00:49:24,421
他想出了一个陷害老爸的招数
...and he came up with a plan to get rid of daddy.

666
00:49:25,421 --> 00:49:27,298
给我搜

667
00:49:28,298 --> 00:49:30,633
对老爸来说  被陷害为一个毒贩
Being framed as a drug dealer was the

668
00:49:30,633 --> 00:49:33,600
是最糟糕不过的事情
Worst thing that could have happened to daddy.

669
00:49:30,633 --> 00:49:33,600
{\an8}{\fn方正黑体简体\fs18\b1\bord1\shad1\3c&H2F2F2F&}罪名成立

670
00:49:35,739 --> 00:49:39,106
监狱不该是他的栖息之地
Prison was not his natural habitat.

671
00:49:39,476 --> 00:49:41,307
他非常沮丧
He was very upset.

672
00:49:42,307 --> 00:49:44,581
英雄警察入狱

673
00:49:44,881 --> 00:49:48,783
老爸入狱后  他那怀有身孕的妻子孤身一人
With daddy in prison, his pregnant wife was all alone...

674
00:49:50,087 --> 00:49:51,952
无法接受这一事实
...and could not cope.

675
00:49:54,524 --> 00:49:58,551
但就在她死后  柳暗花明又一村
But all clouds have a silver lining and out of her death...

676
00:50:02,499 --> 00:50:04,490
敏蒂降生了
...Mindy was born.

677
00:50:04,701 --> 00:50:07,329
马库斯成了孩子的监护人
Marcus became the child's guardian...

678
00:50:07,571 --> 00:50:10,540
而老爸则着手于他的计划
...and daddy started a plan of his very own.

679
00:50:12,642 --> 00:50:16,669
5年后  他出狱了  已经蓄势待发
5 years later he left prison, and he was ready.

680
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:24,120
现在  该敏蒂整装就绪了
Now it was time for Mindy to get ready, too.

681
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:33,762
你是怎么找到我的  马库斯
How did you find me, Marcus?

682
00:50:34,531 --> 00:50:36,965
忘了吗  我还是警察 
One of us is still a cop, remember?

683
00:50:45,909 --> 00:50:47,677
你就是这样对敏蒂洗脑的吗
Is this how you brainwashed Mindy?

684
00:50:47,677 --> 00:50:50,447
你觉得是洗脑  我觉得是场游戏
You say brainwashed, I say made it into a game.

685
00:50:50,447 --> 00:50:52,244
你觉得这很好玩吗  达蒙
You call this playing, Damon?

686
00:50:52,382 --> 00:50:55,909
私自执法  肆意屠杀  得了  拍档
Vigilante justice. mass murder. come on, partner.

687
00:50:57,888 --> 00:50:59,412
她在哪儿
So where is she?

688
00:50:59,856 --> 00:51:01,847
-她很安全  -我能见见她吗
- She's safe. - Can I see her?

689
00:51:03,493 --> 00:51:04,926
我很想她
I miss her.

690
00:51:06,563 --> 00:51:08,531
我很想你们
I miss you both.

691
00:51:08,965 --> 00:51:13,163
谢谢你的关心  但你该走了
I appreciate your concern, but you need to go now.

692
00:51:18,675 --> 00:51:22,412
我得提醒你  希甘特那混蛋在找海扁王
I should warn you, that asshole Gigante is looking for kick-ass.

693
00:51:22,412 --> 00:51:24,277
你们和他有牵连吗  达蒙
He got something to do with you, Damon?

694
00:51:24,381 --> 00:51:27,951
你是不是组成了什么超级英雄团队
You started some kind of fucked-up superhero club?

695
00:51:27,951 --> 00:51:31,352
-从没听过他  -好吧  小心点  好吗
- Never heard of him. - Okay. heads up, all right?

696
00:51:31,555 --> 00:51:33,423
你要是这么继续下去
You keep carrying on like you been carrying on,

697
00:51:33,423 --> 00:51:36,187
希甘特盯上你也只是时间问题而已
It's only a matter of time before Gigante is looking for you.

698
00:51:36,593 --> 00:51:40,461
自从你拒绝了之后  他就一直为达米科做事
He's been on D'Amico's payroll ever since you passed up the opportunity.

699
00:51:41,131 --> 00:51:43,031
你知道我不会罢手的
You know I'm not gonna stop.

700
00:51:44,401 --> 00:51:48,269
直到达米科和他的组织粉碎殆尽
Not until D'Amico and his whole damn operation...

701
00:51:48,371 --> 00:51:52,364
入土成灰
...are burnt to ashes and buried.

702
00:51:53,643 --> 00:51:55,508
你就不该把她卷进来  达蒙
It ain't gonna bring her back, damon.

703
00:51:56,780 --> 00:51:59,271
这不该是敏蒂的生活
This is not the life for Mindy.

704
00:52:01,985 --> 00:52:03,976
你欠她一个童年
You owe that kid a childhood.

705
00:52:05,355 --> 00:52:07,414
我告诉你是谁欠了她的童年
I'll tell you who owes her a childhood.

706
00:52:07,858 --> 00:52:09,883
弗兰克·达米科
Frank D'Amico!

707
00:52:28,712 --> 00:52:30,373
我靠
Holy shit.

708
00:52:32,849 --> 00:52:35,443
真他妈难以置信
I don't fucking believe it.

709
00:52:38,522 --> 00:52:40,149
跟着他  转弯
Follow him, round the corner.

710
00:52:41,191 --> 00:52:42,453
别太快
Not too fast.

711
00:52:45,862 --> 00:52:47,625
他居然还和路人击掌
What's with the high-fives?

712
00:52:48,064 --> 00:52:50,191
等我给你来上一拳
