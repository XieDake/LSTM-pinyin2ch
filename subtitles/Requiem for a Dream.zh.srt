50
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:33,220
我们应该从布雷迪那买一批货 然后拆开来卖
We need to get us a piece of this Brody shit, cut it up and off it!

00:17:07,420 --> 00:17:10,920
我很开心
That makes me feel really good.

145
00:17:13,320 --> 00:17:16,020
从前也有人对我这样说过
Other people have told me that before,

146
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:18,620
不过那都没有意义
And it was meaningless.

147
00:17:26,120 --> 00:17:31,320
为什么? 因为你觉得 他们只是想泡你?
Why? Because you thought they were pulling your leg?

148
00:17:31,420 --> 00:17:34,820
不 不是那样 我的意思是…
No,no,not like that. I mean...

149
00:17:34,920 --> 00:17:38,520
我也说不清 或者说我跟本不在乎他们怎么想
I don't know. I don't know or even care if they were.

150
00:17:38,620 --> 00:17:40,820
只是从他们口中说出来...
Just from them it was...

151
00:17:42,920 --> 00:17:46,520
就是毫无意义 你懂吗?
Just meaningless, you know?

152
00:17:47,620 --> 00:17:51,120
但是当你说时 我听到了
When you say it, I hear it.

153
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:55,220
我真的听到了
I really hear it.

154
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:05,920
宝贝 你能给我带来好运
Somebody like you could really make things all right for me.

155
00:18:06,020 --> 00:18:07,920
你这样想?
You think?

156
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:12,520
这是什么?
What is it?

157
00:18:12,620 --> 00:18:15,820
记得我和你说 开店的事么?
Remember when I told you about the store?

158
00:18:15,860 --> 00:18:17,290
恩
Yeah.

159
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:20,270
我思考了很久 然后...
I've been thinking about it and...

160
00:18:20,310 --> 00:18:23,220
我找了一些资料...
I put together some numbers and...

161
00:18:23,320 --> 00:18:25,320
我觉得这事可行
And it's not impossible!

162
00:18:26,420 --> 00:18:29,120
我是说 你知道吗 你可以做的
I mean,you know,you could do it.

163
00:18:29,160 --> 00:18:31,020
你应该做的
You should do it!

164
00:18:31,120 --> 00:18:34,020
我们可以一起来做
I mean, we could do it together.

165
00:18:41,020 --> 00:18:42,820
你觉得呢?
What do you think?

166
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:48,890
够了
Stop already.

167
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:53,720
穿礼服会比吃面包更快乐的
You'll feel better in the red dress than in the cheese Danish.

168
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:33,020
三件事 三件事改变了我的生活
Three things changed my life. Three.

169
00:20:33,060 --> 00:20:35,720
第一 不吃红肉
Number one. No red meat!

170
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:38,890
想想看 为何有人偏喜欢红肉?
Think about it. What do they stick in red meat?

171
00:20:38,920 --> 00:20:43,420
我吃红肉到了整块...生吃的地步
I ate red meat to the point where I would eat it... right off,raw.

172
00:20:43,520 --> 00:20:45,820
我喜欢吃肉 但我彻底改变了
I loved my meat. I turned it around.

173
00:20:45,920 --> 00:20:49,620
你要坚定 你要有激情
You need to be committed. You need to be passionate.

174
00:20:49,660 --> 00:20:53,120
三十天不吃红肉 不吃红肉
No red meat for 30 days. No red meat!

175
00:20:53,220 --> 00:20:57,320
三件事 只做这三件事就改变了我的生活
Three things is all I did to change my life. Three things.

176

艾达告诉我们了 真是太好了

难道你把她放在发汗箱里了?
Did you put her in a sweatbox?

她吃了医生给开的药就瘦了 你不会想吃的
She went to a doctor and he gave her pills. You don't want to eat.

190
00:21:50,410 --> 00:21:55,320
你的意思是 可以坐在这不去想面包上的熏肉吗?
So? You mean,I'm sitting here not thinking about pastrami on rye?

191
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:58,690
你不该在别人节食的时候说这样的话
Don't talk like that when someone's on a diet.

192
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:02,020
没关系 我会再偷吃片柚子的

222
00:25:01,520 --> 00:25:05,020
- 一切就搞砸了 - 我知道

你知道吗? 商家甚至在瓶装水里也放糖

我曾得了嗜糖症 那曾是我的药
I was sick with sugar. That was my medicine.

236

它浸蚀我的大脑 让我觉得自己是个失败者

我不明白 你为什么非要去见他
I don't understand why you gotta see him.

251
00:27:35,820 --> 00:27:38,990
真他妈的 你不要再理他了
Cut the son of a bitch loose,for Christ's sake.

252
00:27:39,020 --> 00:27:43,420
如果不去 他会告诉我父母我没有接受心理治疗
Because he'll tell my parents that I've stopped therapy.

253
00:27:43,520 --> 00:27:46,620
他们已经开始考虑和我断绝关系了
They're already thinking of cutting me off.

254

Stop that!

261
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:14,820
-我要把你的眼球吸出来 -嗯

265
00:28:26,620 --> 00:28:28,390

没什么大不了的?
"Big deal?"

当你打给很久没联系的人时 通常是因为有事
Well,it's usually the case... you gotta call for someone you haven't heard for a while.

嘿 我们也去佛罗里达怎么样?
Hey. What would happen if we went down there to cop?

640
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:12,150
-你开什么玩笑? -不是玩笑
-Are you serious? -Why not?

641
01:05:12,180 --> 01:05:14,500
你瞎说的什么啊?
What the fuck are you sayin'?

642
01:05:14,600 --> 01:05:18,900
难道随便去找个狗屁旅馆 问人家有没有卖毒品的住进来?
Goin' up to the motherfucker room clerk at some hotel and askin' for a connection?

643
01:05:19,000 --> 01:05:22,900
管它呢 你不是告诉我 毒品在周围的时候你就能闻到么?
Get with it. You tellin' me you can nose our some dope when it's around?

老兄 我们没什么可失去的了 现在正是大好时机
Man,we got nothin' to lose. It's wide open.

And if we get there right away we can name our own price,

646
01:05:30,030 --> 01:05:33,200
那群毒鬼会自动拿着钱给我们送来的
and sit back and be cool and have those fucking fools scufflin' the streets for us.

647
01:05:35,500 --> 01:05:40,200

Yeah,man. Last summer was a motherfuckin' ball,huh,Jim?

Just seems like a thousand years ago since last summer,man.

649

哥们 我们会再像那时一样的
It'll be like that again,man.

650
01:05:54,900 --> 01:05:57,300
安吉尔会告诉我们路线的...
I could get Angel to get us a short...

651
01:05:57,400 --> 01:06:00,200
只要我们保证给他带回些高档货

-我的胳膊 我的胳膊痛得要命 -我来看一下
-It's my arm. My arm is killin' me. -Let's have a look at it.

831
01:24:08,100 --> 01:24:10,000
我等一下就回来
I'll be back in a minute.

832
01:24:36,700 --> 01:24:38,900
我想通宵玩二十一点
I wanna just play blackjack all night long.

833
01:24:39,000 --> 01:24:43,900
所以我就来排班 我说 "你们去吧 我不是很舒服"
So I make up this routine. I told "you gays go ahead. I don't feel good.You gays go..."

834
01:24:43,930 --> 01:24:46,160

As soon as they leave,

837
01:24:52,300 --> 01:24:55,800
我就跑回赌场继续玩二十一点
I go running back to the casino,sit at my blackjack table.

838
01:24:55,900 --> 01:24:57,900
我整晚都泡在那里

我发誓 过了一会
I swear to God. The hours are going by.

841
01:25:06,700 --> 01:25:10,600
我又跟一个十七岁的辣妹搭讪 真是爽呆了
I'm laying back,hitting on a hard 17s. It was beautiful.

842
01:25:10,700 --> 01:25:12,900
然后呢
Next thing I know,

843
01:25:13,000 --> 01:25:17,800
一位保安坐在我旁边 叫我离开
This gay sitting next to me is the security guard and telling me I have to leave.

844
01:25:17,900 --> 01:25:21,200
我说 "你为什么要我离开?"
I asked why,"Why you telling me I have to leave?"

845
01:25:21,300 --> 01:25:23,700
他说 "因为你..."
He said,"You have to leave because..."

846
01:25:29,500 --> 01:25:31,100
吞下

848
01:26:07,000 --> 01:26:10,800
你要吃东西 如果你想痊愈的话就要吃东西
You have to eat,Mrs Goldfarb. If we're gonna get you healthy you have to eat.

849
01:26:10,900 --> 01:26:15,400
