是的。请问什么事？
Yes. Can I, um,help you?

我叫David，Peterson夫人。
My name is David,

00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:46,800
我，哦……
I, uh...

12
00:02:46,860 --> 00:02:48,770
我认识您儿子，Caleb
I knew your son Caleb.

13
00:02:48,860 --> 00:02:51,140
我们一起训练，一起服役
We trained together and served together

14
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,840
并且成为好朋友
and, uh, well, we came to be good friends.

15
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:56,710
噢，哦……
Oh, um...

16
00:02:58,770 --> 00:03:00,810
你想进来吗？
Would you like to come inside?

17
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:04,120
谢谢！夫人
Thank you, ma'am.

18
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:16,290
你需要点儿什么吗？
So, are you sure I can't get you anything?

19
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:19,570
或许喝点水，那就很好
Mmm-hmm. Maybe just some water would be nice.

20
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,740
你怎么到这儿的？
How did you get here?

21
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:30,380
跑步
I ran.

22
00:03:30,470 --> 00:03:31,970
我需要锻炼
I needed the exercise.

23
00:03:33,210 --> 00:03:35,090
从巴士站，我意思，从城里
From the bus station, I mean, in town.

24
00:03:35,510 --> 00:03:37,220
你跑了整段路？
You ran that whole way?

25
00:03:37,310 --> 00:03:38,480
是的，夫人
Yes, ma'am.

26
00:03:41,250 --> 00:03:42,250
给你
Here you go.

27
00:03:42,350 --> 00:03:43,830
好的，谢谢夫人
All right. Thank you, ma'am.

28
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,240
你什么时候出来的？
When did you get out?

29
00:03:57,930 --> 00:04:00,440
哦，我周三刚退伍
Well, I was discharged on Wednesday

30
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,710
从Fort Kennilworth直接来了这儿
and I came straight here from Fort Kennilworth.

31
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:04,580
你直接先来了这儿？
You came straight here first thing?

32
00:04:05,110 --> 00:04:09,210
是啊，我应该尽快过来，但我还得回去
Yeah. I wanted to come by sooner, but I couldn't get leave.

33
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:10,880
为什么？
Why?

34
00:04:11,610 --> 00:04:13,330
噢，我退伍是因为我受伤了
Well, I was discharged 'cause I was wounded.

35
00:04:13,380 --> 00:04:15,790
我还得在部队医院住一阵子
I was in a military hospital for a bit,

36
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,190
也没什么要紧的
so it wasn't really the kind of thing

37
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:18,730
所以能离开
you could get leave from.

38
00:04:19,420 --> 00:04:21,560
别担心，只是还有些弹片在背上
Ah, but don't worry, it was just a bit of shrapnel in my back.

39
00:04:21,620 --> 00:04:22,900
很快就能好
I'm right as rain now.

40
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,600
我意思，为何你先来了这儿？
No, I meant, urn, why did you come here first thing?

41
00:04:25,690 --> 00:04:29,610
哦，就像我说的，我和你儿子Caleb，我们……
Ah, well, like I said, me and your son Caleb, we were, uh...

42
00:04:31,030 --> 00:04:32,640
我们非常亲密
We were pretty close.

43
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,050
他死时我跟他在一起
I was with him when he died.

44
00:04:39,470 --> 00:04:41,250
- 真的？ - 是的，夫人
- Really? - Yes, ma'am.

45
00:04:41,540 --> 00:04:46,790
他请求我来看望你
And one of the things he asked was for me to check on you all.

46
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:49,290
你和你的全家人
You and your whole family here. Uh...

47
00:04:51,820 --> 00:04:54,490
他要我告诉你，他爱你
He wanted me to tell you that he loved you.

48
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:59,560
他还特别让我告诉每个人
He specifically wanted me to tell each one of you that

49
00:05:00,730 --> 00:05:01,730
他爱你们
he loved you and

50
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:03,270
他一直思念你们知道最后
he was thinking of you guys up until the end.

51
00:05:03,330 --> 00:05:06,840
我说我一定做到。于是，我来了
I said I'd do that and so, here I am.

52
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:17,950
请原谅我
Would you excuse me, please?

53
00:05:50,450 --> 00:05:51,450
那是我
That's me.

54
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,390
就在那儿
Right there.

55
00:05:58,950 --> 00:06:00,490
哦，是的
Well, I'll be...

56
00:06:03,020 --> 00:06:04,970
我记得那一天
I remember that day.

57
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:13,810
我没有让你心烦吧？夫人
It wasn't my intention to upset you, ma'am.

58
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:16,380
或许我应该提前打个电话
I probably should have called first,

59
00:06:17,540 --> 00:06:19,710
只是我还没有手机
but I don't own a cell phone yet

60
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:22,310
并且，我想，我只是没考虑
and, um, I guess, I just wasn't thinking.

61
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:23,550
就直接过来了
I'm going to be on my way now,

62
00:06:23,650 --> 00:06:25,350
如果你愿意我们可以写e-mail
but I'd like it if we could exchange e-mails...

63
00:06:25,410 --> 00:06:26,480
等等，别
Wait. No.

64
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:29,230
Anna，Caleb的妹妹，她上夜班
Anna, Caleb's sister, she works nights,

65
00:06:29,320 --> 00:06:30,390
她睡的晚
and she sleeps late.

66
00:06:30,490 --> 00:06:32,490
我想她一定愿意跟你见面
And I know she would love to meet you.

67
00:06:33,050 --> 00:06:35,160
你能不能等会儿再走？
Would you stay a little while longer?

68
00:06:35,820 --> 00:06:37,240
噢，你不会只是说客气话吧
Oh, you're not just saying that to be polite now?

69
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:38,330
你没必要这样
'Cause you don't need to be.

70
00:06:38,390 --> 00:06:41,340
我不是，请留下……
No, I'm not. Please, stay. It's...

71
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:43,670
我很高兴你来这儿
It's nice having you here

72
00:06:43,730 --> 00:06:47,200
我也很愿意听听你和Caleb更多的事
and I would love to hear more about you and Caleb.

73
00:06:48,900 --> 00:06:50,410
好吧
Well, all right.

74
00:07:07,960 --> 00:07:09,920
……Caleb和我，我们认为那声音
...Caleb and me, we figure that sounds, uh,

75
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:11,530
更多像是另外一种挑战
more like a challenge than anything else.

76
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:14,600
那晚他睡着后
So, uh, that night after he falls asleep,

77
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:17,640
我们挤了整管胶水在他床上
we kind of crept over to his cot with a tube of superglue.

78
00:07:17,730 --> 00:07:18,800
哦，不！
Oh, no!

79
00:07:19,030 --> 00:07:20,780
我们没对他做太坏的事
We didn't do anything too bad to him,

80
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:23,710
尽管我们可以，你知道
though, uh, we could have, you know.

81
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:28,920
嗨，你来了，Anna，这是David
Hey, there you are. Anna, this is David.

82
00:07:30,210 --> 00:07:31,780
很高兴见到你
Very nice to meet you.

83
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,720
Caleb告诉我很多你的事
Caleb told me a lot about you.

84
00:07:33,950 --> 00:07:35,390
David这周刚刚退役
David just got discharged this week.

85
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:37,120
他是你哥哥的朋友
He was a friend of your brother's.

86
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:38,920
你认识Caleb？
You knew Caleb?

87
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:40,560
是啊，女士
Yes, ma'am.

88
00:07:42,220 --> 00:07:43,400
“是啊，女士”
"Yes, ma'am"

89
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:45,060
好吧
Okay.

90
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:48,230
那么，你住在哪儿？
So, um, where are you staying?

91
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:52,730
我注意到有个汽车旅馆就在高速路旁边……
Well, I noticed a motel off the highway on the way here...

92
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:54,840
不不，你在这儿时可以跟我们住一起
No, no, no, no. You will stay with us while you're here.

93
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:56,970
不，我不能打扰你们
Oh, no. I couldn't put you all out.

94
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:59,450
瞎说，我们愿意你住这儿，有足够的房间
Nonsense. We would love to have you. We have plenty of room.

95
00:07:59,510 --> 00:08:01,780
其实，你可以住Caleb的房间
In fact, you can stay in Caleb's old room.

96
00:08:02,480 --> 00:08:03,790
我们坚持
We insist.

97
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:05,760
好吧，恭敬不如从命
Well, I won't argue.

98
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,920
就一晚
Just for tonight, though.

99
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:12,030
我得去餐馆上班了
Well, I've got to head to the diner.

100
00:08:12,490 --> 00:08:13,970
真的很高兴认识你
It was really great meeting you.

101
00:08:14,360 --> 00:08:16,130
我也是，高兴认识你
Likewise. Very nice meeting you.

102
00:08:16,190 --> 00:08:18,670
估计晚点儿还能见面
I guess I'll see you later. Bye.

103
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:20,830
哦
Um...

104
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:23,000
我带你看看房间吧
Can I show you to your room?

105
00:08:23,330 --> 00:08:24,330
好啊
Great.

106
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:28,670
浴室里有干净的毛巾
There are clean towels in the bathroom

107
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:31,150
如果你想洗个澡
if you'd like to freshen up.

108
00:08:32,670 --> 00:08:35,850
peterson夫人，确定我留下你没觉得不舒服？
Mrs. Peterson, are you sure you're comfortable with me staying in here?

109
00:08:37,110 --> 00:08:38,350
当然
Of course.

110
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:41,960
我意思，这房间也用不上
I mean, it's not like it's going to any use.

111
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:47,290
我想这对我们都是好事
I think it could be a good thing for us.

112
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,000
哦……
Uh...

113
00:08:52,660 --> 00:08:54,370
我先离开，你收拾吧
I'm gonna go and let you get settled in.

114
00:08:54,460 --> 00:08:56,370
如果需要什么，就喊一声
If you need anything, just holler.

115
00:10:03,770 --> 00:10:05,470
噢，上帝
Oh, my God!

116
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:08,070
Fucking pussy.

117
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:09,640
噢，上帝
Oh, my God!

118
00:10:10,140 --> 00:10:11,140
Oh.

119
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,650
没事啊，宝贝儿，别哭
Oh, it's okay, little baby, don't cry. Aw.

120
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:41,910
嗨
Hey, there.

121
00:10:42,840 --> 00:10:44,320
今天怎么样？
How was your day?

122
00:10:44,570 --> 00:10:45,570
不错
It was good.

123
00:10:45,610 --> 00:10:46,640
很好
Great.

124
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:55,320
……未免也太偶然，我不喜欢这样
...giving him a chance, it's that I don't like the idea of

125
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:57,620
随便邀请大街上个家伙留下
some random guy off the street being invited to stay

126
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:01,430
跟我的家人在一起
in my house with my family.

127
00:11:04,260 --> 00:11:06,600
那么，你认识我哥哥？
So, you knew my brother?

128
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:12,550
认识，还很熟，是的
I did, pretty well, yeah.

129
00:11:15,470 --> 00:11:19,820
他让我告诉你们，他爱你们
He wanted me to tell you that he loved you.

130
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:24,990
噢，谢谢！
Oh. Thanks.

131
00:11:25,480 --> 00:11:27,150
……即使他说是Caleb的朋友
Even though he says he was friends with Caleb.

132
00:11:27,220 --> 00:11:29,160
他在Caleb小队的照片里
He's in the photograph of Caleb's squad.

133
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:30,360
你看了照片
You saw the photograph.

134
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:31,490
- 他不是陌生人。- 你知道吗？
He was not a stranger. You know what?

135
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:32,690
如果他有创伤综合症
What if he has the PTSD

136
00:11:32,790 --> 00:11:33,990
或者其他什么呢？
or whatever it's called?

137
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:36,470
一些像他这样的家伙回来都有心理健康问题，Laura
Some of these guys come back with mental health problems, Laura.

138
00:11:36,520 --> 00:11:37,870
你有没有考虑这些？
Did you take that into account?

139
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,630
如果Caleb回来也不一样了呢？
What if Caleb had come back different?

140
00:11:40,800 --> 00:11:42,300
你是不是也考虑了？
Did you take that into account?

141
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:46,980
哇，那可真是……哼……
Wow, that is... Hmm...

142
00:11:51,010 --> 00:11:52,710
你父母为我在吵架
Your parents are fighting about me.

143
00:11:53,980 --> 00:11:55,980
是啊，吵的很凶
Yeah. They argue a lot.

144
00:11:56,840 --> 00:11:58,020
Huh.

145
00:12:01,220 --> 00:12:03,220
看起来你好像受了伤
You look like you got hit or something.

146
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:09,270
是啊，体育课踢足球碰伤的
Yeah, yeah, I got hit with a football in gym class.

147
00:12:10,830 --> 00:12:12,360
是啊，经常的事
Yeah, that can happen.

148
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:15,330
Yeah.

149
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,080
不不，你是对的，让我们跟他谈谈
No, no, you're right, you're right. Let's talk to him.

150
00:12:19,430 --> 00:12:21,070
嗨，好吧
Hi, great, okay.

151
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:23,750
David，我们很高兴你在这儿
David, we're very happy to have you here.

152
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,580
晚饭前我要喝瓶啤酒，你要吗？
I'm gonna have a beer before dinner.
Can I offer you one?

153
00:12:26,670 --> 00:12:29,250
- 哦，不了，谢谢！ - 好吧，你随便。
Well, no, thank you.
No. Okay. Suit yourself.

154
00:12:29,340 --> 00:12:31,020
晚餐一个小时内就好
And dinner is gonna be ready in an hour.

155
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:33,290
那么Luke，为什么你不去做功课呢
So, Luke, why don't you do some homework.

156
00:12:35,380 --> 00:12:36,380
好吧
<i>Okay-</i>

157
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:37,690
David，你需要什么吗？
David, can I get you anything?

158
00:12:37,750 --> 00:12:40,060
不了，谢谢你Peterson夫人，我很好
Oh, no, thank you, Mrs. Peterson, I'm fine.

159
00:12:43,860 --> 00:12:44,960
耶，接招
<i>Yeah, hit this.</i>

160
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:48,200
小心
Look out... Shit.

161
00:12:49,460 --> 00:12:51,600
No...

162
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:57,150
不，我很好，谢谢
Now? No, I'm good, but thank you.

163
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:04,620
那么，你哥哥的朋友，他就留在这儿？
So, that friend of your brother's,
is he sticking around?

164
00:13:05,210 --> 00:13:06,720
不知道，希望不是
I don't know. I hope not.

165
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:08,650
为什么？你说你喜欢他
Why? You said you liked him.

166
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:11,620
我说他看起来和善，这可是不同的
I said he seemed nice. That's not the same thing.

167
00:13:12,220 --> 00:13:13,390
Oh, okay.

168
00:13:14,790 --> 00:13:16,230
你为啥喜欢他？
Why don't you like him?

169
00:13:16,890 --> 00:13:18,500
我没有喜欢他
I don't not like him.

170
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:20,970
只是，我……
It's just, I...

171
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:24,070
我意思，你了解Caleb
I mean, you kind of knew Caleb.

172
00:13:29,000 --> 00:13:30,240
我们都……
We've all...

173
00:13:33,070 --> 00:13:35,680
我只知道爸妈试着向前看
I just know Mom and Dad have been trying to move on

174
00:13:36,010 --> 00:13:38,820
不像是想有太多回忆在这个镇子
and it's not like they don't have
enough reminders in this town.

175
00:13:39,010 --> 00:13:40,010
Yeah.

176
00:13:41,650 --> 00:13:43,250
我不知道，只是觉得太正常了
I don't know, that seems pretty normal to me.

177
00:13:43,320 --> 00:13:45,760
你知道，孩子死了，那可很难啊
You know, like, your kid dies. That's hard.

178
00:13:48,590 --> 00:13:50,260
Yeah.

179
00:13:51,630 --> 00:13:53,750
或许我们只是不需要一个走着、呼吸着的提醒者
Guess we just don't need
a walking, breathing reminder

180
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,780
如同现在，你知道
of him right now, you know?

181
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:00,110
是啊，绝对
Yeah. Totally.

182
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:04,610
我得走了
I've got to go.

183
00:14:08,210 --> 00:14:10,350
嘿，等下，等下
Hey, wait a second. Wait a second.

184
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:11,620
- 别，我不能。- 什么？
Stop. I can't... What!

185
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:13,840
不不，再呆会儿，就一会儿
No, no. Let's just hang out,
like, a little bit longer.

186
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:15,150
- 我不能。 - 就一会儿。
I can't. Just a little bit longer.

187
00:14:15,220 --> 00:14:16,490
不行，我得走了
I can't. Mmm-mmm. I have to go.

188
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:18,360
- 你没必要非得走。 - 不，我得走
You don't have to go.
Yes, I do.

189
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,220
我们应该有时间明天在Kristen家见面，好吗？
But I'm sure we can find some time
at Kristen's tomorrow, okay?

190
00:14:21,320 --> 00:14:22,820
Hmm.

191
00:14:26,830 --> 00:14:28,310
停，我得走了
Stop, I have to go.

192
00:14:31,470 --> 00:14:33,970
正弦是船锚的直角
The sine is the angle of the ship's anchor cable,

193
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:35,550
那么电缆是直角三角形的斜边
so the cable is the hypotenuse,

194
00:14:35,640 --> 00:14:36,840
那么我们如何计算出
and what we need to find out

195
00:14:36,900 --> 00:14:38,850
到海底的距离
is the distance down to the ocean bottom,

196
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:41,920
那是对立面，看见没？
so that's the opposite. Do you see?

197
00:14:44,250 --> 00:14:45,520
不是吧
Not really.

198
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:51,600
你应该很聪明吧
So, you're kind of smart, huh?

199
00:14:55,090 --> 00:14:56,500
我想是吧
I guess so.

200
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:01,870
嘿，工作怎样？
Hey, how was work?

201
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,070
还行，不忙
Good. Not too busy.

202
00:15:04,230 --> 00:15:05,840
David，来瓶啤酒吗？
David, sure I can't get you a beer?

203
00:15:06,100 --> 00:15:08,270
好吧，来一瓶，谢谢
You know, I will have one. Thank you.

204
00:15:08,400 --> 00:15:10,180
- 我也要
- 是啊，就知道你也要
- I'll take one, too.
- Yeah, I'm sure you will.

205
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,550
再一个月我就21岁了
I'm 21 in a month.

206
00:15:11,610 --> 00:15:12,950
那你就可以喝掉所有的啤酒了
You can have all the beer you want then,

207
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,040
如果你自己买的话
assuming you buy it yourself.

208
00:15:20,520 --> 00:15:22,260
你帮他做作业？
Are you helping him with his homework?

209
00:15:23,280 --> 00:15:25,360
不全是
Well, not exactly.

210
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:31,570
嘿，别走，呆会儿，聊聊
Hey, don't go. Stick around, be sociable.

211
00:15:31,890 --> 00:15:34,030
有点累了，我得躺下了
Ugh, I'm kind of tired. I think I'm gonna lay down.

212
00:15:34,930 --> 00:15:36,470
好吧，随便了
Okay. Suit yourself.

213
00:15:40,740 --> 00:15:43,810
但是Allan,他名字叫Allan
But Allan, his name's Allan,

214
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:45,380
他来了只有，什么
he's only been there for, what,

215
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,050
差不多4年，但他却晋级了
like, four years, but he's got a degree,

216
00:15:48,140 --> 00:15:52,780
于是“砰”，突然他就成地区经理了，我不是
so, boom, suddenly he's regional manager and I'm not.

217
00:15:54,480 --> 00:15:56,480
没关系，我是说，无所谓
And that's okay. I mean, it's okay.

218
00:15:57,050 --> 00:16:00,730
但我了解Laura，我知道她担心
But I know Laura, I know she's worried.

219
00:16:00,790 --> 00:16:02,930
她怀疑我究竟
She wonders if I'm ever,

220
00:16:02,990 --> 00:16:05,330
还能不能挣到钱
ever going to make any money.

221
00:16:07,560 --> 00:16:09,630
你妻子是尊重你的，先生
Your wife seems to respect you, sir.

222
00:16:10,900 --> 00:16:11,970
噢，是的
Oh, yeah. Yeah.

223
00:16:12,400 --> 00:16:14,240
这倒是，你知道
It is what it is, you know.

224
00:16:15,300 --> 00:16:18,580
那么你怎么样？有什么计划？
What about you, though? What about you? What are your plans?

225
00:16:18,940 --> 00:16:20,610
想着明天去坐巴士
Figured I'd get on a bus tomorrow,

226
00:16:20,680 --> 00:16:21,960
向南去佛罗里达或什么地方
head down to Florida or something

227
00:16:22,110 --> 00:16:23,150
开始找份工作
and start looking for work.

228
00:16:23,180 --> 00:16:24,420
我以前是做建筑工程的
I've done construction work before.

229
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:26,250
所以，我确定我能找到
So, I'm sure I'll find something.

230
00:16:26,350 --> 00:16:29,350
不不，太疯狂了
No, no, no, no, no. That's crazy.

231
00:16:29,850 --> 00:16:31,190
太疯狂，你都不知道要去哪里
That's crazy. You don't know where you're going.

232
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:32,820
留下来多呆几天
Stay here for a couple more days.

233
00:16:32,920 --> 00:16:34,700
不，我不能
No. No, I can't.

234
00:16:34,990 --> 00:16:37,830
我不能再利用你们的好意，先生
I couldn't impose on your hospitality any longer, sir.

235
00:16:37,930 --> 00:16:39,170
你没有……对我们利用……
You're not... Impose on our...

236
00:16:39,260 --> 00:16:41,000
先生？你称呼我先生？
And "sir"? You're calling me "sir" now?

237
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,200
别再叫我先生，我的名字是Spencer
You gotta stop with the "sir," my name's Spencer.

238
00:16:43,300 --> 00:16:45,280
你必须叫我Spencer，天啊
You gotta call me Spencer, for God sakes.

239
00:16:45,330 --> 00:16:46,440
Okay-
Okay-

240
00:16:46,500 --> 00:16:47,780
好吧
All right. Okay.

241
00:16:47,870 --> 00:16:49,610
那么你就呆在这一带，对吗？
So you're sticking around, right?

242
00:16:49,670 --> 00:16:51,950
你呆在这儿至少等到你知道要去哪儿
You stick around at least till you know where you're going.

243
00:16:54,110 --> 00:16:57,650
好吧，或许就几天，好吗？
Well, maybe just a couple more days, all right.

244
00:16:57,710 --> 00:17:00,220
好极了，说定了
Cool, excellent. It's a deal.

245
00:17:03,120 --> 00:17:05,530
让我们再喝两瓶庆祝下
Let's have a couple more of these to celebrate,

246
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:07,530
然后我就得上床了
and then I've got to get off to bed.

247
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:09,290
天，把你的酒喝完
God, you can put your liquor away.

248
00:17:10,990 --> 00:17:12,340
我想是的
I guess so.

249
00:17:12,860 --> 00:17:14,240
我累了，你累吗？
I'm tired. Are you tired?

250
00:17:15,800 --> 00:17:17,470
不，我还不想睡
No, I don't need much sleep.

251
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:55,210
你在这儿干什么？
What are you doing here?

252
00:17:56,100 --> 00:17:58,780
我告诉你妈妈今天我来学校接你
I told your mom I could pick you up
from school today.

253
00:17:59,770 --> 00:18:00,910
好不好？
That cool?

254
00:18:01,010 --> 00:18:02,110
Yeah.

255
00:18:04,510 --> 00:18:07,580
你不像是有什么朋友啊
Don't you, like, have any friends?

256
00:18:08,350 --> 00:18:10,060
我有很多朋友
I have lots of friends.

257
00:18:13,420 --> 00:18:16,270
只是，不在这。在网上。
Just not, like, here. Like, online.

258
00:18:19,060 --> 00:18:20,470
Oh.

259
00:18:33,870 --> 00:18:35,220
你在等什么？
What are you waiting for?

260
00:18:35,610 --> 00:18:37,890
我要你指给我昨天谁打了你
I want you to show me who hit you yesterday.

261
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:40,890
我是踢足球碰伤的
I got hit with a football.

262
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,590
Yeah.

263
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:49,270
你打算做什么？
What are you going to do?

264
00:18:49,560 --> 00:18:50,590
不坏的事
Nothing bad.

265
00:18:57,060 --> 00:18:58,100
那边
Over there.

266
00:18:59,170 --> 00:19:00,410
全都是？
All of them?

267
00:19:00,570 --> 00:19:02,910
哦，看起来他们给我出了个难题
Well, most of them give me a hard time.

268
00:19:04,010 --> 00:19:06,650
那两个，Mike和Ian，是最坏的
Those two guys, Mike and Ian, are the worst.

269
00:19:06,740 --> 00:19:08,620
这俩家伙是真正的混蛋
Those guys are real assholes.

270
00:19:14,250 --> 00:19:15,590
能走了吗？
Can we go now?

271
00:19:18,450 --> 00:19:19,490
是
Yes.

272
00:19:36,270 --> 00:19:37,270
你在干什么？
What are you doing?

273
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:39,340
他们要去酒吧
They're going to a bar?

274
00:19:40,110 --> 00:19:41,310
Uh, yeah,

275
00:19:41,380 --> 00:19:43,660
这地方只服务足球队的人
this place will serve you if you're on the football team.

276
00:19:44,210 --> 00:19:46,620
好吧，我想去喝一杯
Well, I could use a drink.

277
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:48,280
你怎么样？
How about you?

278
00:19:49,950 --> 00:19:50,990
不
No.

279
00:20:10,300 --> 00:20:11,680
来吗？
You coming?

280
00:20:12,970 --> 00:20:14,540
不
No.

281
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:20,010
好吧，如果你改主意了，我就在里面
Well, I'll be inside if you change your mind.

282
00:20:43,170 --> 00:20:44,950
见鬼？
What the fuck?

283
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:48,240
嗨，Luke
Hey, Luke.

284
00:20:54,380 --> 00:20:56,090
可能是他的男朋友什么的
Maybe it's his boyfriend or something?

285
00:21:05,190 --> 00:21:06,300
对不起
Excuse me.

286
00:21:14,540 --> 00:21:16,040
我需要看看身份证
I'm gonna need to see some ID.

287
00:21:17,370 --> 00:21:18,910
所有人的身份证？
You ID all of them?

288
00:21:23,640 --> 00:21:25,320
你要点什么？
What can I get you?

289
00:21:25,880 --> 00:21:27,660
你知道怎么做个火球吗？
Do you know how to make a fireball?

290
00:21:27,750 --> 00:21:30,060
肉桂杜松子酒加辣椒酱
Cinnamon schnapps and Tabasco sauce.

291
00:21:30,150 --> 00:21:32,760
那就是我要的酒，来一杯
That's my drink of choice. Let me get one of those.

292
00:21:33,050 --> 00:21:34,760
给我弟弟来瓶可乐
A Coke here for my brother,

293
00:21:35,390 --> 00:21:36,630
我不禁注意到
and I can't help but notice

294
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:39,070
那边一些女生再喝便宜的啤酒
that those ladies over there are drinking cheap beer.

295
00:21:39,130 --> 00:21:40,300
这让我觉得有点惭愧
That seems like a shame to me.

296
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:42,740
我愿意给她们每人买一份blowjob shot
I'd like to buy each one of them a blowjob shot.
注：blowjob shot，一种用酒、饮料、奶油调制的饮品，
盛在小酒杯中，不用手，直接用嘴叼起，仰脖饮下，状似口交。

297
00:21:44,270 --> 00:21:47,110
- 你是认真的？ - 是的。
Are you serious?
I am, yes.

298
00:21:48,400 --> 00:21:50,520
那你愿意给那几个小伙子买点什么吗？
Do you wanna buy anything for their fellas?

299
00:21:52,470 --> 00:21:55,450
我看起来像喜欢给那几个小伙子买东西的吗？
Do I look like I'd like to buy something for their fellas?

300
00:21:55,740 --> 00:21:57,620
可能会显得比较礼貌
Might be the polite thing to do.

301
00:22:00,920 --> 00:22:02,260
好吧
Sure, okay, fine.

302
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:06,260
给他们每人一杯大都会鸡尾酒
I'm gonna get each one of those guys a cosmopolitan.

303
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:09,600
先生，我不知道你是为了什么
Mister, I don't know what you're going for,

304
00:22:09,660 --> 00:22:11,360
不过我想着只是啤酒
but, uh, I was thinking a beer.

305
00:22:11,590 --> 00:22:14,510
不，blowjob shot给女士
No. Blowjob shots for the ladies,

306
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:16,670
大都会鸡尾酒给那几个家伙
and a cosmopolitan for each of the guys.

307
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:19,310
不用找钱了
You keep the change on that.

308
00:22:20,100 --> 00:22:21,140
你说了算
You got it.

309

你很富有吗？
Are you, like, rich?

钱是容易挣的

他不需要穿上衣服
He doesn't need to be in costume

312
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:39,980
把自己装成个屁股
to make an ass out of himself.

313
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:45,660
你的可乐，你的火球
Here's your Coke, here's your fireball.

314
00:22:46,130 --> 00:22:48,160
他们的酒马上就好

好

318
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:05,680
天啊！
God!

319
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:10,060
这干脆就是辣椒
It's like hot peppers.

320
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:11,750
噢，你喜欢喝这个？
Ugh, you drink that?

321
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:13,990
是的
Yep.

322
00:23:16,990 --> 00:23:17,990
噢！
Ah!

323
00:23:20,390 --> 00:23:21,700
你是怎么做到的？
How do you do that?

324
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:24,670
习惯就好了
You get used to it.

325
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:42,590
那边桌子那位给的
From that table over there.

326
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:43,860
那个家伙？
That fucking guy?

327
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:47,020
他们看起来很生气

328
00:23:47,520 --> 00:23:48,520

00:23:51,690 --> 00:23:52,970
谢谢你的酒

不客气

331
00:23:56,700 --> 00:23:57,870
<i>Mmm.</i>

332
00:23:58,630 --> 00:24:00,630
我不想要，不过，你可以
I don't want it, though. You can have it.

333
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:19,930
可能你更喜欢这个
Well, maybe you prefer this.

334
00:24:20,920 --> 00:24:22,560
噢，我的眼睛
Ow! My eyes!

335
00:24:23,290 --> 00:24:24,500
嘿，你……
Hey, you...

336
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:05,000
嘿，Luke
Hey, Luke.

337
00:25:05,830 --> 00:25:06,830
Luke.

338
00:25:13,510 --> 00:25:14,680
不错
Cool.

339
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:16,450
你俩应该离开了
You guys should get out of here.

340
00:25:18,980 --> 00:25:20,540
报警并且告诉警察事实
Call the police and tell them the truth.

341
00:25:21,980 --> 00:25:23,500
一帮学校的孩子来这儿了
A gang of high school kids came in here

342
00:25:23,550 --> 00:25:25,000
要求你提供酒
and demanded you serve them drinks.

343
00:25:25,290 --> 00:25:27,660
你试着检查身份证
Well, you tried to ID them,

344
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:29,360
但他们威胁找麻烦
but, uh, they threatened to cause trouble.

345
00:25:29,790 --> 00:25:31,460
发生了打斗
There was a fight.

346
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:34,130
你并没有仔细看清其他家伙的脸
You didn't really get a good look at the other guys.

347
00:25:34,400 --> 00:25:36,170
另外，我想你这个地方
Otherwise, I imagine you and this place

348
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:37,710
可能会因为服务未成年人而有麻烦
could get into trouble for serving minors.

349
00:25:37,800 --> 00:25:39,330
我意思
<i>I mean,</i>

350
00:25:39,400 --> 00:25:40,850
这迟早会发生
this is what happens.

351
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:44,640
这儿
Here.

352
00:25:51,680 --> 00:25:53,160
是损坏赔偿
For the damages.

353
00:26:21,010 --> 00:26:22,610
Luke！怎么了？
Luke! What happened?

354
00:26:22,710 --> 00:26:24,190
在学校跟人打架了
I got into a fight with some guys at school.

355
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:25,850
- 你没事吧？ - 是的，没事。
Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine.

356
00:26:26,010 --> 00:26:27,790
几个成年人打了我，没什么大不了的
Some seniors were picking on me. It's no big deal.

357
00:26:27,880 --> 00:26:29,000
为什么选中你？
Why were they picking on you?

358
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:31,540
我不知道，我要回房间了，好了
I don't know, okay. I'm just going to go
to my room, all right.

359
00:26:33,350 --> 00:26:34,700
他没事吧？
Is he all right?

360
00:26:34,760 --> 00:26:36,200
是的，夫人，没事
Yes, ma'am, he's fine.

361
00:26:36,290 --> 00:26:37,890
他在学校惹了什么麻烦吗？
Did he get in trouble at the school?

362
00:26:38,060 --> 00:26:41,470
不，每人看见，只是高中那点事，你懂的
No, no one saw. It's just the usual
high school stuff, you know.

363
00:26:41,800 --> 00:26:43,640
我告诉他会教他如何自卫
I told him I'd teach him some self-defense

364
00:26:43,730 --> 00:26:45,230
如果他觉得需要的话
when he's feeling up to it.

365
00:26:45,470 --> 00:26:47,070
我确定那正是他需要的
I'm sure that's exactly what he needs.

366
00:26:48,540 --> 00:26:51,910
有你在那儿我就放心了
Well, l am very relieved that you were there.

367
00:26:54,370 --> 00:26:56,120
我准备去Kristen家了
I'm going to get ready for Kristen's.

368
00:26:56,210 --> 00:26:58,710
Anna，我们能在厨房谈下吗？
Anna, can we talk in the kitchen?

369
00:26:58,880 --> 00:26:59,880
当然
Sure.

00:27:00,580 --> 00:27:01,580
请原谅
Excuse us.

371
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:05,290
什么？
What?

372
00:27:08,390 --> 00:27:10,230
邀请他去Party
Invite him to the party.

373
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:12,600
- 为什么？ - 因为他就一个人，宝贝儿
- Why? - 'Cause he's lonely, sweetie.

374
00:27:12,660 --> 00:27:14,160
Caleb也会高兴的
Caleb would really love that

375
00:27:14,260 --> 00:27:16,500
真的？你确定这样？
Really? You're going to pull that card?

376
00:27:16,600 --> 00:27:17,940
是的
Yes.

377
00:27:20,770 --> 00:27:23,110
David，你愿意今晚跟我一起去Party吗？

00:27:26,010 --> 00:27:27,490
很好，我将在7点钟出发
Great. I'm going to leave around 7:00.

380
00:27:28,740 --> 00:27:30,150
好的
All right.

381
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:38,650
Luke，我要洗澡
Luke, I need to take a shower.

382
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:42,590
Luke!

383
00:27:44,530 --> 00:27:46,030
Luke，快点，我得……
Luke, come on, I need to...

384
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,100
对不起……
I'm sorry, uh...

00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:54,500
不，我很抱歉
Um, no, I'm sorry,

386
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,380
我以为Luke在里面
I thought Luke was in there.

387
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:00,510
我想我们该穿衣服了
Oh, I guess I better go get dressed.

388
00:28:01,980 --> 00:28:03,180
是的
Yeah, yeah.

389
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:05,120
你应该，应该穿了
You should, um, probably do that.

390
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:30,080
那么，也没什么大不了的
So, um, this isn't a big deal or anything,

391
00:28:30,170 --> 00:28:31,570
这地方不仅仅是Kristen的地方
but this isn't just Kristen's place.

392
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:33,810
我男朋友，Zeke,也住这儿
My boyfriend, Zeke, lives here, too.

393

我不知道你有男朋友
I didn't know you had a boyfriend.

394
00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:41,590
对的，我父母也不知道
Yeah, well, neither do my parents.

395
00:28:41,750 --> 00:28:43,750
我不介意保持这个秘密，如果你觉得酷的话
And I wouldn't mind keeping it that way,
if that's cool with you.

396
00:28:43,850 --> 00:28:45,190
我不会说一个字
I won't say anything.

397
00:28:45,820 --> 00:28:47,530
这不关我的事
It's none of my business.

398
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:57,040
Hi.
Hey.

399
00:28:58,670 --> 00:29:00,200

这是David，他是我哥哥Caleb的朋友

401
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:05,110
- 我曾跟你说起过。 - 你好吗！

很好，谢谢

我可以搬进来
I'll bring them in.

405
00:29:16,850 --> 00:29:17,920

Where are they?

406

在Zeke的面包车里，应该没锁
They're in Zeke's van. It should be unlocked.

407
00:29:38,410 --> 00:29:39,410
Anna?

408
00:29:41,610 --> 00:29:43,210
不，今晚不行，我倒是想……
No. I can't tonight. I wish.

409
00:29:43,280 --> 00:29:45,220

是的，他是……
Yeah, he's...

412
00:29:48,380 --> 00:29:49,920
打算放哪儿？
Where do you want these?

413
00:29:57,560 --> 00:29:59,430

好的，走
Yeah, let's go.

426

妈的
God damn it.

427

他们是谁？
Who are they?

428
00:31:30,020 --> 00:31:32,660
我的前任，这我刚刚告诉你
No. That's my ex. The one I was just telling you about.

429
00:31:38,330 --> 00:31:41,670
嘿，我得跟你谈谈
Hey, I need to talk to you.

430
00:31:42,430 --> 00:31:43,910
我正忙着，Drew
I'm busy right now, Drew.

431
00:31:44,500 --> 00:31:46,710
我整个星期都在给你打电话
I've been calling you all week,

432
00:31:46,770 --> 00:31:49,180
然后，我听说你今晚有个Party？
and then I hear you're having a party tonight?

433
00:31:49,340 --> 00:31:50,410
怎么回事？
What the fuck?

434
00:31:51,170 --> 00:31:53,240
我正跟朋友说话，你很没礼貌
I'm talking to my friend. You're being rude.

435
00:31:53,340 --> 00:31:54,510
好吧，听着，只是……
All right, listen, just...

436
00:31:55,510 --> 00:31:56,510
过来
Come here...

437
00:31:57,540 --> 00:31:58,680
你他妈的
Motherfucker!

438
00:32:05,420 --> 00:32:07,300
把他弄出去
Get him out of here.

439
00:32:18,900 --> 00:32:20,310
抱歉你的照片
Sorry about your picture.

440
00:32:21,070 --> 00:32:23,310
不，别放在心上
No, don't worry about it.

441
00:32:25,210 --> 00:32:26,210
你……
Did you, um...

442
00:32:27,870 --> 00:32:30,410
你想不想看看其他的房间？
Did you want to see the rest of the house?

443
00:32:58,910 --> 00:33:00,250
没事吧？
Are you okay?

444
00:33:01,070 --> 00:33:02,420
是的，怎么？
Yeah. Why?

445
00:33:03,410 --> 00:33:06,020
看起来你好像不喜欢
Seems like you're not really into this.

446
00:33:07,610 --> 00:33:08,650
哦，我喜欢
Oh, I am.

447
00:33:18,090 --> 00:33:19,430
Oh...

448
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:20,940
的确
You are.

449
00:33:34,980 --> 00:33:36,450
嘿，你在这儿
Hey, there they are.

450
00:33:36,810 --> 00:33:39,020
你有什么？我有王后，他有大王
Who have you got? I got a queen. He's got a king.

451
00:33:40,280 --> 00:33:41,490
坐下
Sit down.

452
00:33:41,620 --> 00:33:44,960
还以为你离开Party了，找到了更有趣的
Thought you guys left your own party, found something better.

453
00:33:45,790 --> 00:33:48,130
- 来点儿？ - 不，我很好
Want some? No, I'm good.

454
00:33:49,190 --> 00:33:50,900
我只是……
I just...

455
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:56,800
我想说我们挺你这家伙
I wanted to say we support you guys.

456
00:33:58,030 --> 00:34:00,640
如果你需要什么，就告诉我
If you need anything, you just let me know.

457
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:03,680
怎么挺？
Support us how?

458
00:34:05,910 --> 00:34:07,410
我意思你知道，我们挺你
I mean, you know, we support you,

459
00:34:07,510 --> 00:34:10,320
就像，“冲啊美国！”，对吧？
like, "Go America!" right?

460
00:34:10,410 --> 00:34:13,860
但你不会支持我，比如，招募？
But you wouldn't support us by, like, enlisting?

461
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:17,520
Aw...

462
00:34:17,650 --> 00:34:20,060
妈的，哥们儿，他们不让我进入
Shit, man, they don't want me in there.

463
00:34:20,250 --> 00:34:21,600
我不能，你知道
No, I can't, you know.

464
00:34:21,690 --> 00:34:23,900
我惹了一堆烂事
I've got bad asthma.

465
00:34:24,160 --> 00:34:25,240
让我觉得很难……
It'd make it real hard to...

466
00:34:25,330 --> 00:34:26,400
很难什么？
Hard to what?

467
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:33,270
嘿，哥们儿，我意思，我只是……
Hey, man, I mean, I just...

468
00:34:34,830 --> 00:34:36,070
什么？
What'?

469
00:34:36,170 --> 00:34:37,770
我只是逗逗你，哥们儿
I'm just fucking with you, man.

470
00:34:38,170 --> 00:34:39,880
妈的，哥们儿
Fuck, man.

471
00:34:40,410 --> 00:34:42,080
你觉得这很逗乐，是吗Kristen？
Oh, you think that's funny, huh, Kristen?

472
00:34:42,180 --> 00:34:43,620
我会儿回来
I'll be right back.

473
00:34:49,620 --> 00:34:51,460
多好的两片屁股，啊？
Nice piece of ass there, huh?

474
00:34:53,250 --> 00:34:55,290
你能给我搞把枪吗？
Could you get me a gun?

475
00:34:57,260 --> 00:34:58,700
枪？
A gun?

476
00:35:00,030 --> 00:35:01,370
是的，我可以搞把枪
Yeah, I can get you a gun.

477
00:35:01,430 --> 00:35:02,870
你要枪干嘛？
What do you need a gun for?

478
00:35:03,230 --> 00:35:05,710
我是当兵的，哥们儿，我喜欢枪
I'm a soldier, man. I like guns.

479
00:35:05,900 --> 00:35:07,310
好吧，我认识个家伙
Yeah. I know a guy.

480
00:35:07,430 --> 00:35:08,740
有钱吗？
You got cash?

481
00:35:08,900 --> 00:35:10,040
是的
I do.

482
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,910
妈的，给我电话号码
Fuck it. Give me your number.

483
00:35:14,310 --> 00:35:16,220
我正用这个一次性的
I'm using a burner right now.

484
00:35:16,280 --> 00:35:17,380
号码在背面
Number's on the back.

485
00:35:20,250 --> 00:35:22,230
大兵喜欢枪
Soldiers like guns.

486
00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:26,930
让我出面可有点难为我
Landing a gig is huge for me.

487
00:35:27,150 --> 00:35:28,630
要是我出门了呢？
What's the big deal if I go on tour?

488
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:30,290
比如，三个星期，最多
It's, like, three weeks, max.

489
00:35:30,390 --> 00:35:32,730
为什么你不相信我，哪怕5秒钟
Why don't you trust me for, like, five seconds?

490
00:35:32,990 --> 00:35:34,770
我不知道，也许……
I don't know. Maybe...

491
00:35:36,060 --> 00:35:38,600
- 你没有理由不相信我。
- 好了打住吧
I've given you no reason not to trust me.
I'm done with this.

492
00:35:39,000 --> 00:35:40,000
不要这样
Come on.

493
00:35:43,240 --> 00:35:45,580
- 准备走吗？
- 好的
You ready to go?
Sure.

494
00:35:59,020 --> 00:36:01,260
- 我开车
- 不，我没事
I'll drive.
No, I'm fine.

495
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:06,030
我开
I'll drive.

496
00:36:06,130 --> 00:36:07,470
你醉了
You're stoned.

497
00:36:09,160 --> 00:36:11,340
你比我好很多吗？
And how are you more sober than me?

498
00:36:11,870 --> 00:36:13,440
我比你大
I'm bigger than you.

499
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:42,130
拜托，系上安全带
Please, put on your seat belt.

500
00:36:57,810 --> 00:36:59,690
- 你想谈谈吗？
- 不
Do you want to talk about it?
No.

501
00:37:03,750 --> 00:37:04,990
只是……
It's just...

502
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:09,100
没什么，只是我们有点不同意见
It's nothing. I mean, we got into an argument.

503
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,500
以前的事
It's old stuff.

504
00:37:15,360 --> 00:37:17,200
你知道他在乐队时我曾爱过他
You know, I used to love that he was in a band.

505
00:37:18,330 --> 00:37:21,400
但现在我正在为上大学攒钱
But now I'm saving money for college,

506
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:23,580
但他却不思进取
and he just isn't moving on.

507
00:37:23,670 --> 00:37:25,210
我意思，他甚至都没份工作
I mean, he doesn't even have a job.

508
00:37:26,740 --> 00:37:27,910
他是毒品贩子
Well, he's a drug dealer.

509
00:37:28,070 --> 00:37:29,850
得了，他不是毒品贩子
Okay. He's not a drug dealer.

510
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:41,700
是的，有时候卖点儿，卖给朋友赚点儿零花
Yeah. He sells drugs sometimes to, like, friends for extra cash.

511
00:37:43,360 --> 00:37:45,770
如果他不珍惜跟你在一起，他就是个傻子
Well, if he's messing things up with you,
then he's a fool,

512
00:37:45,890 --> 00:37:48,030
你也无需为此烦心
and you don't need to worry about it.

513
00:37:48,230 --> 00:37:49,710
我是认真的
No. I'm serious.

514
00:37:50,260 --> 00:37:53,040
我意思，如果我能拥有你这样的女孩儿
I mean, hell, if I'd had a girl
like you back home,

515
00:37:54,700 --> 00:37:57,740
我不会跑到中东去挨枪子儿
I wouldn't have gone over to the
Middle East to get shot at.

516
00:38:03,710 --> 00:38:04,880
谢谢
Thank you.

517
00:38:12,150 --> 00:38:13,830
我喜欢这音乐
I like this music.

518
00:38:16,290 --> 00:38:17,600
真的？
You do?

519
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:24,970
这是混合我喜欢的刻在一张碟上
It's, uh, just a mix that I made.

520
00:38:29,000 --> 00:38:30,950
如果你喜欢我可以刻张给你
I can make you one if you wanted.

521
00:38:31,400 --> 00:38:35,180
真的？能把这首歌刻进去吗？
Yeah? Can you put this song on it?

522
00:38:36,510 --> 00:38:38,420
当然，可以
Yeah, I can do that.

523
00:38:58,770 --> 00:39:01,180
那么，晚安
So, um, good night.

524
00:39:01,600 --> 00:39:02,770
晚安

不，我想继续我们的讨论
No. I want to proceed as we discussed.

530
00:41:08,390 --> 00:41:10,900
每人能认出我，这很重要
No one will be able to recognize me.
That's important.

531
00:41:11,760 --> 00:41:13,640
什么意思？“牙科记录”？
What do you mean, "Dental records"?

532
00:41:15,230 --> 00:41:17,110
整牙医生？不，我不需要
An orthodontist? No, I don't need that.

533
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:19,080
手指头，对
Fingers, yes.

534
00:41:20,110 --> 00:41:22,420
越快越好，我得挂断了
As soon as possible. I'm off the grid for now.

535
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:24,680
恐怕有人在试着找我
But there are people trying to look for me.

536
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:29,090
我明白需要时间，但这很紧迫
I understand it'll take some time,
but this is urgent.

537
00:41:29,420 --> 00:41:30,860
我只是需要张新面孔
I just need a new face.

538
00:41:32,650 --> 00:41:35,760
我会保留这部手机防止有事发生，你需要跟我联系
I'll keep this phone in case anything comes up
and you need to reach me.

539
00:41:35,820 --> 00:41:37,460
好了，挂了
All right. Copy that.

540
00:41:39,460 --> 00:41:41,940
是的，他的名字叫David Anderson Collins
Yeah, his name is David Anderson Collins.

541
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:45,200
我能告诉你他服役部队的变化，如果有帮助
I can tell you the unit that
he served in if that helps.

542
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:48,780
不，没什么事，哦……
No, nothings wrong. Um...

543
00:41:48,840 --> 00:41:51,540
他是我哥哥的朋友，我们听说他回来了
He was friends with my brother
and we heard that he was back,

544
00:41:52,110 --> 00:41:54,180
任何联系方式都是好的
so, uh, any contact information would be great.

545
00:41:54,810 --> 00:41:58,350
OK，女士，如果有消息我会打电话
Okay, ma'am. I'll call you when
we have any details.

546
00:41:59,110 --> 00:42:00,180
再见
Good bye.

547
00:42:07,180 --> 00:42:10,180

鉴于伊奥利亚计划已经终止

554
00:42:32,150 --> 00:42:35,590
关于此Richard有更多的信息汇报

我不会披露太多信息

556
00:42:40,820 --> 00:42:41,990
即使你们要求
nor would you want me to.

557
00:42:42,260 --> 00:42:43,900
不过，我可以说……

558
00:42:45,530 --> 00:42:48,010
抱歉打断你，有事情发生

非常抱歉，请各位原谅

给我订下班飞机
Book me on the next flight.

569
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,030
如果需要任何许可，去搞定
If we need to charter something, do it.

570
00:43:17,090 --> 00:43:18,690
再带上几个狙击手

如果有人问起发生了什么，我怎么说？

00:43:22,760 --> 00:43:24,210
粉饰一切

573
00:43:24,900 --> 00:43:28,040

No one outside this circle can know that any of
our subjects are still active.

574
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:29,770
如果KPG有人想在此事上退缩
If KPG gets any blowback on this,

575
00:43:29,870 --> 00:43:31,780
你和我就都完蛋了
you and I will both be hung out to dry.

576
00:43:31,870 --> 00:43:33,150
明白？
You got that?
Mmm.

577
00:43:33,540 --> 00:43:35,540
机票订好给我打电话
Call me when you got the plane booked.

578
00:43:58,400 --> 00:43:59,900
我没有晚吧
I'm not late, am l?

579
00:44:01,330 --> 00:44:03,310
没有，时间刚刚好
No, no. You're just on time.

580
00:44:05,070 --> 00:44:06,240
好的
Good.

581
00:44:06,410 --> 00:44:08,410
你看，在开始之前
Look, before we get started,

582
00:44:08,470 --> 00:44:10,820
我只是想确认你已经带了钱
I just want to make sure that you've got some cash on you.

583
00:44:10,980 --> 00:44:12,350
不想冒犯
No offense.

584
00:44:17,250 --> 00:44:18,490
这可以吧？
That should be good?

585
00:44:19,620 --> 00:44:20,760
可以
It'll do.

586
00:44:22,520 --> 00:44:23,800
开始吧
Let's get started.

587
00:44:29,500 --> 00:44:30,700
从这开始
Let's start with this.

588
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:32,280
我是说，这是把标准贝瑞塔
I mean, it's a standard Beretta.

589
00:44:32,370 --> 00:44:33,670
我相信你一定很熟悉
I'm sure you're familiar with it.

590
00:44:33,770 --> 00:44:36,940
不要以为，你看了这把，也就看了全部
In my opinion, if you've seen one of these,
you've seen them all.

591
00:44:38,440 --> 00:44:41,380
这件宝贝，这是
But this baby, this here is

592
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:43,610
9毫米Wintness Elite精英
a 9-millimeter Witness Elite.

593
00:44:43,710 --> 00:44:46,120
看起来跟贝瑞塔很相似
It's a very similar weapon to the Beretta,

594
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:47,780
但我更喜欢这把枪的后座力
but I prefer the recoil.

595
00:44:47,850 --> 00:44:49,620
我意思，你绝对感觉不到震动
I mean, it's got absolutely no kick at all.

596
00:45:03,630 --> 00:45:04,630
当兵的？
You army?

597
00:45:05,200 --> 00:45:06,200
Yes, sir.

598
00:45:06,800 --> 00:45:08,570
我是海军
I'm navy, myself.

599
00:45:14,970 --> 00:45:16,210
很好
Yeah, that's fine.

600
00:45:19,710 --> 00:45:21,350
你要这把精英？
You want the Elite?

601
00:45:21,410 --> 00:45:22,860
噢，我要全部
Oh, I'll take 'em all.

602
00:45:24,820 --> 00:45:26,230
所有的手枪？
All the handguns?

603
00:45:26,420 --> 00:45:29,400
不，所有的，你全部的枪。
No. Everything. All your guns.

604
00:45:30,990 --> 00:45:32,090
妈的
Shit.

605
00:45:32,990 --> 00:45:34,060
跟我想的一样
That's what I was thinking.

606
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:36,940
瞧，哥们儿，如果你带了足够的钱
Look, man, if you've brought money for all of them,

607
00:45:37,160 --> 00:45:39,840
我就给你打个折，把枪全拿走
<i>I'll cut you a deal. You can take 'em
all off my hands.</i>

608
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:41,340
不，我打算杀了你
No, I'm going to kill you.

609
00:45:42,500 --> 00:45:44,540
嘿，搞什么鬼，David？
Hey, what the fuck, David?

610
00:45:44,670 --> 00:45:46,510
你听我讲他妈的最后一句
Now, you listen to me one fucking second...

611
00:45:46,570 --> 00:45:47,920
等等
Wait, wait, wait.

612
00:45:51,580 --> 00:45:52,920
不，不
No, no, no, no.

613
00:46:51,070 --> 00:46:52,170
喂？
Hello?

614
00:46:52,940 --> 00:46:54,580
对，谢谢你打回电话给我
Yeah, thanks for calling me back.

615
00:47:01,410 --> 00:47:02,690
什么？
What?

616
00:47:05,320 --> 00:47:07,590
嗨，妈妈，我能跟你说句话吗？
Hey, Mom, can I talk to you for a second?

617
00:47:07,650 --> 00:47:10,000
当然，宝贝儿，怎么了？
Sure, sweetie, what's going on?

618
00:47:10,920 --> 00:47:12,600
噢，我给军方基地打了电话
Um, I called the army base

619
00:47:12,660 --> 00:47:14,870
David说他刚从那儿退役
that David said that he was just discharged from,

620
00:47:15,290 --> 00:47:16,600
我想跟他们谈谈
I wanted to ask about him.

621
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:19,510
什么？为啥要这样做？
What? Why would you do that?

622
00:47:27,340 --> 00:47:28,340
Spencer?

623
00:47:28,770 --> 00:47:29,780
我得喝一杯
I need a drink.

624
00:47:29,840 --> 00:47:32,120
- 为什么？发生什么了？
- 让我先喝一杯，亲爱的
Why? What happened?
I'm getting a drink, honey.

625
00:47:32,450 --> 00:47:34,320
他们找到了Allan，你知道我的老板Allan吧？
They found Allan, you know my boss, Allan?

626
00:47:34,380 --> 00:47:36,490
他失踪了好多天了
He'd been missing from work for a couple of days,

627
00:47:36,550 --> 00:47:37,790
每个人都很担心
everybody got very worried

628
00:47:37,950 --> 00:47:40,790
他的一个朋友破门而入
so one of his friends went over and broke
into his house.

629
00:47:40,950 --> 00:47:42,860
发现他和他的女朋友都死了
And they found him and his girlfriend dead.

630
00:47:44,360 --> 00:47:46,530
他俩都吞了大把的药丸
They'd both taken a bunch of prescription pills,

631
00:47:46,630 --> 00:47:49,870
看起来像是一起自杀了
it was like they committed suicide together or something.

632
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:51,460
噢，我的天
Oh, my God!

633
00:47:51,630 --> 00:47:54,010
但这可有点说不通啊，他……
But that doesn't make any sense. He was...

634
00:47:54,070 --> 00:47:55,640
是啊，那家伙看起来完全正常
No. The guy was totally normal.

635
00:47:55,870 --> 00:47:58,470
警察正在调查，你知道，这是……
But the police are investigating. You know, it's, uh...

636
00:47:59,310 --> 00:48:00,550
没看出有人闯入
Doesn't look like it was a break-in.

637
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:01,880
没有强行进入的痕迹
There was no forced entries.

638
00:48:01,970 --> 00:48:04,080
她，哦……那女孩儿，她，哦……
She, uh... The girl... She had, uh...

639
00:48:05,240 --> 00:48:06,810
她的身体有伤痕
She had bruises on her body.

640
00:48:08,410 --> 00:48:09,530
我不明白怎么回事
I don't know what that means.

641
00:48:10,020 --> 00:48:12,590
不管怎么样，只能交给警察处理了
Anyway, uh, we will leave it for the police

642
00:48:12,690 --> 00:48:14,490
再告诉我们发生了什么
to tell us exactly what happened.

643
00:48:14,550 --> 00:48:15,930
我不知道
I don't know.

644
00:48:20,360 --> 00:48:23,900
讨厌的是，我将成为地区经理
Damn thing is this makes me regional manager.

645
00:48:25,160 --> 00:48:28,370
是的，他们最快速度给我打了电话
Yeah. As soon as Corporate found out,
they called me.

646
00:48:28,530 --> 00:48:31,210
他们让我立刻从明天开始
Right away they want me to start tomorrow.

647
00:48:31,270 --> 00:48:33,180
并且会支付跟Allan同样的薪水
And they're offering me Allan's salary.

648
00:48:33,340 --> 00:48:34,680
那..
So...

649
00:48:35,670 --> 00:48:37,120
那是，哦……
that's, uh...

650
00:48:37,210 --> 00:48:38,690
Yeah.

651
00:48:39,180 --> 00:48:40,420
仔细想想你需要什么
Careful what you wish for.

652
00:48:43,180 --> 00:48:44,180
David.

653
00:48:46,620 --> 00:48:47,960
抱歉打断你们
I'm sorry to interrupt

654
00:48:48,950 --> 00:48:51,590
不，别犯傻，没事
No. Don't be silly. It's fine.

655
00:48:52,460 --> 00:48:55,700
噢，我正喝酒呢，你来点吗？
Um, I'm having a drink. Would you join me?

656
00:48:57,300 --> 00:48:58,300
好的
Oh, sure.

657
00:48:59,300 --> 00:49:00,540
我马上回来
I'll be right back.

658
00:49:10,940 --> 00:49:12,650
Hello?
Hey, Anna?

659
00:49:12,750 --> 00:49:15,560
是Craig，他们在采石场刚找到他
It's Craig, babe. They just found him out at the quarry.

660
00:49:15,610 --> 00:49:18,320
他死了，有人射杀了他
He's dead. Someone shot him.

661
00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:20,050
什么？
What?

662
00:49:21,790 --> 00:49:23,160
他们知道是谁干的吗？
Do they know who did it?

663
00:49:23,460 --> 00:49:25,490
我还不知道太多细节
I don't really have all the details yet.

664
00:49:25,990 --> 00:49:27,300
晚点见面好吗？
Um, can you meet up later?

665
00:49:27,390 --> 00:49:28,460
好的
Yeah, of course.

666
00:49:30,960 --> 00:49:33,120
有点事我得告诉你
Um, there's something else I need to talk to you about.

667
00:49:33,400 --> 00:49:34,900
什么事？
What is it?

668
00:49:37,100 --> 00:49:38,510
噢，妈的
Oh, shit. Fuck.

669
00:49:38,600 --> 00:49:40,520
我得挂了，好吧，我打电话给你
Babe, I got to go, all right. I'll call you back.

670
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:42,640
Hello?

671
00:50:02,660 --> 00:50:04,440
我刚听Zeke说
I just heard from Zeke.

672
00:50:05,300 --> 00:50:06,300
你怎么样？
How are you doing?

673
00:50:07,370 --> 00:50:08,940
只是有点接受不了
I just don't get it.

674
00:50:11,100 --> 00:50:12,610
谁会伤害Craig？
Who'd want to hurt Craig?

675
00:50:13,670 --> 00:50:16,620
是啊，你能先坐下吗？
Yeah, I know. Can you sit down for a second?

676
00:50:17,510 --> 00:50:18,510
是
Yeah.

677
00:50:20,280 --> 00:50:22,280
你说怎么做来着？
So, how does this work again?

678
00:50:22,550 --> 00:50:24,390
首先在顶部挖个洞
Uh, first you make a hole at the top,

679
00:50:24,820 --> 00:50:27,130
你就能进入里面用勺子把瓤挖出来
so you can reach in and scoop all the guts out.

680
00:50:31,860 --> 00:50:33,060
天啊
Oh, man.

681
00:50:33,460 --> 00:50:35,030
你父母的刀子真恶心
Your parents' knives suck.

682
00:50:35,130 --> 00:50:36,130
是
Yeah.

683
00:50:39,630 --> 00:50:40,980
好多了
That's better.

684
00:50:41,800 --> 00:50:44,970
你总是带着它吗？
Do you carry that with you, like, all the time?

685
00:50:45,700 --> 00:50:47,810
哦，这个？是的
Oh, this thing? Sure.

686
00:50:49,840 --> 00:50:51,150
为什么？
Why?

687
00:50:52,240 --> 00:50:53,660
不知道
I don't know.

688
00:50:54,210 --> 00:50:55,420
以防万一
Just in case.

689
00:51:00,390 --> 00:51:02,990
我给David说离开的那个基地打了电话
I called the army base that David said that he was from.

690
00:51:03,560 --> 00:51:06,940
他们告诉我David Collins一周前死了
They told me that David Collins died a week ago.

691
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:10,070
亚利桑那州一所军方医院
He was in some military hospital in Arizona.

692
00:51:10,160 --> 00:51:13,340
氧气筒发生了爆炸
There was a fire from oxygen tanks.

693
00:51:14,030 --> 00:51:16,840
大概20个人死了，David Collins是其中之一
About 20 people died, David Collins was one of them.

694
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:19,510
David有任何身份证件或者信用卡吗？
Does David have any ID? Credit cards?

695
00:51:21,010 --> 00:51:22,290
我从没见过他有钱包
I've never seen him use a wallet.

696
00:51:22,710 --> 00:51:25,690
他的电话呢？他有个一次性的，是吗？
What about his phone? He has a burner, right?

697
00:51:26,250 --> 00:51:28,690
你怎么不查查他打过电话的号码？
Why don't you check some of the numbers he's called?

698
00:51:28,850 --> 00:51:30,090
你弟弟懂电脑
Your brother knows computers.

699
00:51:30,180 --> 00:51:32,030
看能不能找出什么？
Have him look some of them up.

700
00:51:32,080 --> 00:51:33,460
对，是个好主意
Yeah. That's a good idea.

701
00:51:33,550 --> 00:51:36,690
嘿，Kristen. 我觉得那一对想结账有一阵子了
Hey, Kristen. I think that couple's been done for a bit.

702
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:38,060
我来吧，谢谢
I've got it. Thanks.

703
00:51:38,860 --> 00:51:40,300
下班后打电话给我
Call me after work, okay?

704
00:51:41,130 --> 00:51:42,900
- 自己小心。 - 你也是
Take care of yourself.
You, too.

705
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:52,050
你想听听我的建议吗，Luke？
Do you want some advice, Luke?

706
00:51:53,140 --> 00:51:54,140
Sure.

707
00:51:55,910 --> 00:51:57,790
永远别让任何人作弄你
Never let anyone pick on you.

708
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:01,250
希望你能永远记住这一点
Otherwise, you'll carry it with
you the rest of your life.

709
00:52:02,050 --> 00:52:03,890
学校的那些孩子，他们比你高大些？
Those kids at school, they're bigger than you?

710
00:52:04,250 --> 00:52:05,250
Yeah.

711
00:52:05,550 --> 00:52:07,260
那就带把刀去学校
Then bring a knife to school.

712
00:52:07,820 --> 00:52:09,500
如果他们抢走了并且打了你
If they take it off of you and beat you up,

713
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:10,920
你就晚上到他们的房子
you go around their houses at night

714
00:52:10,960 --> 00:52:12,560
一把火烧了那房子和里面的人
and burn them down with their families inside.

715
00:52:12,630 --> 00:52:14,160
他们能做什么？
What's the worst they can do?

716
00:52:17,400 --> 00:52:19,270
Yeah. Okay.

717
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:24,240
给，你留着
Here. You keep it.

718
00:52:25,340 --> 00:52:27,110
你把这给我？
You're giving this to me?

719
00:52:27,170 --> 00:52:29,150
是的，你的了，我还有其他的
Yeah, man, it's yours. I've got others.

720
00:52:29,240 --> 00:52:30,240
谢谢
Thanks.

721
00:52:32,280 --> 00:52:33,620
Hey.

722
00:52:34,650 --> 00:52:35,850
爸妈在吗？
Mom and Dad around?

723
00:52:35,950 --> 00:52:37,090
没，他们去商店了
No. They went to the store.

724
00:52:37,150 --> 00:52:39,250
你妈妈做了南瓜派
Your mom's making pumpkin pie.

725
00:52:41,090 --> 00:52:42,330
酷
That's cool.

726
00:53:00,770 --> 00:53:02,150
吗的
Shit.

727
00:53:03,780 --> 00:53:05,020
Fuck!

728
00:53:51,060 --> 00:53:52,060
Fuck.

729
00:53:53,090 --> 00:53:54,500
天阿
Oh, my God!

730
00:53:57,930 --> 00:53:58,930
Hello.

731
00:53:59,600 --> 00:54:01,600
Hey, it's, uh, me.

732
00:54:02,430 --> 00:54:03,440
Hey.

733
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:10,040
什么？
What?

734
00:54:11,710 --> 00:54:15,680
他们在你的面包车里找到了杀Craig的枪？
They found the gun that killed Craig in your van?

735
00:54:19,180 --> 00:54:21,130
是的，这是嫁祸于我
Yeah, it was wiped clean.

736
00:54:21,220 --> 00:54:23,420
我猜警察收到了匿名的报告
Um, I guess they just got an anonymous tip or something.

737
00:54:23,760 --> 00:54:25,240
但你是无辜的
But you're innocent!

738
00:54:25,860 --> 00:54:29,270
Anna，我知道，但他们又搜查了我的房间
Anna, I know, but' um, then they searched my room,

739
00:54:29,360 --> 00:54:31,240
于是找到了些其他东东，你知道的
and they found some other stuff. You know.

740
00:54:31,300 --> 00:54:33,870
所以，看起来我得在这儿呆一阵子了
So, it looks like I'm actually gonna be
here for a little while.

741
00:54:37,240 --> 00:54:38,770
我爱你
I love you, all right?

742
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:42,720
我知道，我得挂了
Yeah, I know. I gotta go.

743
00:54:44,210 --> 00:54:45,590
<i>Okay -</i>

744
00:54:45,910 --> 00:54:47,120
爱你，拜
Love you, bye.

745
00:55:15,310 --> 00:55:17,950
亲爱的，没事吧？
Honey, you okay?

746
00:55:20,410 --> 00:55:21,410
I, um...

747
00:55:22,780 --> 00:55:24,520
我得朋友Craig今天被杀了
My friend Craig was killed today.

748
00:55:26,290 --> 00:55:28,600
噢，天啊，对不起
Oh, my God. I'm so sorry.

749
00:55:28,650 --> 00:55:30,930
怎么了？发生了什么？
How? What happened?

750
00:55:32,290 --> 00:55:34,000
他中枪了，我不知道
He was shot. I don't know.

751
00:55:36,700 --> 00:55:38,370
为此他们逮捕了Zeke
And they arrested Zeke for it.

752
00:55:38,500 --> 00:55:40,640
- Zeke?
- I'm sorry, honey.

753
00:55:40,930 --> 00:55:43,140
但是如果他们逮捕了你的前任男朋友
But if they arrested your ex-boyfriend,

754
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:44,940
那多半有个很好的理由
it was probably for a very good reason.

755
00:55:45,270 --> 00:55:47,710
我们都知道Zeke在这个社区并非什么好鸟
We all know Zeke was never exactly
a pillar of this community.

756
00:55:48,970 --> 00:55:52,320
他不是我前任男朋友，爸爸，是现任男朋友
He's not my ex-boyfriend, Dad, he's my boyfriend.

757
00:55:52,610 --> 00:55:54,720
我一直跟他在一起
I never stopped seeing him.

758
00:55:54,850 --> 00:55:56,520
我已经20岁了，我可以跟任何人约会
I'm 20 years old, I can date who I want.

759
00:55:56,620 --> 00:55:57,960
只要你还生活在这所房子里，就不能
As long as you live in this house, you cannot.

760
00:55:58,020 --> 00:56:00,020
你并不了解他，一点也不了解
Oh, you know nothing about him! Nothing!

761
00:56:00,150 --> 00:56:02,500
- 我知道他是个毒贩子和瘾君子……
- 是吗，爸爸！
I know he's a drugged-out punk junkie...
Really, Dad!

762
00:56:02,550 --> 00:56:03,560
在我女儿17岁的时候
...who started
dating my daughter

763
00:56:03,660 --> 00:56:05,640
就开始跟她约会，这就是我知道的
when she was 17 years old,
is what I know.

764
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:08,300
好吧
Right.

765
00:56:10,530 --> 00:56:12,030
他怎么样呢？
What about him?

766
00:56:14,530 --> 00:56:16,480
每个人最好的朋友
Everybody's best friend.

767
00:56:17,800 --> 00:56:19,510
我给他说离开的基地打了电话
I called the military base that he said he was from

768
00:56:19,570 --> 00:56:20,910
他们告诉我，他已经死了
and they told me he was dead.

769
00:56:25,710 --> 00:56:28,350
哦，那对于你可是个军事情报
Ah, that's military intelligence for you.

770
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:33,050
好吧，看看他的身份证吧
Right. Ask to see his ID.

771
00:56:34,320 --> 00:56:37,660
他不是David Collins，我们不知道他是谁
He's not David Collins, okay. We don't know who he is.

772
00:56:40,490 --> 00:56:43,910
受伤之前我是特种部队的一员
I was part of a special forces
unit when I was injured,

773
00:56:44,030 --> 00:56:47,030
所以他们会给你提供个封面故事
so they should be providing a cover story

774
00:56:47,100 --> 00:56:48,700
如果一般平民问到我
if any civilians ask about me.

775
00:56:48,770 --> 00:56:50,510
这是好事
That's a good thing.

776
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:54,380
但我没有拿我的军牌
But I did get my dog tags back.

777
00:56:54,510 --> 00:56:55,780
Uh...

778
00:56:56,410 --> 00:56:57,720
他们的在这儿
They're right here.

779
00:57:01,350 --> 00:57:03,690
我不喜欢戴，因为……
I don't like to wear them because, uh...

780
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:06,390
我不知道，但是……
Well, I don't know, but, um...

781
00:57:07,550 --> 00:57:09,360
我喜欢带着它们，尽管，你知道
I like having them with me, though, you know.

782
00:57:10,520 --> 00:57:13,060
至于身份证，我没有一个目前的证明
As for ID, I don't have a current license,

783
00:57:13,190 --> 00:57:16,400
但我有份文件在我包里，我是否应该去……
but, uh, I've got my documents in my bag.
Should I go...

784
00:57:16,730 --> 00:57:19,210
不不，没那个必要
No, no, no. That won't be necessary.

785
00:57:21,530 --> 00:57:24,610
Anna Peterson，你现在欠他一个道歉
Anna Peterson, you owe him an apology right now.

786
00:57:24,700 --> 00:57:26,740
- 妈的没门儿
- 小心你的说话
No fucking way.
You watch your mouth, young lady.

787
00:57:27,370 --> 00:57:29,080
关于你的朋友Craig，我十分抱歉
I am very sorry about your friend Craig.

788
00:57:29,140 --> 00:57:30,640
发生这样的事的确可怕
That's a terrible thing that happened.

789
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:33,750
就目前来看，我可以负责人地说
As far as it goes with Zeke Hastings and his crew,

790
00:57:33,810 --> 00:57:35,160
Zeke Hastings和他的团队
I have it on very good authority

791
00:57:35,250 --> 00:57:36,780
毫无疑问是一帮毒贩子
they're nothing but a bunch of pot dealers.

792
00:57:36,880 --> 00:57:38,920
你需要知道的只是他为何因为谋杀被捕
You wanna know why Zeke was arrested for murder?

793
00:57:38,980 --> 00:57:40,990
或许他真干了，这就是为什么
Because he probably did it, that's why.

794
00:57:43,060 --> 00:57:44,430
- Fuck you!
- Ugh.

795
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:46,730
Hey, now, Anna.

796
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:51,400
很抱歉，亲爱的。David，我很抱歉
I'm sorry, honey. David, I'm terribly sorry.

797
00:57:51,600 --> 00:57:55,130
不，没什么，她只是……难受罢了
No, that's okay. She's, uh... She's upset.

798
00:57:58,900 --> 00:58:00,410
我或许的确应该早点……
I probably should have explained

799
00:58:00,470 --> 00:58:03,980
……解释清楚特种部队的事
the, uh, special forces thing earlier,

800
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:08,920
只是，我们没有想到会谈到这些事
it's just, we're not really supposed to talk about it.

801
00:58:09,250 --> 00:58:11,120
不，我明白
No. I understand.

802
00:58:12,250 --> 00:58:13,660
Uh...

803
00:58:13,750 --> 00:58:16,130
我得再喝点儿，你呢，David？
I could use a drink. How about you, David?

804
00:58:17,460 --> 00:58:18,760
Yes, please.

805
00:58:39,110 --> 00:58:40,110
什么？
What?

806
00:58:46,820 --> 00:58:47,820
Hey.

807
00:59:02,030 --> 00:59:03,840
我只想说……
I just wanted to <i>say, uh...</i>

808
00:59:11,310 --> 00:59:14,350
我只想说Craig的事我也感到很遗憾
I just wanted to say how sorry I am about Craig.

809
00:59:15,410 --> 00:59:17,390
他看起来是个好人
He seemed like a really cool guy.

810
00:59:18,850 --> 00:59:23,060
还有Zeke被捕…… 很抱歉
And Zeke getting arrested... Again, I'm very sorry.

811
00:59:23,860 --> 00:59:26,360
在这紧张的时刻我知道你们并不需要我
I know you don't need me here at this stressful time.

812
00:59:28,330 --> 00:59:31,000
没帮上忙我觉得羞愧
I'm not helping, which is a shame,

813
00:59:32,230 --> 00:59:33,710
因为我答应Caleb我会……
because I promised Caleb I would do

814
00:59:33,770 --> 00:59:35,840
……尽我所能帮助你的全家
anything I could to help your family.

815
00:59:37,170 --> 00:59:38,170
但就这样你知道
But just so you know,

816
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:39,580
我会在几天之内搬走
I'll be moving on in a couple of days.

817
00:59:39,670 --> 00:59:42,210
你不会再忍受我了，好吗？
So, you don't need to put up with me much longer, okay?

818
00:59:53,690 --> 00:59:54,960
Okay.

819
00:59:58,860 --> 01:00:00,030
<i>Okay-</i>

820
01:00:02,190 --> 01:00:03,640
好
Good.

821
01:00:09,970 --> 01:00:11,380
这是什么？
What is this?

822
01:00:11,700 --> 01:00:12,740
给我刻的CD？
Is this the CD you made me?

823
01:00:14,870 --> 01:00:15,870
是的
Um, yeah.

824
01:00:16,740 --> 01:00:18,080
刻完了？
Is it done?

825
01:00:21,210 --> 01:00:22,210
是的
Yeah.

826
01:00:22,780 --> 01:00:24,390
好的，谢谢
Well, thank you.

827
01:00:25,820 --> 01:00:27,300
等不及听听了
I can't wait to listen to it.

828
01:00:42,130 --> 01:00:44,050
我要每个枪手在半径100英里以内
I want every contractor within a 100-mile radius.

829
01:00:44,100 --> 01:00:45,270
不管他们从哪儿赶过来
And I don't care where they come from.

830
01:00:45,340 --> 01:00:47,080
KPG的人、前军人，不管谁
KPG, ex-military, whatever.

831
01:00:47,170 --> 01:00:49,810
我着陆的时候每支队伍都要动员起来
I'll need a team mobilized by the time l land.

832
01:00:49,910 --> 01:00:51,820
我将会给每个人布置必需的任务
I'll give them the necessary mission specs in person.

833
01:00:51,910 --> 01:00:53,650
不能冒任何风险让此事泄露
We can't risk a leak on this.

834
01:00:55,250 --> 01:00:56,450
祝好运
Good luck.

835
01:01:06,420 --> 01:01:08,530
你拍了David电话的照片？
You took a picture of Davids phone?

836
01:01:09,160 --> 01:01:10,870
是的，我在网上付款
Yeah. I paid for a reverse directory thing

837
01:01:10,960 --> 01:01:12,500
可以查出电话号码
to look the number up online.

838
01:01:12,600 --> 01:01:15,770
说是一个迈阿密的医生的没有记录名册的号码
It said it was this unlisted landline of a doctor in Miami.

839
01:01:15,830 --> 01:01:17,280
他的名字是Peter Boddington
His name's Peter Boddington.

840
01:01:17,340 --> 01:01:18,940
此外他根本不是个医生
Except he's not a doctor anymore.

841
01:01:19,370 --> 01:01:21,010
两年前他失去了执照
He lost his license two years ago

842
01:01:21,110 --> 01:01:23,470
因为酒醉后给一名妇女做脸部整容
after performinga face lift on a woman
while he was drunk.

843
01:01:23,540 --> 01:01:26,490
那么，David认识这家伙？我意思，或许是他的叔叔什么的
So, David knows the guy? I mean, maybe it's
his uncle or something.

844
01:01:26,650 --> 01:01:28,390
我就是为什么我想搞清楚
That's what I'm trying to figure out.

845
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:30,050
我需要跟警察谈谈
I need to talk to the police.

846
01:01:30,150 --> 01:01:32,030
警察在Zeke的房间找到了这些毒品
The cops found those drugs in Zeke's room,

847
01:01:32,120 --> 01:01:33,960
所以警察认为他们抓对了人
so they think they've got their guy.

848
01:01:34,020 --> 01:01:35,500
你需要我干什么？
So, what do you need me to do?

849
01:01:35,650 --> 01:01:38,530
找到任何这家伙的信息
Get any information you can on this guy.

850
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:42,800
你确实觉得是David杀了Craig和另外那家伙
Do you really think David killed Craig
and that other guy?

851
01:01:43,530 --> 01:01:44,970
是的
Yeah. I do.

852
01:01:47,130 --> 01:01:48,980
好吧，我看看能不能发现什么
Okay. I'll see if I can find anything.

853
01:01:49,530 --> 01:01:51,210
谢谢，Luke
Thank you, Luke.

854
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:22,270
抱歉，晚点我再给你看看一些魔术技巧
I'm sorry. I'll show you some magic tricks later. Just...

855
01:02:22,670 --> 01:02:23,670
Um...

856
01:02:45,690 --> 01:02:47,690
嘿，笨蛋
Hey, faggot.

857
01:02:50,630 --> 01:02:52,370
嘿，你看的是什么？
Hey, what's that you're looking at?

858
01:02:53,970 --> 01:02:55,240
Oh...

859
01:02:55,370 --> 01:02:57,900
你在找人做变性手术吗？
Are you looking for someone to do your
sex change operation?

860
01:03:03,110 --> 01:03:06,150
你这小婊子……
You little fucking bitch...

861
01:03:10,550 --> 01:03:11,890
这就对了，母狗
That's right, bitches.

862
01:03:20,290 --> 01:03:22,240
天啊
God damn it.

863
01:03:32,800 --> 01:03:34,610
你怎么样？ 我没事。
Are you okay? I'm fine.

864
01:03:34,670 --> 01:03:36,650
- Peterson夫人？
- 是我
Mrs. Peterson?
Yes, that's right.

865
01:03:36,740 --> 01:03:38,910
Alston先生要见你，请进去吧
Mr. Alston will see you now. Please, step inside.

866
01:03:38,980 --> 01:03:40,650
等一下
Okay. Just a second.

867
01:03:43,980 --> 01:03:45,090
怎么了？
What happened?

868
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:49,090
这孩子叫我笨蛋
This kid called me a faggot,

869
01:03:51,260 --> 01:03:53,930
所以，我
so l, uh,

870
01:03:53,990 --> 01:03:55,970
在他脸上打断了尺子
broke a yardstick on his face.

871
01:03:58,630 --> 01:03:59,630
<i>Okay -</i>

872
01:04:00,600 --> 01:04:01,600
棒极了
Awesome.

873
01:04:07,040 --> 01:04:08,280
我跟你一起进去
I'll go in with you.

874
01:04:08,970 --> 01:04:09,970
<i>Okay -</i>

875
01:04:11,210 --> 01:04:13,210
从这儿进去？
Is it this way?
Yes.

876
01:04:14,610 --> 01:04:17,350
学校方面对于校园暴力是持零容忍态度的
Due to our school's zero tolerance
policy on violence,

877
01:04:17,450 --> 01:04:20,120
对于开除您儿子我恐怕没有第二个选择
I'm afraid we have no choice
but to expel your son.

878
01:04:20,790 --> 01:04:22,660
虽然还在等待董事会的决定
That's pending the decision of the board,

879
01:04:22,720 --> 01:04:24,530
但我觉得恐怕已经确定无疑了
but I'm afraid it's fairly certain.

880
01:04:25,120 --> 01:04:26,500
- 但…… - 我很抱歉
But...   I'm sorry.

881
01:04:27,390 --> 01:04:29,340
那孩子叫他什么？
What did the kid call him?

882
01:04:31,730 --> 01:04:32,730
什么？
What?

883
01:04:33,470 --> 01:04:35,390
你知道的，那孩子，Luke打了脸的那一个
You know, the kid, the one Luke hit in the face.

884
01:04:35,470 --> 01:04:37,000
他叫Luke什么？
What did he call Luke?

885
01:04:37,570 --> 01:04:39,480
我不认为跟此事有什么相关
I don't think that's relevant to this conversation.

886
01:04:39,540 --> 01:04:41,310
他是不是叫他笨蛋？
Did he call him a faggot?

887
01:04:43,810 --> 01:04:46,760
我相信确实是用了这个词，但那并非借口……
I believe that's the word that was
used, yes. But that's no excuse...

888
01:04:46,850 --> 01:04:48,760
不过，那造成了憎恨
So, that makes it a hate crime.

889
01:04:50,550 --> 01:04:52,650
- 什么？ - 憎恨
What? A hate crime.

890
01:04:53,990 --> 01:04:55,230
同时我也很想知道，还有多少其他孩子
And I'd like to know how many others

891
01:04:55,320 --> 01:04:58,230
在您的监督之下如此对待她的儿子
have been perpetrated against her son
under your watch.

892
01:04:58,990 --> 01:05:02,900
一个同性恋学生为了保护自己免受身体暴力的侵害
A gay student targeted with physical violence
finally defends himself,

893
01:05:02,990 --> 01:05:04,670
但您……什么？
and you're... What?

894
01:05:05,100 --> 01:05:06,200
开除他？
Suspending him?

895
01:05:08,070 --> 01:05:09,600
我们可以考虑开除
We could consider suspension.

896
01:05:09,700 --> 01:05:11,180
不，你不能
No. You couldn't.

897
01:05:12,340 --> 01:05:14,340
我倒有兴趣看看董事会如何处置您
I'll be interested to see what the board makes of you

898
01:05:14,410 --> 01:05:17,680
当这件事曝光于整个国家，更别说还有法律
when this is in front of the entire
country, not to mention our lawyers.

899
01:05:19,180 --> 01:05:20,920
你打算采取这方法吗？
Do you want to sue them?

900
01:05:21,110 --> 01:05:22,220
我……我不知道……
I... I don't, uh...

901
01:05:22,280 --> 01:05:24,020
我们将起诉你和学校董事会
We're suing you and the school board.

902
01:05:30,890 --> 01:05:32,560
我不知道他是同性恋
I didn't even know he was gay.

903
01:05:35,590 --> 01:05:37,400
留校察看怎么样？
What about after-school detention?

904
01:05:42,370 --> 01:05:43,540
多长时间？
For how long?

905
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:45,440
一个月
A month.

906
01:05:48,270 --> 01:05:49,480
看起来还算公平
That seems fair.

907
01:05:50,610 --> 01:05:51,780
留校察看
After-school detention.

908
01:05:51,880 --> 01:05:54,150
我会让他去做高中毕业舞会的准备工作
We'll put him to work helping the prom committee

909
01:05:54,250 --> 01:05:55,720
布置万圣节舞会
set up for the Halloween dance.

910
01:05:56,710 --> 01:05:58,130
好吧我们同意
We'll agree to that

911
01:05:59,920 --> 01:06:01,900
但是我不想接下来听到任何事
But I do not want to hear anything further

912
01:06:02,090 --> 01:06:03,720
关于这年轻人感到疲倦了
about this young man being harassed.

913
01:06:03,790 --> 01:06:05,060
我们是否说清楚了？
We understand each other?

914
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:07,670
我相信是的，先生……
I believe we do, Mr...

915
01:06:09,730 --> 01:06:11,140
你是谁？
Who are you?

916
01:06:11,230 --> 01:06:12,570
我是这家人的朋友
I'm a friend of the family.

917
01:06:25,580 --> 01:06:27,180
留校察看一个月
After-school detention for a month.

918
01:06:27,950 --> 01:06:28,980
就这样？ 是的
That's it?
Yeah.

919
01:06:31,850 --> 01:06:34,020
- 回头见   - 噢，David？
See you later.
Oh, David?

920
01:06:35,950 --> 01:06:37,150
我能跟你说几句吗？
Can I talk to you for a second?

921
01:06:38,590 --> 01:06:41,370
我跟Luke到走廊聊一会儿，没问题吧？
I'm going to step out into the hall
with Luke for a moment, if that's okay.

922
01:06:41,460 --> 01:06:42,530
噢，当然
Oh, certainly.

923
01:06:45,600 --> 01:06:47,670
所以，她认为是你杀了Craig
So, she thinks you killed Craig.

924
01:06:47,800 --> 01:06:49,300
并且打算去跟警察谈
And she's trying to make a case to the police

925
01:06:49,430 --> 01:06:51,640
警察就会让她男朋友出来
so they'll let her boyfriend go.

926
01:06:52,300 --> 01:06:54,210
- Anna告诉你的？  - 是的
Anna told you all this?
Yeah.

927
01:06:55,610 --> 01:06:57,140
你也认为是我杀了Craig？
Do you think I killed Craig?

928
01:06:57,640 --> 01:06:59,120
我不在乎
I don't care.

929
01:06:59,640 --> 01:07:01,350
这也就是为什么
But that's why

930
01:07:01,450 --> 01:07:03,520
他让我查查佛罗里达那个整容医生
she wanted me to check out that plastic
surgeon in Florida.

931
01:07:03,620 --> 01:07:05,360
她想知道你跟那儿有什么联系
She wanted to know what the connection was there.

932
01:07:05,450 --> 01:07:09,300
是啊，为什么我需要一个整容医生，对吧？
Yeah, I mean, why would I need
a plastic surgeon, right'?

933
01:07:09,390 --> 01:07:10,700
改变你的外貌？
To change your appearance.

934
01:07:11,120 --> 01:07:13,000
比如弄些骨头进去
Like, the bones in your face.

935
01:07:13,390 --> 01:07:16,170
或者打磨你的手指就不会留下指纹
And maybe scar up your fingers
so you don't have prints.

936
01:07:16,830 --> 01:07:19,040
至少我是这么想的
I mean, at least that's what I figured.

937
01:07:19,900 --> 01:07:21,570
我知道你不是真正的David Collins
I know you're not really David Collins,

938
01:07:21,670 --> 01:07:24,010
真正的可能就是Anna说的那样
I looked him up right after Anna said that.

939
01:07:24,140 --> 01:07:27,340
所以你可能不想让人知道你是谁
So, maybe you don't want people to know who you are.

940
01:07:27,540 --> 01:07:28,810
一个正好能干这些事的医生
A doctor who would do that sort of thing

941
01:07:28,870 --> 01:07:29,910
或许就是你想要的
is probably pretty rare.

942
01:07:30,010 --> 01:07:31,650
我意思，也可能不是这样
I mean, there's probably rules against it.

943
01:07:31,710 --> 01:07:34,850
或者那医生可能需要钱
But that doctor, well, I guess he needs the money,

944
01:07:34,910 --> 01:07:36,480
所以就做类似的事情
so he'd do that kind of work.

945
01:07:40,490 --> 01:07:42,330
这是个很有趣的理论
That's an interesting theory.

946
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:45,860
我没打算告诉任何人这事儿
I'm not going to tell anyone about it.

947
01:07:45,920 --> 01:07:47,400
没人会相信Anna
And nobody will believe Anna.

948
01:07:47,490 --> 01:07:49,200
她没有任何证据对抗你
She doesn't have anything against you.

949
01:07:51,700 --> 01:07:53,680
你也杀了爸爸的老板，对吧？
You killed Dad's boss, too, right?

950
01:07:55,330 --> 01:07:57,180
我不在乎，我不会说任何事
I don't care. I'm not going say anything.

951
01:07:57,740 --> 01:07:58,940
为什么不？
Why not?

952
01:08:01,010 --> 01:08:02,710
因为我们是朋友
Because we're friends.

953
01:08:04,610 --> 01:08:05,610
对吗？
Right?

954
01:08:08,680 --> 01:08:11,890
对，当然我们是
Yeah. Of course we are.

955
01:08:14,050 --> 01:08:15,290
<i>Okay -</i>

956
01:08:15,850 --> 01:08:17,390
我只想让你知道
I just wanted you to know.

957
01:08:22,290 --> 01:08:24,570
Anna有没有告诉其他人这件事？
Did Anna tell anyone else about this?

958
01:08:26,060 --> 01:08:27,480
不知道
I don't know.

959
01:08:27,900 --> 01:08:29,280
她的朋友，Dristen，可能？
Her friend, Kristen, maybe'?

960
01:08:30,900 --> 01:08:31,900
<i>Okay-</i>

961
01:08:33,570 --> 01:08:34,740
谢谢
Thank you.

962
01:08:49,550 --> 01:08:51,560
你知道，David，我真的……
You know, David, I really...

963
01:08:53,060 --> 01:08:54,430
想要谢谢你
I wanna thank you.

964
01:08:54,490 --> 01:08:57,170
如果你没来这儿，真不知道我会怎样
I don't know what I would have done
if you hadn't been here.

965
01:08:57,400 --> 01:09:00,140
我并非只说今天的事
And I don't... I don't mean just for today,

966
01:09:00,230 --> 01:09:03,240
我是说所有的事
I mean everything.

967
01:09:03,300 --> 01:09:06,150
我是……我是真心感谢
I am... I'm really grateful.

968
01:09:09,640 --> 01:09:11,620
真的，Peterson夫人，这没什么
Really, Mrs. Peterson. It's no problem.

969
01:09:15,250 --> 01:09:16,590
我得去歇会儿
I'll go get the rest.

970
01:09:18,620 --> 01:09:20,290
谢谢你，David
Thank you, David.

971
01:10:02,290 --> 01:10:04,830
请原谅，女士，你是Anna Peterson吗？
Excuse me, ma'am. Are you Anna Peterson?

972
01:10:05,060 --> 01:10:09,640
不是，她在餐馆工作
Uh, no. No, she's working at the diner.

973
01:10:09,800 --> 01:10:11,370
我是她妈妈
I'm her mother.

974
01:10:11,470 --> 01:10:13,540
她怎么……她做了什么？
What's she... Did she do something?

975
01:10:13,640 --> 01:10:14,840
不，没事，夫人
No, it's fine, ma'am.

976
01:10:14,910 --> 01:10:16,750
不过你女儿，她给我们打了电话
But your daughter, she put in a call to Fort Kennilworth

977
01:10:16,840 --> 01:10:19,380
几天以前，询问David Collins的事情
a couple of days ago asking about a man
named David Collins.

978
01:10:19,480 --> 01:10:21,320
对，是的，她打过电话
Yes. Oh, that's right, she did.

979
01:10:24,080 --> 01:10:25,390
你看见过什么人吗
You wouldn't happen to have seen anyone

980
01:10:25,480 --> 01:10:26,690
类似这个人，见过么？
resembling this man, would you?

981
01:10:29,590 --> 01:10:31,830
这是……David
This is, um... David.

982
01:10:35,990 --> 01:10:37,940
夫人，你最后何时看见他的？
Ma'am, when was the last time you saw him.

983
01:10:39,160 --> 01:10:42,200
噢，他刚刚进屋
Well, he just went inside.

984
01:11:32,720 --> 01:11:33,720
No!

985
01:11:33,790 --> 01:11:35,630
抓住那女人，回来这儿
Stop the girl! Get back here.

986
01:11:59,910 --> 01:12:00,910
抓住他
Get him!

987
01:12:28,940 --> 01:12:29,940
噢，妈的
Oh, shit!

988
01:13:17,820 --> 01:13:20,170
不不，噢，David，什么……
No, no, no, no. Ah! David, what...

989
01:13:20,520 --> 01:13:22,730
怎么回事，David？
What is happening, David?

990
01:13:22,830 --> 01:13:24,240
这些人是谁？
Who are those men?

991
01:13:24,330 --> 01:13:26,540
对此我真的抱歉，Peterson夫人
I really am sorry about this, Mrs. Peterson.

992
01:13:26,600 --> 01:13:28,840
恐怕我没有完全跟你说实话
I'm afraid I haven't been fully honest with you.

993
01:13:29,430 --> 01:13:30,540
你什么意思？
What do you mean?

994
01:13:32,100 --> 01:13:35,110
解释起来话就长了
It would take too long to explain.

995
01:13:38,380 --> 01:13:39,550
我想帮助你们
I wanted to help.

996
01:13:39,680 --> 01:13:42,160
我考虑当我在这儿时，我的任务是协助你们
I considered it my mission to assist you all
while I was here.

997
01:13:44,450 --> 01:13:47,190
只是事情太复杂了
There were just too many complications.

998
01:13:48,020 --> 01:13:49,260
你在说什么？
What are you talking about?

999
01:13:49,350 --> 01:13:52,130
David，为什么这些人想杀死你？
David, why are those men trying to kill you?

1000
01:13:52,520 --> 01:13:53,800
没关系
It doesn't matter.

1001
01:13:59,860 --> 01:14:01,140
你是……
Did you...

1002
01:14:02,470 --> 01:14:06,940
你真的认识我儿子？
Did you even know my son?

1003
01:14:09,070 --> 01:14:10,280
是的
I did.

1004
01:14:11,140 --> 01:14:12,280
Yes.

1005
01:14:13,310 --> 01:14:15,090
我们曾执行同一个计划
We were in the same program.

1006
01:14:15,580 --> 01:14:20,390
并且他明白我必须在这儿做什么
And he would understand what I have to do here.

1007
01:14:24,960 --> 01:14:26,490
他在这儿在……
He's here in the...

1008
01:14:36,130 --> 01:14:37,580
对不起
I'm sorry.

1009
01:14:43,470 --> 01:14:44,820
我要进去
I'm going in.

1010
01:14:45,080 --> 01:14:47,250
掩护我15秒，然后控制住
Give me 15 seconds of cover, then hold.

1011
01:15:18,980 --> 01:15:20,350
妈的
Fuck!

1012
01:15:43,400 --> 01:15:44,900
妈的
Fuck.

1013
01:15:58,720 --> 01:15:59,990
什么……
What the...

1014
01:16:01,720 --> 01:16:03,320
喔喔喔
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1015
01:16:37,920 --> 01:16:38,920
David.

1016
01:16:40,460 --> 01:16:42,600
对此我真的抱歉，先生
I'm really sorry about this, sir.

1017
01:17:31,110 --> 01:17:32,490
我想他死了
I think he's dead.

1018
01:17:32,810 --> 01:17:34,850
军事警察，我需要你的车
Military police.I'm gonna need
your vehicle.

1019
01:17:34,950 --> 01:17:35,980
什么？
What?

1020
01:17:36,080 --> 01:17:37,790
- 钥匙在车里吗？ - 是的，不过……
Are the keys in it?
Yes, but...

1021
01:17:58,540 --> 01:18:01,450
抱歉，你是Anna Peterson吗？
Excuse me, are you Anna Peterson?

1022
01:18:02,270 --> 01:18:03,310
Yes.

1023
01:18:03,810 --> 01:18:05,120
我是Major Carver
My name is Major Carver.

1024
01:18:05,180 --> 01:18:07,220
军事警察，我需要你跟我过来
Military police. I need you to come with me, please.

1025
01:18:07,950 --> 01:18:09,220
好的，发生什么了？
Okay. What's going on?

1026
01:18:09,310 --> 01:18:10,850
是关于David，Peterson小姐
It's about David, Miss Peterson.

1027
01:18:10,950 --> 01:18:12,110
他不是你想的那样
He is not who you think he is.

1028
01:18:12,120 --> 01:18:13,620
我们需要现在就走
And we need to go now.

1029
01:18:15,450 --> 01:18:16,450
<i>Okay -</i>

1030
01:18:18,220 --> 01:18:19,630
一切都好吗？
ls everything all right?

1031
01:18:20,020 --> 01:18:21,700
我想是的，我回头打给你，好吗？
I think so. I'll call you later, okay?

1032
01:18:21,790 --> 01:18:22,790
Peterson小姐
Miss Peterson.

1033
01:19:14,580 --> 01:19:16,790
Hey-
Hey.

1034
01:19:17,180 --> 01:19:18,390
Anna上班吗？
Is Anna working?

1035
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:20,730
哦，她刚走
Um, she just left.

1036
01:19:21,190 --> 01:19:22,260
Oh, yeah?

1037
01:19:22,690 --> 01:19:23,930
她去哪儿了？
Where was she going?

1038
01:19:24,860 --> 01:19:26,230
不太清楚
I'm not sure exactly.

1039
01:19:26,420 --> 01:19:27,930
去接Luke吗？
To pick up Luke?

1040
01:19:28,690 --> 01:19:29,900
Um...

1041
01:19:30,090 --> 01:19:31,540
我想她是要去……
I think that she's going...

1042
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:32,600
没关系
Never mind.

1043
01:20:09,400 --> 01:20:10,610
什么？
What?

1044
01:20:12,070 --> 01:20:13,980
好的，明白，我们这就出发
Okay. Copy. We're on our way.

1045
01:20:15,610 --> 01:20:16,740
什么？
What?

1046
01:20:16,910 --> 01:20:19,320
我们得去REC中心接你弟弟
We're going to the REC center
to get your brother.

1047
01:20:19,410 --> 01:20:20,680
警察不能派车过去
The police couldn't send a car there.

1048
01:20:20,780 --> 01:20:21,950
他们说正忙着
They've got their hands full.

1049
01:20:22,950 --> 01:20:25,260
好的，你必须告诉我怎么回事
Okay. You need to tell me what's going on.

1050
01:20:25,620 --> 01:20:27,030
你是谁？
Who are you?

1051
01:20:27,580 --> 01:20:28,860
什么？你是为了David过来？
What? You came here for David?

1052
01:20:28,990 --> 01:20:30,160
Yes.

1053
01:20:32,990 --> 01:20:34,300
你认识的那个叫David的士兵
The soldier you know as David

1054
01:20:34,360 --> 01:20:36,360
是个正在接受医学实验项目的人
was one of the subjects of a medical experiment.

1055
01:20:37,930 --> 01:20:40,270
我们正在对他进行研究，但他杀了几个人跑了
While we had him under study,he killed several peopleand escaped.

1056
01:20:40,360 --> 01:20:42,310
他烧了尸体迷惑我们
Then he burned their bodies to confuse us.

1057
01:20:42,370 --> 01:20:44,050
我们以为他也死在火中
We thought he'd died in the fire initially.

1058
01:20:44,100 --> 01:20:45,510
那是我们还以为他完了
By the time we figured out what he'd done,

1059
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:46,600
没留下什么痕迹
the trail was cold.

1060
01:20:46,770 --> 01:20:47,840
或许你不应该
Maybe you shouldn't have tested

1061
01:20:47,940 --> 01:20:49,350
用精神病患者做实验
your procedures on a psychopath.

1062
01:20:49,770 --> 01:20:51,780
各方面看，他都是个完美的士兵
By all accounts, he was an ideal soldier.

1063
01:20:54,610 --> 01:20:55,610
我不知道
I don't know.

1064
01:20:56,710 --> 01:20:58,350
我需要给我弟弟打电话
I need to call my brother.

1065
01:21:03,520 --> 01:21:05,860
Peterson先生，那是手机吗？
Mr. Peterson, is that a cell phone?

1066
01:21:06,790 --> 01:21:08,460
我不是说过“关机”吗？
Didn't I say, "Phones off“?

1067
01:21:10,230 --> 01:21:11,300
交给我
Hand it over.

1068
01:21:12,200 --> 01:21:13,870
下课后再来拿
You can have it back after detention.

1069
01:21:17,230 --> 01:21:19,650
Luke，听到留言给我打电话
Luke, I need you to call me
when you get this.

1070
01:21:19,700 --> 01:21:21,180
好吗，这很重要
Okay? It's important.

1071
01:21:31,320 --> 01:21:33,060
警车这是去哪儿？
Where are those cop cars going?

1072
01:21:33,650 --> 01:21:36,060
你离开后有人袭击了你工作的餐馆
Somebody attacked your diner
right after we left it.

1073
01:21:36,820 --> 01:21:38,600
说是发生了爆炸
It was called in as an explosion.

1074
01:21:41,020 --> 01:21:42,770
有人活下来吗
Is anyone alive?

1075
01:21:43,060 --> 01:21:44,230
不知道
I don't know.

1076
01:21:44,600 --> 01:21:47,600
有人想制造混乱让警察保持忙碌
It's possible that he'd leave some wounded
to keep them busy.

1077
01:21:49,200 --> 01:21:50,910
等等，我父母在哪儿？
Wait. Where are my parents?

1078
01:21:51,600 --> 01:21:53,710
你还没提到过我的父母
You haven't said anything about my parents.

1079
01:21:57,670 --> 01:21:59,120
他们都死了
They're both dead.

1080
01:22:00,180 --> 01:22:02,050
在我们阻止之前他杀了他们
He killed them before we could stop him.

1081
01:22:03,250 --> 01:22:04,690
对不起
I'm sorry.

1082
01:22:06,420 --> 01:22:07,950
<i>No.</i>

1083
01:22:09,090 --> 01:22:11,930
David的神经可以自我调节，Peterson小姐
David has neurological conditioning, Miss Peterson,

1084
01:22:12,060 --> 01:22:14,630
旨在保护他和实验成果
designed to protect both him and the experiment.

1085
01:22:16,290 --> 01:22:18,860
如果他觉得事情可能败露
If he feels like his identity may be compromised,

1086
01:22:21,270 --> 01:22:23,710
他会程序化地清除所有麻烦
he's programmed to clean up all loose ends.

1087
01:22:24,400 --> 01:22:27,610
我怀疑如果需要，他是不会让自己停下来的
I doubt he could stop himself now
even if he wanted to.

1088
01:22:29,040 --> 01:22:31,990
这就是为什么，我们需要把你和你弟弟接到安全的地方
It's why we need to get you and your brother
somewhere safe.

1089
01:22:55,300 --> 01:22:57,070
Peterson小姐，我们得走了
Miss Peterson, we need to go.

1090
01:23:00,740 --> 01:23:01,740
Peterson小姐
Miss Peterson?

1091
01:23:02,810 --> 01:23:04,080
Uh...

1092
01:23:05,740 --> 01:23:07,620
是的，去接我弟弟
Yeah, let's go get my brother.

1093
01:23:32,640 --> 01:23:33,940
这是什么鬼地方？
What the hell is this?

1094
01:23:35,270 --> 01:23:37,810
秋季舞会，他们做的万圣节迷宫
For the fall dance, they do this Halloween maze thing.

1095
01:23:38,780 --> 01:23:40,350
跟紧我
Stay close to me.

1096
01:24:03,470 --> 01:24:06,040
妈的，里面是什么？
God damn it! What in the hell?

1097
01:24:06,140 --> 01:24:07,670
谁在那儿？
Who's in here?

1098
01:24:09,140 --> 01:24:10,710
军事警察
Military police!

1099
01:24:10,810 --> 01:24:11,890
我是来找Luke Peterson
I'm here for Luke Peterson.

1100
01:24:11,980 --> 01:24:13,480
怎么才能通过这个迷宫？
How do I get through this maze?

1101
01:24:14,550 --> 01:24:17,990
左，右，右，左，左
Left, right, right, left, left,

1102
01:24:18,150 --> 01:24:20,530
右，左，然后直走
right, left, then straight.

1103
01:24:20,680 --> 01:24:21,690
明白？
Got it?

1104
01:24:21,890 --> 01:24:22,890
Yeah.

1105
01:24:47,040 --> 01:24:48,050
- Luke   - 对不起……
Luke! Uh, excuse me.

1106
01:24:48,110 --> 01:24:50,020
你们刚打断了他的拘留过程
But you're interrupting detention right now.

1107
01:24:51,350 --> 01:24:52,920
你们到底是谁？
Who are you exactly?

1108
01:24:55,920 --> 01:24:56,950
怎么回事？
What's going on?

1109
01:24:57,050 --> 01:24:58,690
我们得走，你姐姐……
We need to go. Your sister...

1110
01:24:59,620 --> 01:25:00,620
哦，妈的
Oh, shit.

1111
01:25:11,370 --> 01:25:12,490
还有谁在这儿？
Who else is in here?

1112
01:25:12,540 --> 01:25:13,610
没人，就我们俩
No one. It's just us two.

1113
01:25:13,700 --> 01:25:14,880
控制灯的开关在哪儿？
Where are the lights controlled from?

1114
01:25:14,940 --> 01:25:16,250
控制盒在后面
There's a DJ booth in the back.

1115
01:25:17,540 --> 01:25:19,920
我们得离开这儿，马上。后门在哪儿？
We need to get out of here. Now.
Where's the back exit?

1116
01:25:20,040 --> 01:25:21,820
这边，跟着我
It's this way. Uh, follow me.

快跑！去另外一边，走

1121
01:26:39,390 --> 01:26:40,630
你好，长官
Hello, sir.

1122
01:27:22,170 --> 01:27:24,110
你不应该来找我
You shouldn't have followed me.

1123
01:27:25,170 --> 01:27:27,170
我不知道你期望什么
I don't know what you expected.

1124
01:27:33,580 --> 01:27:34,680
妈的
Shit.

1125
01:27:34,750 --> 01:27:37,590
Anna，我不知道怎么回事，但David不会伤害我们的
Anna, I don't know what's going on,

1130
01:28:14,750 --> 01:28:15,820
你得藏在这儿，好吗？
I need you to hide in here. Okay?

1131
01:28:15,990 --> 01:28:17,290
什么？不
What? No way.

1132
01:28:17,420 --> 01:28:19,760
Anna，你看，David只是个才离开军队的家伙
Anna, look, David was probably
just after that army guy.

1133
01:28:19,820 --> 01:28:20,930
让我们只是……
Let's just...

1134
01:28:21,090 --> 01:28:22,260
跟他谈谈
Let's go talk to him.

1135
01:28:22,730 --> 01:28:23,730
Luke.

1136
01:28:25,830 --> 01:28:27,670
他杀了妈妈和爸爸
He killed Mom and Dad.

1137
01:28:29,670 --> 01:28:32,080
不，他不会，你是乱说的
No, he didn't. You're just saying that.

1138
01:28:35,810 --> 01:28:37,110
什么？
What?

1139
01:28:40,080 --> 01:28:41,750
妈妈和爸爸是……
Mom and Dad are...

1140
01:28:42,610 --> 01:28:44,180
Please, Luke.

1141
01:28:44,410 --> 01:28:46,360
好吧，你得藏在这里
Okay, you need to hide in there.

1142
01:28:47,120 --> 01:28:48,690
我去把他引开
I'm going to lead him away.

1143
01:28:48,850 --> 01:28:51,990
除非听见是我或者警察，否则别出来
You can't come out unless you hear me or the police.

1144

我会回来找你的

1145

我讨厌采取其他方式

1147
01:29:23,820 --> 01:29:25,730
或者其他办法
Any other solution.

1148
01:29:36,500 --> 01:29:37,500
Luke!

1149
01:29:40,800 --> 01:29:42,580

1150
01:29:48,550 --> 01:29:50,320
我不会伤害你

是的
I did.

1153
01:31:31,580 --> 01:31:32,580
Yes.

1154
01:32:11,190 --> 01:32:12,460
<i>Ow!</i>

1155
01:32:30,240 --> 01:32:33,710
别挣扎了，很快就完事
Stop it. It'll be over in a second.

1156
01:32:52,760 --> 01:32:53,930

01:33:55,390 --> 01:33:56,630
谢谢你

1161
01:33:57,060 --> 01:33:58,270
你好吗
You okay?

1162
01:33:58,330 --> 01:33:59,500
是的，你呢？
Yeah. Are you?

1163
01:34:00,330 --> 01:34:01,640

收到

1169
01:34:58,450 --> 01:34:59,870
怎么了？
What's the deal?

1170
01:34:59,960 --> 01:35:01,330
应该有两具尸体在里面
Guess there's two bodies inside,

1171
01:35:01,390 --> 01:35:02,870
都烧的不成样子
both of them pretty badly burned.

1172
01:35:02,960 --> 01:35:04,960
一个家伙说，他们的牙齿都没了
One of the guys said their teeth are missing,

1173
01:35:05,030 --> 01:35:07,130
糊涂了，所以我不知道是咋回事
got knocked out, so I don't know what the deal is.

1174
01:35:07,300 --> 01:35:08,830
一旦清理干净，你就能进去了
As soon <i>as we get the all clear,
you can go in.</i>

1175
01:35:08,900 --> 01:35:09,900

01:35:40,530 --> 01:35:41,910
怎么回事！
What the fuck!
