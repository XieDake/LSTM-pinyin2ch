00:01:09,605 --> 00:01:12,691
我说不出是什么使我爱上越南
Ican't say what made me fall in love with Vietnam.

3
00:01:14,735 --> 00:01:17,738
因为这的女人声音使人迷醉?
That a woman's voice can drug you?

4
00:01:17,905 --> 00:01:21,492
因为这的一切都很热情?
That everything is so intense -

5
00:01:22,743 --> 00:01:24,662
颜色
the colours,

6
00:01:24,828 --> 00:01:26,580
气味
the taste,

7
00:01:26,747 --> 00:01:28,749
甚至这儿的雨?
even the rain?

8
00:01:28,916 --> 00:01:31,752
这儿的雨可不像伦敦那可恶的雨
Nothing like the filthy rain in London.

9
00:01:39,468 --> 00:01:42,304
片名: 安静的美国人

10
00:01:42,930 --> 00:01:45,099
越南西贡,1952 人们说不管你寻求什么
They say whatever you're looking for

11
00:01:45,265 --> 00:01:47,935
你都能在这儿如愿以偿
you will find here.

12
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:49,937
人们说来到越南
They say you come to Vietnam

13
00:01:50,104 --> 00:01:52,773
你能立刻明白很多事
and you understand a lot in a few minutes.

14
00:01:52,898 --> 00:01:57,820
剩下的你得自己去经历
But the rest has got to be lived.

15
00:01:57,987 --> 00:02:00,280
首先是气味 -
The smell, that's the first thing that hits you -

16
00:02:00,447 --> 00:02:03,951
预示着你用灵魂交换的一切
promising everything in exchange for your soul.

17
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:08,580
然后是热天气
And the heat.

18
00:02:08,747 --> 00:02:11,000
你的衣服马上变得不像样
Your shirt is straight away a rag.

19
00:02:11,166 --> 00:02:13,877
你会记不起自己的名字
You can hardly remember your name,

20
00:02:14,044 --> 00:02:16,714
或是你来这是逃避什么的
or what you came to escape from.

21
00:02:18,632 --> 00:02:21,385
不过在晚上,这儿凉风悉悉
But at night, there's a breeze.

22
00:02:21,552 --> 00:02:24,847
这的河美极了
The river is beautiful.

23
00:02:25,014 --> 00:02:28,267
没有战争,那些枪声只是烟花
You could be forgiven for thinking there was no war,

24
00:02:28,434 --> 00:02:30,811
这些自欺欺人的想法都会被谅解
that the gunshots were fireworks,

25
00:02:30,978 --> 00:02:33,355
只有享乐最重要
that only pleasure matters.

26
00:02:33,522 --> 00:02:36,567
抽斗鸦片
A pipe of opium,

27
00:02:36,734 --> 00:02:40,362
或抚摸那说爱你的女人
or the touch of a girl who might tell you she loves you.

28
00:02:44,533 --> 00:02:47,119
然而有些事还是发生了
And then something happens,

29
00:02:47,286 --> 00:02:49,204
你知道那会发生
as you knew it would,

30
00:02:49,371 --> 00:02:52,499
然后一切都改变了
and nothing can ever be the same again.

31
00:02:55,252 --> 00:02:57,296
福勒先生
Monsieur Fowler.

32
00:02:57,463 --> 00:02:59,506
感谢你亲自过来
Thank you for coming in.

33
00:02:59,673 --> 00:03:02,343
很抱歉这时候打挠你
I'm sorry to ask you at this hour.

34
00:03:03,677 --> 00:03:05,804
我知道的不比你多
I know about as much as you do.

35
00:03:05,971 --> 00:03:07,848
他是美国人,大约30岁
He's an American. He's about 30.

36
00:03:08,015 --> 00:03:10,059
他为经济援助团工作
He works for the Economic Aid Mission.

37
00:03:10,225 --> 00:03:12,144
我喜欢他
And I like him.

38
00:03:12,311 --> 00:03:15,272
他是个不错的小伙子,说真的
He's a very good chap. Serious.

39
00:03:15,439 --> 00:03:20,194
不像其他欧洲饭店里吵闹的混球
Not like those noisy bastards down at the Continental.

40
00:03:20,361 --> 00:03:22,446
他很安静
He's a quiet American.

41
00:03:22,613 --> 00:03:26,533
是的,一个非常安静的美国人
Yes. A very quiet American.

42
00:03:28,619 --> 00:03:31,288
他死了,是吗?
He's dead, isn't he?

43
00:03:32,956 --> 00:03:36,919
不是做贼心虚 我只是根据事实推测
Not guilty. I just put two and two together.

44
00:04:01,944 --> 00:04:04,446
他被刀捅死的
He was killed by a knife.

45
00:04:07,908 --> 00:04:10,327
你能辨认出他吗?
Can you identify him?

46
00:04:11,537 --> 00:04:12,913
是的
Yes.

47
00:04:13,580 --> 00:04:16,500
他是...我的朋友
He was... a friend.

48
00:04:18,002 --> 00:04:21,046
老实说我并不怎么为他悲哀
To tell you the truth, I'm not completely sorry.

49
00:04:21,213 --> 00:04:24,258
这些美国人给我们惹了不少麻烦
These Americans are causing a lot of trouble to us.

50
00:04:25,676 --> 00:04:28,595
不过这始终是凶杀案
But still, a murder is a murder.

51
00:04:28,762 --> 00:04:31,056
能提供什么线索吗?
Anything to help us?

52
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:34,310
没有
No.

53
00:04:34,476 --> 00:04:36,520
一点线索也没
Nothing at all.

54
00:04:40,357 --> 00:04:42,109
那请吧
Please.

55
00:06:03,232 --> 00:06:05,275
派尔...
Pyle...

56
00:06:10,406 --> 00:06:12,241
他死了
est mort.

57
00:06:17,579 --> 00:06:20,040
被暗杀了
Assassinated.

58
00:06:24,378 --> 00:06:26,338
怎么死的?
How?

59
00:06:28,048 --> 00:06:29,883
被刀捅死的
He was stabbed.

60
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:44,398
是的

61
00:06:46,984 --> 00:06:49,570
他很爱我
He was in love with me.

62
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:53,699
是的,的确
Yes. He was.

63
00:06:57,870 --> 00:06:59,913
我很抱歉,凤
I'm so sorry, Phuong.

64
00:07:03,667 --> 00:07:06,253
我回我妈那儿
I go to my mother's.

65
00:07:10,632 --> 00:07:12,635
我得静一静
I must think.

66
00:07:25,022 --> 00:07:27,191
我是在欧洲旅馆里见到派尔的 -
I met Pyle where you meet everybody -

67
00:07:27,358 --> 00:07:29,068
在那儿你能遇到很多人
at the Hotel Continental.

68
00:07:29,234 --> 00:07:32,029
我每天上午11点都会在那儿
I'm there every morning at 1 1. 00.

69
00:07:32,196 --> 00:07:36,492
我是英国人,我有去喝茶的习惯
I'm English. I have habits. I drink tea.

70
00:07:36,659 --> 00:07:39,662
我是个记者,所以听听小道消息
I'm a reporter, so I listen.

71
00:07:39,828 --> 00:07:45,626
我有个情人 我喜欢看着她和朋友走进饮料吧
I have a lover. I like to watch her arrive at the milk bar.

72
00:07:47,127 --> 00:07:49,254
我在那看到艾登.派尔
And there was Alden Pyle.

73
00:07:49,421 --> 00:07:51,799
看到他年青正直的脸
A face with no history and no problems.

74
00:07:51,965 --> 00:07:53,884
我们都曾有过这样一张脸
The face we all had once.

75
00:07:54,051 --> 00:07:56,178
- 我叫艾登.派尔 -我叫托马斯.福勒
- I'm Alden Pyle. - I'm Thomas Fowler.

76
00:07:56,345 --> 00:07:59,807
- 你是伦敦时报的 - 你知道很多嘛
- The London Times. - You've done your homework.

77
00:07:59,974 --> 00:08:01,642
我读过你的文章
I've read your articles.

78
00:08:01,809 --> 00:08:03,769
- 我能坐这吗? - 请
- May I join you? - Please.

79
00:08:03,936 --> 00:08:07,064
你来西贡做什么,派尔先生?
And what brings you to Saigon, Mr Pyle?

80
00:08:07,231 --> 00:08:10,234
我是经济援助团的 负责医疗方面
I'm with the Economic Aid Mission, on the medical side.

81
00:08:10,401 --> 00:08:15,072
眼疾.你知道沙眼吗? 这病在这很普遍,实事上很容易治
Eye disease. Do know trachoma? It's very common here. Very easy to treat.

82
00:08:15,239 --> 00:08:19,076
- 你住在旅店? - 只是顺便过来喝杯茶
- Are you staying at the hotel? - No. I just dropped by for tea.

83
00:08:19,243 --> 00:08:20,828
我要经过这去上班
On the way to the office.

84
00:08:20,995 --> 00:08:23,372
能见到你真是意外的好运
This is really a stroke of luck for me.

85
00:08:23,539 --> 00:08:25,499
你是少数几个...
You're one of the few correspondents

86
00:08:25,666 --> 00:08:28,711
能深入战场了解事实真相的通讯员之一
who goes out into the field to see what's happening.

87
00:08:28,877 --> 00:08:33,674
不再是了. 而且我不认为自己是通讯员
Not any more. Besides, I have never thought of myself as a correspondent.

88
00:08:33,841 --> 00:08:36,635
我只是个记者,我没有自己的观点
I'm just a reporter. I offer no point of view.

89
00:08:36,802 --> 00:08:39,263
我不采取行动 也不参与行动
I take no action. I don't get involved.

90
00:08:39,430 --> 00:08:41,181
我只是报道我所看到的
I just report what I see.

91
00:08:41,348 --> 00:08:45,352
- 但是你总有想法吧 - 就算想法也是一种行动.
- But you must have an opinion. - Even an opinion is a form of action.

92
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:46,812
我还是...
Still, I'd appreciate...

93
00:08:46,979 --> 00:08:49,690
派尔渴望知道越南的一切
Pyle was hungry for everything I could tell him about Vietnam

94
00:08:49,857 --> 00:08:52,067
越南的独立战争
and her fight for independence.

95
00:08:52,234 --> 00:08:54,945
为什么法国人打了败仗?
Why were the French losing the war?

96
00:08:55,112 --> 00:08:57,239
为什么共产党赢了?
And why were the communists winning?

97
00:08:59,199 --> 00:09:01,452
然后他见到凤
Then he saw Phuong.

98
00:09:03,620 --> 00:09:07,166
我当时就该意识到对派尔这样的人而言
I should have realised how saving a country and saving a woman

99
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:10,002
拯救一个女子和拯救一个国家一样重要
could be the same thing to someone like Pyle.

100
00:09:10,169 --> 00:09:12,671
我们得遏制共产主义
We've got to contain communism.

101
00:09:12,838 --> 00:09:14,965
我们能做到
What could be done, what should be done,

102
00:09:15,132 --> 00:09:17,718
他的思想,他读的书
what he thought, what he'd read.

103
00:09:17,885 --> 00:09:19,970
他使我记起
He made me remember there was a time

104
00:09:20,137 --> 00:09:22,181
曾经我也有远大抱负
when I had wanted to make a difference.

105
00:09:22,348 --> 00:09:25,476
- 就这么看着他们失去自由吗? - "自由" 是个西式词语
- T o watch liberty snuffed out? - "Liberty" is a western word.

106
00:09:25,643 --> 00:09:28,103
你认为越南人的自由是什么?
How do you define it for the Vietnamese?

107
00:09:28,228 --> 00:09:30,022
自由选择权
The freedom to choose.

108
00:09:30,189 --> 00:09:34,234
你给他们选择权 他们会投票选胡志明
OK, you give them that, they vote and they elect Ho Chi Minh.

109
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:36,904
事实往往比它看起来要复杂
Things are more complicated than they seem.

110
00:09:38,405 --> 00:09:40,532
- 那是什么? -手榴弹
- What was that? - A grenade.

111
00:09:42,034 --> 00:09:45,621
- 听上去像汽车逆火 - 在这呆一个星期,你就能听出不同来
- It sounded like a car backfiring. - A week here, you'll know the difference.

112
00:09:45,788 --> 00:09:48,040
见到你真的很高兴
It's been a genuine pleasure meeting you.

113
00:09:48,165 --> 00:09:51,001
- 也许我们能一起吃个饭 - 我很期待
- Maybe we could eat dinner. - I look forward to it.

114
00:09:51,168 --> 00:09:52,586
好极了
Great.

115
00:09:52,753 --> 00:09:54,046
早安
Good morning.

116
00:09:57,966 --> 00:10:00,928
早安,辛.有什么新闻吗?
Morning, Hinh. Anything new?

117
00:10:01,095 --> 00:10:04,473
腐败,造假...
Oh, corruption, mendacity...

118
00:10:04,598 --> 00:10:06,350
我说了"新"闻
I said new.

119
00:10:06,517 --> 00:10:08,310
有谣言说...
There is a rumour that the communists

120
00:10:08,477 --> 00:10:11,480
共产党计划要袭击北部的Phat Diem.
are planning an attack in the north, at Phat Diem.

121
00:10:11,647 --> 00:10:13,774
你的线人说的?
One of your contacts?

122
00:10:14,858 --> 00:10:16,902

- 伦敦办事处发来的 - 史达明先生

125
00:10:23,325 --> 00:10:26,996
他说报社回顾了外国办事处的情况

127

我以为你喜欢伦敦,先生

130
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:40,968
为什么? 办事处差事?
For what? A desk job?

131
00:10:41,093 --> 00:10:42,928
也许他们认为...
They probably think it's cheaper

132
00:10:43,053 --> 00:10:45,472
让通讯社覆盖越南会更便宜
to let the wire services cover Vietnam.

133

我们一共交过几篇报道?

- 哪儿,先生? - Phat Diem.

他们不让我的车开过金边
They wouldn't let my truck out of Phnom Penh

289

296
00:26:00,804 --> 00:26:01,764
这边走
This way.

297
00:26:01,930 --> 00:26:04,808
''事不关己不是那么容易的 ''
"Not that easy to remain uninvolved. "

298
00:26:08,646 --> 00:26:11,690
我躲在打字机后太久了
I had hidden for so long behind a typewriter.

299
00:26:14,652 --> 00:26:20,032
我们在 Phat Diem所见所闻
What we found there, what we saw, in Phat Diem.

300
00:26:20,199 --> 00:26:22,576
那意味这什么?
What did that do?

301
00:26:24,286 --> 00:26:27,081
他的热诚,我的冷漠?
To his zeal, to my detachment?

302
00:26:28,374 --> 00:26:30,584
死人就事不关己了
The dead are not involved.

303
00:26:31,710 --> 00:26:34,380
死人没有热诚
The dead have no zeal.

304
00:26:34,505 --> 00:26:37,383
他们躺着等待
They are lying in wait.

305
00:26:37,549 --> 00:26:41,804
你看见他们,他们的惨状
You see them, all their tenderness,

306
00:26:42,805 --> 00:26:45,224
荤绕在你心头,挥之不去
and then they haunt you.

307
00:26:46,684 --> 00:26:50,479
- 共产党人干的? - 这不是法国士兵干的
- Communists? - This is not the work of French soldiers.

308
00:26:51,397 --> 00:26:54,066
这不合情理
It doesn't make sense.

309
00:26:54,233 --> 00:26:57,361
共产党人不杀平民
The communists don't kill townspeople.

310
00:26:57,528 --> 00:27:01,991
- 他们犯不着这样 - 也许是另一个党派干的
- It is not in their interest. - Maybe another faction.

311
00:27:02,157 --> 00:27:04,243
这有那么多党派
There are so many of them.

312
00:27:05,202 --> 00:27:07,538
每个党派都有自己的军队
Each with their own army.

313
00:27:20,092 --> 00:27:22,136
你总在看的那本是什么书?
What's that book you're always reading?

314
00:27:22,303 --> 00:27:24,972
约克.哈丁 民主的威胁
York Harding. The Dangers To Democracy.

315
00:27:25,139 --> 00:27:27,725
- 美国作家? - 是的
- An American? - Yeah.

316
00:27:27,891 --> 00:27:30,269
他在这儿呆了几年才回去
He was out here a couple of years back.

317
00:27:30,436 --> 00:27:32,896
- 他呆了很久吗? - 我不知道
- Was he here long? - I don't know.

318
00:27:33,063 --> 00:27:35,566
我听过他的一次演讲 乔见过他
I heard him lecture once. Joe actually met him.

319
00:27:35,733 --> 00:27:38,610
他提出由第三方力量来控制越南
He put forward the idea of a third force to run Vietnam.

320
00:27:38,777 --> 00:27:41,947
- 不是共产党,不是法国人 - 不是美国人?
- Not the communists and not the French. - Not the Americans?

321
00:27:42,114 --> 00:27:44,408
不,我们可不是殖民主义者
No. We're not colonialists.

322
00:27:44,575 --> 00:27:47,119
有时那反而能真得帮助这些人
Something that could really help these people.

323
00:27:47,286 --> 00:27:50,706
- 你们谁有枪吗? - 没有
- You have a gun, either of you? - No.

324
00:27:50,873 --> 00:27:53,375
他们今晚会进攻这里
They shall attack again tonight.

325
00:27:53,542 --> 00:27:55,919
你不会想被活捉的
You don't want to be taken alive.

326
00:27:56,086 --> 00:27:58,213
相信我
Believe me.

327
00:27:59,548 --> 00:28:01,550
必要时自行了断吧
Shoot yourselves.

328
00:28:02,509 --> 00:28:04,303
- 谢谢
- Thank you. - Thanks.

329
00:28:04,470 --> 00:28:07,056
呆在碉堡里
Stay inside that bunker.

330
00:28:21,904 --> 00:28:24,907
- 想吃点吗? - 不,谢谢
- Do you want something to eat? - No, thank you.

331
00:28:26,742 --> 00:28:29,286
说吧
Come on.

332
00:28:29,453 --> 00:28:32,289
你来这不是为了医疗队
You didn't come up to check your medical team.

333
00:28:32,956 --> 00:28:36,543
乔.滕尼派你来的,是不是? 收信点情报
Joe Tunney sent you, right? A little intelligence work.

334
00:28:42,091 --> 00:28:45,427
我总是藏不住秘密
I've never have been very good at keeping secrets.

335
00:28:45,594 --> 00:28:49,139
我来这还有个原因
There is another reason why I came up here.

336
00:28:52,393 --> 00:28:55,562
- 为了你 - 我?
- It's you. - Me?

337
00:28:57,231 --> 00:28:58,565
是的
Yeah.

338
00:29:00,317 --> 00:29:02,987
你说过你可能来这儿
You said that you might be coming up here.

339
00:29:13,622 --> 00:29:15,249
我想说的是, 有关凤的
The thing is, it's about Phuong.

340
00:29:17,084 --> 00:29:20,004
呃,从那晚我们第一次见面
Well, I guess it started that night when we were

341
00:29:20,170 --> 00:29:22,506
在 Arc en Ciel,我和她跳舞
at the Arc en Ciel and I was dancing with her.

342
00:29:23,257 --> 00:29:25,759
我不认为你们会有近一步关系
I didn't think you ever got close enough.

343
00:29:25,926 --> 00:29:29,346
然后我和她还有她姐姐一起吃饭
And then I had dinner with her and her sister

344
00:29:31,432 --> 00:29:33,600
那个周六...
that Saturday and...

345
00:29:35,311 --> 00:29:39,356
当我坐在那儿看着她
just when I was sitting there looking at her,

346
00:29:40,899 --> 00:29:42,901
一切在我看来都再清楚不过了
it all just became so clear to me.

347
00:29:43,068 --> 00:29:45,279
我明白
I see.

348
00:29:45,446 --> 00:29:47,740
听着,托马斯, 我不是有预谋这样的
Look, Tom, none of this was planned.

349
00:29:47,906 --> 00:29:49,742
不可能...
There's no way...

350
00:29:49,908 --> 00:29:54,163
我从不相信一见钟情
I never ever used to believe in love at first sight.

351
00:29:54,747 --> 00:29:57,207
但是自从见到那可怕的地方的那些女子
But after seeing those other girls in that awful place

352
00:29:57,374 --> 00:30:01,045
并且想到凤很可能变成她们中的一个
and thinking that Phuong could easily become one of them,

353
00:30:02,212 --> 00:30:03,672
我想保护她
I want to protect her.

354
00:30:03,839 --> 00:30:06,550
你想保护她时她怎么说?
What did she say when you offered her your protection?

355
00:30:06,717 --> 00:30:08,886
- 我还没告诉她 - 你还没?
- I haven't told her yet. - You haven't?

356
00:30:09,053 --> 00:30:12,264
没.我觉得那样不妥 我想先告诉你
No. I didn't think it would be right. I wanted to speak with you first.

357
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:18,354
听着,如果你们俩结婚了,那情况会完全不同
Look, if you two were married that would be completely different.

358
00:30:18,520 --> 00:30:20,773
我不可能和她结婚 噢,该死!
I can never marry her. Oh, shit!

359
00:30:20,939 --> 00:30:24,026
我妻子不可能同意离婚 她是天主教徒
My wife would never give me a divorce. She's a Catholic.

360
00:30:28,197 --> 00:30:31,659
他们靠近了,他们开进来了
They're getting closer. They're walking in.

361
00:30:54,765 --> 00:30:58,519
亲爱的托马斯 我想我会比你早回西贡
Dear Thomas - I guess I'll be back in Saigon ahead of you.

362
00:30:58,686 --> 00:31:02,231
我再次向你保证
And I wanted to reassure you

363
00:31:02,398 --> 00:31:06,110
直到你回来,我不会见凤
that I won't go to see Phuong until after you return.

364
00:31:06,276 --> 00:31:10,572
如果你能赶上下一次出城 你将会在这周末回来
If you can make the next transport out, you should be back by the end of the week.

365
00:31:11,782 --> 00:31:14,994
我会向你的助手打听你的消息
I can check in with your assistant to see if you made it.

366
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:19,248
如果你赶上了,我会在周五来见你
If so, I'll come around to see you both together on Friday.

367
00:31:19,415 --> 00:31:21,375
 5.00行吗?
Say 5. 00?

368
00:31:22,459 --> 00:31:24,253
有人要去香港吗?
Anyone due to go out to Hong Kong?

369
00:31:24,420 --> 00:31:26,839
我想路透社的人会去
Someone from Reuters, I believe.

370
00:31:27,006 --> 00:31:29,883
把这个打出来,叫他帮我发到伦敦去
Type this up and ask him to cable it to London for me.

371
00:31:30,050 --> 00:31:31,969
- 你的大新闻? - 是的
- Your big story? - Yes.

372
00:31:32,136 --> 00:31:35,556
Phat Diem大屠杀 不知道谁干的
Massacre at Phat Diem. Nobody did it, of course.

373
00:31:35,723 --> 00:31:37,975
不是法国人,不是共产党...
Not the French, not the communists...

374
00:31:38,892 --> 00:31:40,728
只有各种谣传
But there are rumours.

375
00:31:42,938 --> 00:31:45,607
- 怎么回事? - 我忘了这事了
- What's going on? - I forgot.

376
00:31:45,733 --> 00:31:47,943
- 什么? - 是个集会
- What? - It's a rally.

377
00:31:48,110 --> 00:31:51,363
- 一个新的政党 - 真见鬼
- A new political party. - Bloody hell.

378
00:31:51,530 --> 00:31:55,367
我想还是把车留在这儿吧,先生 我们可以步行回去
I think I'd better leave your car here, sir. We can walk.

379
00:32:30,235 --> 00:32:33,697
- 那不是泰上校吗? - 是将军
- lsn't that Colonel The? - General The.

380
00:32:33,864 --> 00:32:35,783
- 谁升他为将军的? - 他自己
- Who made him a general? - He did.

381
00:32:35,949 --> 00:32:39,244
他脱离法国人,自己组建了军队
He broke away from the French and formed his own army.

382
00:33:14,905 --> 00:33:16,907
- 你好 - 嗨
- Hello. - Hi.

383
00:33:18,951 --> 00:33:20,953
你有狗
You have a dog.

384
00:33:22,955 --> 00:33:25,082
- 进来 - 谢谢
- Come in. - Thanks.

385
00:33:32,131 --> 00:33:35,259
- 凤在哪? - 她去看她姐了
- Where's Phuong? - She's gone to see her sister.

386
00:33:38,595 --> 00:33:41,849
- 想喝点威士忌吗? - 苏打水就行了,谢谢
- Would you like a whisky? - Just a soda, thanks.

387
00:33:45,519 --> 00:33:47,730
他非得跳上床吗?
Does he have to do that?

388
00:33:48,230 --> 00:33:50,607
公爵!到这儿来
Duke! Come here.

389
00:33:51,483 --> 00:33:53,277
- 你叫他公爵? -  是的
- You called him Duke. - Yeah.

390
00:33:53,444 --> 00:33:56,113
我在街上捡回来的
I found this guy in the street.

391
00:33:56,238 --> 00:34:00,117
谁会不理睬这么可爱的狗呢?
Didn't l? Who could turn their back on a mug like that?

392
00:34:00,951 --> 00:34:03,620
我在游行上看到你和乔.滕尼
I saw you and Joe Tunney at the parade.

393
00:34:04,455 --> 00:34:05,873
你也去了集会?
Did you go on to the rally?

394
00:34:06,040 --> 00:34:09,626
谢谢.是的,我去了 不过是为了别的事
Thanks. Yeah, I did. It was really something else.

395
00:34:09,793 --> 00:34:13,047
我以为只有美国政客才爱搞那种无聊事
I thought only American politicians went in for that nonsense.

396
00:34:13,213 --> 00:34:15,132
就差用来表示欢迎的彩带了
All that was missing was the ticker tape.

397
00:34:15,299 --> 00:34:17,968
他们没忘军乐队伴奏
They sure didn't forget the brass band.

398
00:34:19,011 --> 00:34:20,888
令人印象很深刻,那个泰将军
Impressive guy, that General The.

399
00:34:21,055 --> 00:34:23,724
你不介意他是个彻头彻尾的自大狂吗?
It doesn't trouble you that he's a complete egomaniac?

400
00:34:23,849 --> 00:34:28,062
听着,我不想在凤背后说她
Look, I don't want to talk about Phuong behind her back.

401
00:34:28,228 --> 00:34:31,065
我以为她会在这儿,但...
I thought she was going to be here, but...

402
00:34:31,231 --> 00:34:34,860
- 她姐姐跟我说了她的困境 - 什么困境?
- Her sister told me about her predicament. - And what predicament is that?

403
00:34:35,527 --> 00:34:37,404
我以为你知道
I think you know.

404
00:34:37,571 --> 00:34:39,490
你不能娶她
You can't marry her,

405
00:34:39,657 --> 00:34:43,702
和你在一起,她永远不可能与越南人有正常的婚姻
and by living with you she can never have a proper marriage to a Vietnamese man.

406
00:34:43,869 --> 00:34:46,914
她不需要同越南人有正常的婚姻
She doesn't need a proper marriage with a Vietnamese man.

407
00:34:47,081 --> 00:34:49,458
她和我在一起
She's with me.

408
00:34:49,625 --> 00:34:51,585
她来了
Here she is.

409
00:34:52,961 --> 00:34:54,463
你好,凤
Hello, Phuong.

410
00:34:54,630 --> 00:34:56,882
我姐出去了
My sister is out.

411
00:34:58,050 --> 00:35:00,636
- 你好 - 你好,很高兴见到你
- Hello. - Hello. It's nice to see you.

412
00:35:00,803 --> 00:35:04,974
派尔先生是特地来看你的,凤
It's you that Mr Pyle has come to visit, Phuong.

413
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:06,976
为什么我们不坐下呢?
So why don't we all sit down?

414
00:35:07,142 --> 00:35:09,395
除非你想我离开
Unless, of course, you want me to leave.

415
00:35:09,561 --> 00:35:11,480
不,那不妥
No. That wouldn't be right.

416
00:35:12,773 --> 00:35:14,817
那我们坐下吧
We should sit down, then.

417
00:35:25,285 --> 00:35:27,454
说吧
Fire away.

418
00:35:35,587 --> 00:35:41,093
自从我见到你,同你跳舞,和你聊天
Ever since I met you and danced with you and talked with you,

419
00:35:42,553 --> 00:35:46,598
我无时无刻不想着你
I haven't been able to get you out of my thoughts for more than a moment.

420
00:35:53,272 --> 00:35:55,441
我已经爱上你了
I've fallen in love with you.

421
00:36:01,572 --> 00:36:03,324
你爱上我?
You fall in love with me?

422
00:36:03,449 --> 00:36:07,202
请相信我 我以前从没这样过
Please believe me. I've never behaved like this before.

423
00:36:07,369 --> 00:36:12,416
我很抱歉,这很唐突,不太礼貌,但...
I apologise. It is abrupt and it is ill-mannered, but...

424
00:36:14,877 --> 00:36:16,879
我爱你
I'm in love with you.

425
00:36:19,631 --> 00:36:21,675
你不该是单膝下跪的吗?
Shouldn't you be on one knee?

426
00:36:26,013 --> 00:36:28,766
凤,我不是个富有的人
Look... Phuong, I'm not a rich man

427
00:36:28,932 --> 00:36:30,392
但我有我的资产
but I do have assets.

428
00:36:30,559 --> 00:36:32,811
-我们来丢硬币决定吧 - 你能给她什么?
- Let's toss for her. - What can you offer her?

429
00:36:32,978 --> 00:36:36,690
- 噢,主啊 - 我不奢望你立刻爱上我
- Oh, Christ. - I don't expect you to love me right away.

430
00:36:36,815 --> 00:36:39,193
你总是和司机上床
You could always make love to the chauffeur.

431
00:36:39,360 --> 00:36:41,862
你没有权利侮辱她!
You have no right to insult her!

432
00:36:42,029 --> 00:36:44,448
- 让你那该死的狗闭上嘴 - 跟我走吧
- Shut your bloody dog up. - Come away with me.

433
00:36:44,615 --> 00:36:47,576
叫他走,带上他的狗
Tell him to bugger off and take his dog with him.

434
00:36:51,038 --> 00:36:52,414
不
No.

435
00:36:56,585 --> 00:36:59,171
你说不?
Did you say no?

436
00:36:59,296 --> 00:37:02,508
坐下喝几杯吧
Yes. Sit down and have a scotch.

437
00:37:02,675 --> 00:37:05,010
不,我该走了,我很抱歉
No. I should go. I'm so sorry.

438
00:37:05,177 --> 00:37:07,763
- 你想抽烟斗吗? - 烟斗?
- Do you want to smoke a pipe? - A pipe?

439
00:37:07,930 --> 00:37:09,848
鸦片
Opium.

440
00:37:10,015 --> 00:37:12,518
不,我干嘛要抽那个?
No. Why would I do that?

441
00:37:31,745 --> 00:37:34,081
我知道我们结婚前你就警告过我
I know before we married you warned me

442
00:37:34,206 --> 00:37:37,918
你的信仰决定了你不可能和我离婚
beliefs meant that there could never be a divorce.

443
00:37:38,085 --> 00:37:42,214
但我还是想请求你
All the same, that's what I'm asking for now.

444
00:37:42,381 --> 00:37:45,759
事实上,我深深地爱着另一个人
The fact is, I love someone very much.

445
00:37:46,969 --> 00:37:50,389
我期望你好好想想再答复我
I want you to feel affection and act before you have time to think.

446
00:37:50,556 --> 00:37:54,560
发电报告诉我你同意吧
Just cable and tell me you agree.

447
00:38:01,859 --> 00:38:05,779
我刚写信请求我妻子和我离婚
I've just asked my wife for a divorce.

448
00:38:10,993 --> 00:38:12,995
你姐姐...
Your sister...

449
00:38:15,748 --> 00:38:17,374
她真的不在?
Was she really out?

450
00:38:18,208 --> 00:38:20,210
我说了她不在
I told you.

451
00:38:23,714 --> 00:38:26,675
我以为也许她叫你回来
I thought perhaps she sent you back

452
00:38:27,468 --> 00:38:29,511
这样你就可以遇见派尔
so that you could meet Pyle.

453
00:38:30,262 --> 00:38:32,264
他是那么年青
He's very young.

454
00:38:34,933 --> 00:38:36,935
那并不重要
That's not so important.

455
00:38:48,030 --> 00:38:51,992
好消息.他们登了你的报道
Good news. They printed your story.

456
00:38:52,910 --> 00:38:57,081
我收到史达明的电报 他们让我再留一个月
I got a cable from Stemins. This got me a month's reprieve.

457
00:38:58,624 --> 00:39:01,835
第十页 ''法军突破共军包围.''
Page ten. "French Break Communist Siege."

458
00:39:03,837 --> 00:39:06,340
他们没全用我的报道,不是吗?
They didn't use much, did they?

459
00:39:07,508 --> 00:39:10,052
根本没提到村民被杀
Nothing here about the villagers that were killed.

460
00:39:10,219 --> 00:39:11,971
法国报纸怎么说?
What did the French papers say?

461
00:39:12,137 --> 00:39:15,474
头条当然是谴责共军
Headlines blame it on the communists, of course.

462
00:39:15,641 --> 00:39:18,686
好吧,一个月就一个月
Well, a month is a month.

463
00:39:18,852 --> 00:39:23,315
你还能告诉我什么有关这个泰将军的?
What else can you tell me about this General The?

464
00:39:25,067 --> 00:39:28,779
他既反对法军,也反对共军
He's set himself up against both the French and the communists.

465
00:39:31,448 --> 00:39:34,743
你认为他会接受我的采访吗?
Do you think he'd give me an interview if I went up there?

466
00:39:34,910 --> 00:39:36,662
很难说
Difficult to say.

467
00:39:36,829 --> 00:39:40,249
也许他认为他能有机会散布他的主张
Perhaps if he thought he could get his message across.

468
00:39:40,374 --> 00:39:43,085
问题是怎么通过关卡
The problem would be getting it past the censor.

469
00:39:43,210 --> 00:39:46,213
不,真正的问题是怎样在天黑前...
No, the real problem would be to get close to the Cambodian border

470
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:47,840
通过柬埔寨边境
and back before dark.

471
00:39:48,007 --> 00:39:50,759
共军晚上控制了公路
The communists control that road at night.

472
00:39:50,926 --> 00:39:53,470
很多欧洲人在那儿被杀
So many Europeans have been killed out there.

473
00:40:04,773 --> 00:40:07,443
我是伦敦时报的托马斯.福勒
I am Thomas Fowler of the London Times

474
00:40:09,069 --> 00:40:12,531
我来这采访泰将军
and I'm here to interview General The.

475
00:40:15,034 --> 00:40:17,995
我是伦敦时报的托马斯.福勒
I'm Thomas Fowler of the London Times.

476
00:40:18,162 --> 00:40:21,957
我来这采访泰将军
I'm here to see General The.

477
00:40:31,216 --> 00:40:35,137
九月,十月,十一月...
September, October, November...

478
00:40:35,304 --> 00:40:38,807
派尔向凤未婚后我只见过他一次
I'd seen Pyle only once since he'd asked Phuong to marry him,

479
00:40:38,974 --> 00:40:40,934
在欧洲旅馆
at the Continental.

480
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:42,978
当然,他很客气 -
He'd been polite, of course -

481
00:40:43,145 --> 00:40:46,273
问我怎样,凤怎样?
how was I, how was Phuong?

482
00:40:46,440 --> 00:40:48,984
他说他很忙,不在城里
He'd been busy, he said, out of the city,

483
00:40:49,151 --> 00:40:52,029
在忙他的医疗计划
working on his medical programme.

484
00:40:52,196 --> 00:40:55,074
不过不知何故,我并不讶异见到他
Though somehow, I wasn't surprised to see him.

485
00:40:55,240 --> 00:40:59,161
我讶异的是我很高兴见到他
I was surprised to be pleased to see him.

486
00:40:59,328 --> 00:41:03,499
- 什么风把你吹到这儿来了? - 我想采访泰将军
- What brings you out to these parts? - I was hoping to interview the General.

487
00:41:03,666 --> 00:41:06,502
但他们不让我进去
But they've thrown me out of the place.

488
00:41:06,669 --> 00:41:10,547
- 你这次又有什么借口? - 这就像是对我们的测试
- What's your excuse this time? - This is like a test run for us.

489
00:41:10,714 --> 00:41:14,301
法国人,以他们典型的法国伤风 非常不合作
The French, in their typically French way, have been very uncooperative

490
00:41:14,468 --> 00:41:18,764
但泰将军却不错 让我们在这儿扎营
but General The has been good enough to let us set up camp here.

491
00:41:19,181 --> 00:41:21,183
我让他们放你进去
I'll get them to let you in.

492
00:41:22,017 --> 00:41:25,896
乔.滕尼同与泰亲近的商人进行援助计划
Joe Tunney's running aid programmes with business people close to The.

493
00:41:26,063 --> 00:41:28,065
- 莫依先生 - 派乐先生
- Mr Muoi. - Mr Pyle.

494
00:41:29,483 --> 00:41:31,485
- 你好,你怎样? - 很好
- Hello. How are you? - Good.

495
00:41:51,839 --> 00:41:55,759
我姓莫依 泰将军只有几分钟时间
My name is Mr Muoi. The General only has a few moments.

496
00:41:55,884 --> 00:41:58,304
我能先问你一个问题吗?
May I first ask you a question?

497
00:41:58,470 --> 00:42:02,016
-请 - 你和泰将军是什么关系?
- Please. - What is your relationship to the General?

498
00:42:02,141 --> 00:42:04,810
我是生意人,也是爱国者
I'm a businessman and a patriot.

499
00:42:06,854 --> 00:42:11,358
你看到的这些供给和援助 很多都是我努力的结果
Many of the supplies and aid you see are the result of my efforts.

500
00:42:11,525 --> 00:42:13,319
可以开始了吗?
Shall we begin?

501
00:42:13,485 --> 00:42:15,446
你说你已脱离了
You say you've broken away from

502
00:42:15,612 --> 00:42:19,658
你所服役的法军和越军
the French and Vietnamese forces with which you serve.

503
00:42:19,825 --> 00:42:21,827
你们之间还有关系吗?
Do any ties remain?

504
00:42:26,123 --> 00:42:28,167
法国人是殖民主义者
The French are colonialists.

505
00:42:30,085 --> 00:42:32,087
不值得信任
Not to be trusted.

506
00:42:37,217 --> 00:42:40,846
应该由独立的越南人来管理这国家
It will take an independent Vietnamese leader to rule our country.

507
00:42:41,013 --> 00:42:44,308
只有这么少的供给和士兵
How does the General expect to launch a successful campaign

508
00:42:44,433 --> 00:42:47,436
将军你凭什么...
against the larger forces of the communists and the French

509
00:42:47,561 --> 00:42:49,730
打赢法军和共军大部队?
with so few men and supplies?

510
00:42:51,106 --> 00:42:55,152
谁为将军提供致胜手段?
And who is providing the means for the General to achieve this?

511
00:43:05,204 --> 00:43:07,498
他是否在北部作战?
Has he been fighting his war in the north?

512
00:43:24,848 --> 00:43:27,935
在Phat Diem有场大屠杀
There was a massacre at Phat Diem.

513
00:43:28,102 --> 00:43:29,812
你的军队是不是在那儿?
Were your forces present?

514
00:43:43,867 --> 00:43:48,455
很遗憾,将军突然想起有个紧急约见
Regrettably the General has just recalled that he has an urgent appointment.

515
00:43:48,622 --> 00:43:50,708
- 所以,请了 - 谢谢
- So, please. - Thank you.

516
00:44:03,512 --> 00:44:04,930
这么快
That was quick.

517
00:44:05,097 --> 00:44:08,726
事情不像我计划的那样
Things didn't go entirely according to plan.

518
00:44:08,851 --> 00:44:11,603
小心乔
Watch yourself with Joe.

519
00:44:11,770 --> 00:44:14,690
我觉得他和泰将军在搞鬼
I think he's up to something with General The.

520
00:44:16,942 --> 00:44:20,070
我能坐你的车回西贡吗? 我的车有点问题
Can I get a ride to Saigon with you? Something's wrong with my car.

521
00:44:20,237 --> 00:44:22,156
可以,当然可以
Yes, of course you can.

522
00:44:22,323 --> 00:44:26,744
看,有好心人帮我擦车
Hello. Some kind soul has had mine cleaned.

523
00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:39,673
我听说你将被召会伦敦
I heard a rumour that you'd been recalled to London.

524
00:44:40,382 --> 00:44:43,844
真的?谁告诉你的?
Really? Who told you that?

525
00:44:44,011 --> 00:44:46,972
凤的姐姐
Phuong's sister.

526
00:44:51,769 --> 00:44:54,521
- 妈的 - 怎么了?
- Shit. - What is it?

527
00:44:54,688 --> 00:44:57,274
没油了
We're out of petrol.

528
00:44:57,441 --> 00:45:00,653
刚才肯定有谁把油吸走了
Some bugger up in the mountains must have siphoned it off.

529
00:45:13,499 --> 00:45:16,335
也许他们在了望塔有备用油
They might have some spare petrol in that watchtower.

530
00:45:34,186 --> 00:45:36,855
看上去是废弃的塔
It looks like it's deserted.

531
00:45:36,981 --> 00:45:39,066
我进去看看
I'll go in and have a look.

532
00:45:48,325 --> 00:45:50,285
有人吗?
Hello?

533
00:46:17,938 --> 00:46:21,191
- 没事吧? - 上来
- Is everything OK? - Come up.

534
00:46:22,985 --> 00:46:27,823
我和我朋友不得不在这呆到早上了

535
00:46:31,910 --> 00:46:33,329
这是不允许的

536
00:46:34,621 --> 00:46:36,040
是我朋友

537
00:46:58,812 --> 00:47:01,774
没事的,请放下枪

538
00:47:01,774 --> 00:47:05,736
请放下枪,他是我朋友

539
00:47:30,219 --> 00:47:32,012
在想什么?
What are you thinking?

540
00:47:35,391 --> 00:47:38,602
在想凤现在在做什么
I was wondering what she was doing right now.

541
00:47:48,112 --> 00:47:51,073
今天早上她和朋友一起早茶
This morning she met her friends for elevenses

542
00:47:51,240 --> 00:47:53,575

545
00:48:02,543 --> 00:48:04,670
买鱼做午餐
for fresh fish for dinner.

546
00:48:06,630 --> 00:48:11,885
现在她在翻杂志
And now she's flipping through the pages of magazines

547
00:48:13,512 --> 00:48:16,515
看皇室成员和电影明星的照片
Iooking at photographs of the royal family and film stars,

548
00:48:19,018 --> 00:48:22,271
听巴赫的曲子
Iistening to Bach's Well-Tempered Clavier.

549
00:48:24,940 --> 00:48:27,401
我和她就是从巴赫开始的

550
00:48:34,158 --> 00:48:36,410
你有过很多女人吗,托马斯?
Have you had a lot of women, Thomas?

551
00:48:39,455 --> 00:48:42,666
开始时很滥交
You start out by being promiscuous,

552
00:48:43,834 --> 00:48:46,503
但最后你会很专一 -
and end up like your grandfather -

553
00:48:46,628 --> 00:48:48,213
对一个女人忠诚不二
faithful to one woman.

554
00:48:50,341 --> 00:48:53,719
我知道凤不是没我就不行
I know I'm not essential to Phuong.

555
00:48:55,596 --> 00:48:58,307
但你相信我
But believe me when I tell you that

556
00:48:59,725 --> 00:49:01,644
如果我失去她
if I were to lose her,

557
00:49:03,854 --> 00:49:05,856
对我而言...
for me...

558
00:49:07,566 --> 00:49:10,235
就是死亡的开始
it would be the beginning of death.

559
00:49:19,370 --> 00:49:21,705
有人来了
Somebody's had it.

560
00:49:22,581 --> 00:49:26,335
从这到西贡有30或40个了望塔
There are 30 or 40 of these towers between here and Saigon.

561
00:49:26,502 --> 00:49:30,506
他们一晚只袭击一到两个 所以我们的机率不是很大
They only hit one or two a night so our odds aren't too bad.

562
00:49:33,133 --> 00:49:36,929
那你觉得共军来袭时他们会怎样?
So what do you think they'd do if the communists attacked?

563
00:49:37,096 --> 00:49:40,015
这两个人? 他们会开火然后逃跑
These two? They'd fire a shot and run.

564
00:49:40,933 --> 00:49:44,895
他们为什么要为我们而死? 或为法国人
Why should they die for us? Or the French.

565
00:49:45,813 --> 00:49:48,899
那是什么? 我看见有东西在动
What's that? I thought I saw something move.

566
00:49:55,698 --> 00:49:57,700
天啊,他们在这儿!
Christ, they're here!

567
00:50:02,913 --> 00:50:06,125
就我所听懂的 他们叫我们投降

568

别动! 给我枪!
Stop! Give me that!

569
00:50:15,509 --> 00:50:17,511
快来,托马斯
Come on, Thomas.

570
00:50:26,145 --> 00:50:28,480
- 怎么了? - 我想我扭到脚了
- What is it? - I think I've twisted my ankle.

571
00:51:11,857 --> 00:51:15,402
我沿路去下一个塔
I'm gonna head up the road to the next watchtower.

572
00:51:15,569 --> 00:51:19,239
看看能不能找到点汽油
See if I can find a French patrol.

573
00:51:19,948 --> 00:51:22,242
坐好,我会回来的
Sit tight, OK? I'll be back.

574
00:52:03,701 --> 00:52:06,537
能自我介绍吗?我叫托马斯. 福勒
May I introduce myself? Thomas Fowler.

575
00:52:26,890 --> 00:52:28,517
我找到汽油了
I found a patrol.

576
00:52:28,684 --> 00:52:30,978
如果我死了...
If I had died...

577
00:52:32,354 --> 00:52:34,898
你就能和她一起了
you could have had her.

578
00:52:44,533 --> 00:52:47,411
我想你得通知你的情报员
And I think you should inform your sources

579
00:52:47,578 --> 00:52:51,623
泰将军手下可不止他们所说的几百个人
that General The has a lot more men than the hundred of their count.

580
00:52:51,790 --> 00:52:54,585
我们得认真考虑他的报道
He's a story we should take seriously.

581
00:52:54,752 --> 00:52:57,129
别低估了爱国者,先生
Never underestimate a patriot, sir.

582
00:52:57,296 --> 00:53:01,675
你了解莫依吗? 他怎么能资助军队?
What do you know about Muoi? Could he finance The's army?

583
00:53:01,842 --> 00:53:04,094
他有家自行车厂!
He owns a bicycle factory!

584
00:53:04,261 --> 00:53:09,475
我想乔.滕尼和泰有阴谋
Well, I think Joe Tunney is plotting with he and The.

585
00:53:09,642 --> 00:53:12,311
他不止在搞外国援助这么简单

00:53:12,478 --> 00:53:15,189
我看看我能有什么消息,先生

592
00:54:08,659 --> 00:54:11,996
- 我帮你拿? - 不,亲亲我

既然你们俩都在这儿

我收到我妻子的信

我信任你,托马斯
I trusted you, Thomas.

620
00:56:47,943 --> 00:56:50,988
有女人在就有麻烦
Always a mistake when there's a woman involved.

621
00:56:51,155 --> 00:56:53,115
你不用谎言就不可能赢我?
Couldn't you have won without lying?

622
00:56:54,325 --> 00:56:55,909
怎么了,到底?
What is it, anyway?

623
00:56:56,076 --> 00:56:58,662
我姐姐看了你妻子的信
My sister read the letter from your wife.

624
00:56:58,829 --> 00:57:00,998
我给她看的
I show it to her

625
00:57:01,165 --> 00:57:05,753
因为...我太自豪了

00:57:05,919 --> 00:57:09,089
- 太高兴了 - 你怎么能这样欺骗她?

627
00:57:13,469 --> 00:57:16,138
''亲爱的托马斯- 你身边总是有女人
"Dear Thomas - you always picked up women

628
00:57:16,263 --> 00:57:18,432
就像你的鞋总粘到泥一样''
Iike you picked up mud on your shoes."

629
00:57:18,599 --> 00:57:21,143
我很抱歉,凤
I'm sorry, Phuong.

630
00:57:21,310 --> 00:57:24,772
- 那你为什么要骗她? - 很明显因为我想留住她
- So then why'd you lie to her? - Because I wanted to keep her.

631
00:57:24,938 --> 00:57:26,649
那不是爱
That's not love.

632
00:57:27,733 --> 00:57:29,485
看到吧,他甚至都不否认自己是个骗子

633
00:57:31,570 --> 00:57:36,283
''你难道没想过当你离开她回英国她会有多寂寞吗?''
"Have you ever stopped to think how lonely she'll be in England when you leave her?"

634
00:57:36,450 --> 00:57:38,452
闭嘴,看在老天的份上
Shut up, for Christ's sake.

635
00:57:40,579 --> 00:57:42,998
''我不主张离婚''

636
00:57:43,165 --> 00:57:48,087
''我的信仰也不允许 因此答案还是
"My religion forbids it. And so the answer is

637
00:57:48,253 --> 00:57:49,713
不.''
no."

638
00:57:52,174 --> 00:57:55,219
我被教育别看人家的信
I was taught never to read other people's letters.

639
00:57:55,386 --> 00:57:58,597
- 我被教育别说谎 - 走吧,凤
- I was taught not to tell lies. - Come on, Phuong.

640
00:58:01,600 --> 00:58:03,686
我不说越南话
I don't speak Vietnamese.

641
00:58:05,145 --> 00:58:06,855
滚吧
Get lost.

642
00:58:14,071 --> 00:58:17,199
你是对的,莫依的确有关系网
You were right about Muoi. He does have connections.

643
00:58:17,366 --> 00:58:19,660
呆会再谈这个好吗?
Can we discuss this some other time?

644

外国板条箱通过他的厂进来
Crates from overseas have been moving through his factory,

645
00:58:22,830 --> 00:58:24,957
绕过法国海关
bypassing French customs.

646
00:58:25,124 --> 00:58:28,252
我的情报员不知道箱里装的是什么
My sources have been unable to determine what they contain.

647
00:58:30,295 --> 00:58:32,840
他很可能贿赂了什么人
He's probably got someone on the take.

648
00:58:33,590 --> 00:58:35,551
他是出口商,不是进口商
He's an exporter, not an importer.

649
00:58:35,718 --> 00:58:38,804
好的,我们明天再查好吗?
Yes, well, we'll do that tomorrow, OK?

650
00:58:38,971 --> 00:58:41,515
不,今天下午就要出货了
No. A shipment just came in this afternoon.

回家去吧,回家

655
01:00:18,654 --> 01:00:21,407
他什么也不是

656
01:00:21,782 --> 01:00:24,660
- 你在干什么? - 在救你的命,快走!

- We can't have scenes in the office. - I know I am behaving badly.

663
01:01:27,056 --> 01:01:29,475
但我有充分理由粗鲁
But I have every intention of behaving badly.

664
01:01:29,642 --> 01:01:33,979
谁在这种情况下都会发火
This is exactly the kind of situation where one should behave badly.

665
01:01:34,146 --> 01:01:37,024

她本来想从我身上捞油水 现在她从派尔那捞
She tried to get a rake-off from me, but now she's getting one from Pyle.

01:01:44,990 --> 01:01:48,410
- 我们有很多事要做 -  如果派尔打电话来,跟他说我来过

670
01:01:48,577 --> 01:01:51,455
他应该回访
It would be polite to return the visit.

671
01:01:55,250 --> 01:01:56,794

692
01:04:24,566 --> 01:04:27,528
没,我想等我们有了房子才合适
No, I figured I'd wait until we got home and do it properly.

你不介意"不合适地"住在这儿?
You don't mind living here improperly?

694
01:04:30,948 --> 01:04:33,325
如果你总这么讽刺 那很难和你谈话

所以凤跟随你是件好事

要不然她会变成格兰吉的下一个女人

- The French have started to charge for... - You asked me for advice once.

You're probably on duty. I've noticed you're rarely off duty these days.

威士忌酒.人总会改变

789
01:16:27,748 --> 01:16:31,877
或者一个人并不是我们以为的那样

790
01:16:33,879 --> 01:16:36,382
你在说谁,托马斯?我还是你?
Who of us is, Thomas? Who of us is?

791
01:16:44,431 --> 01:16:46,517
我猜你想谈泰将军?

他原本和目标是军事游行

797
01:17:05,953 --> 01:17:08,038
我不该告诉你这个 我们对他很强硬
We were pretty tough on him.

798
01:17:08,163 --> 01:17:10,082
你告诉他你们不会支持他了?
Did you tell him you wouldn't support him?

799

- 我们告诉他如果他在行差踏错... - 他想杀了你,在你去西贡的路上
- We told him if he steps out of line again... - He tried to kill you on the road to Saigon.

801
01:17:19,550 --> 01:17:21,927
你早知道?

我怀疑他或他的手下要搞什么动作
I suspected that he might try something. Or one of his officers.

803
01:17:25,514 --> 01:17:27,683
所以我跟踪他们以防万一
So I tagged along just in case.

804
01:17:27,850 --> 01:17:30,519
如果你以为你能控制泰将军 那你真是傻瓜一个

在战争中,你得利用你能利用的工具

目前来讲,他是我们能利用的最好工具

如果我们要遏制共产主义 支持第三方

811
01:17:49,038 --> 01:17:52,458
我们必需得找个人民崇拜的领袖

812

明早国会听到报告,看过共产党暴行的照片

813
01:17:55,419 --> 01:17:58,922
他们会支持我们的计划的

814
01:17:59,089 --> 01:18:00,924
法国人不会遏制共产主义
The French won't stop the communists.

815
01:18:01,091 --> 01:18:04,762
他们没大脑,不懂得内情
They haven't got the brains and they haven't got the guts.

816
01:18:07,973 --> 01:18:10,392
我与这事有什么关系?
How did I fit into all this?

817
01:18:11,769 --> 01:18:13,729
我是你身份掩饰的一部分?
Am I part of your cover?

818
01:18:14,938 --> 01:18:17,483
还是情报来源?
Or a source of information?

819
01:18:18,859 --> 01:18:22,363
还是你一直都盯上凤?
Or did you have your eye on Phuong all the time?

820
01:18:22,529 --> 01:18:26,408
你和凤? 我从未预谋过什么 相信我
You and Phuong? I never planned for any of that to happen. Believe me.

821
01:18:26,575 --> 01:18:30,162
如果我没遇到你或她,事情会更好办些
It would have been easier if I'd never met either one of you.

822
01:18:30,329 --> 01:18:34,667
- 但你遇到了,所以你向我们说谎 - 你想我跟你说什么?
- But you did. And you lied to us. - What do you want me to tell you?

823
01:18:35,584 --> 01:18:38,962
说我没参与行动? 没参与计划?
That I took no action? That I have no opinion?

824
01:18:42,216 --> 01:18:44,927
告诉我你不是故意让这些发生
Tell me that you don't mean any of this.

825
01:18:45,886 --> 01:18:48,555
告诉我你只是听从命令
Tell me that you were only obeying orders.

826
01:18:48,681 --> 01:18:52,309
或告诉我在你看到广场爆炸中的...
Or tell me that after what you saw in the square, those children,

827
01:18:52,434 --> 01:18:54,311
无辜的,对人没有任何威胁的孩子后
who did nothing and hurt no one,

828
01:18:54,436 --> 01:18:56,814
对于这个行动的残暴和荒唐
tell me that you were so confused and horrified

829
01:18:56,981 --> 01:19:00,484
你是那么的困惑,惊恐
at how brutal and insane these actions are.

830
01:19:00,651 --> 01:19:04,321
告诉我你对凤的爱使你对这一切产生疑问
Tell me how your love for Phuong has caused you to have some doubts.

831
01:19:04,488 --> 01:19:08,325
但正因为凤,我更加坚定
But it's because of Phuong that I am even more determined.

832
01:19:08,492 --> 01:19:13,288
就说凤吧 她是美人,是教授的女儿
Let's just look at Phuong. There's beauty. There's daughter of a professor.

833
01:19:13,455 --> 01:19:16,125
是舞女,是欧洲老男人的情妇
Taxi dancer. Mistress of an older European man.

834
01:19:16,291 --> 01:19:18,836
那些都充分反映这整个国家
That pretty well describes the whole country.

835
01:19:19,003 --> 01:19:23,048
听着,托马斯,我们到这就是要把越南 从那一切中解脱出来
Look, Thomas, we are here to save Vietnam from all of that.

836
01:19:23,215 --> 01:19:25,551
广场上发生的事令我觉得不舒服
What happened in the square makes me sick.

837
01:19:25,718 --> 01:19:28,095
但长远来看,我在拯救生命
But in the long run, I'm going to save lives.

838
01:19:31,849 --> 01:19:33,892
那人是你,是不是?
It's you, isn't it?

839
01:19:34,518 --> 01:19:37,438
乔.滕尼,公使馆的人
Joe Tunney, the staff at the legation,

841
01:19:41,275 --> 01:19:44,570
他们都他妈的听人的命令,派尔
They all take their fucking orders from you, Pyle.

842
01:19:45,446 --> 01:19:49,241
约克.哈丁在你随身带的那书里胡说八道 什么第三方力量
York Harding prattles on about a third force in that book you carry around.

843
01:19:51,368 --> 01:19:53,370
而你却真得策划了一个
You've actually gone out and made one.

844
01:19:54,830 --> 01:19:57,708
我不认为你领会到了全局观念,托马斯
I don't think you see the big picture, Thomas.

845
01:19:58,709 --> 01:20:01,712
不,我领会到了
No, I do not see the big picture.

846
01:20:12,389 --> 01:20:14,183
你知道这首诗吗?
Do you know this poem?

847
01:20:14,350 --> 01:20:17,978
''我走在街上,什么也不在乎

人们看着我,问我我是谁

我叫她吃完饭来见我

我们要问你几个问题

871
01:24:03,871 --> 01:24:05,664
我不介意他残废
I don't care if he's crippled.

872
01:24:05,831 --> 01:24:08,042
只要他别死
I just don't want him to die.

873
01:24:50,042 --> 01:24:52,544
我很抱歉,我得去透透气
I'm sorry. I've just got to get some air.

01:25:39,049 --> 01:25:44,179
至少2000人死亡,还有更多受伤
At least 2,000 people were killed and scores of others injured.

875
01:25:44,305 --> 01:25:46,557
上星期在西贡的爆炸事件中
In the wake of last week's bomb blast in Saigon,

876
01:25:46,974 --> 01:25:49,476
法国官方报道...
French officials report...

877
01:25:57,359 --> 01:25:59,361
很抱歉打扰你,但...
I'm sorry to bother you, but...

878
01:25:59,528 --> 01:26:01,864
你介意和我一起下楼吗?
would you mind to come downstairs with me?

879
01:26:02,906 --> 01:26:06,618
- 你想怎样? - 我要给你看点东西
- What do you want? - I have something to show you.

880
01:26:08,537 --> 01:26:12,708
似乎派尔先生死那晚来见过你
It seems Monsieur Pyle came to see you the night he died.

881
01:26:13,625 --> 01:26:16,170
- 那又怎样? - 你说他没来过
- So what, Vigot? - You said he did not.

882
01:26:19,340 --> 01:26:23,052
还有,我们找到派尔的狗
By the way, we found Pyle's dog.

883
01:26:23,218 --> 01:26:25,512
他们割段了他的喉咙
They cut its throat.

884
01:26:28,807 --> 01:26:30,851
你看到吗?
You see here?

885
01:26:31,018 --> 01:26:34,313
派尔的狗脚趾间有水泥
Pyle's dog had cement between its toes.

886
01:26:34,480 --> 01:26:37,858
这的水泥是他被杀那天下午浇得
This was poured on the afternoon of his murder.

887
01:26:38,025 --> 01:26:40,027
那能说明什么?
So what does that prove?

888
01:26:42,571 --> 01:26:45,658
还有Vieux Moulin 饭店的老板告诉我
And the patron of the Vieux Moulin told me

889
01:26:45,783 --> 01:26:50,329
那晚你只要了一个位子
that night you asked for a table for one.

890
01:26:50,954 --> 01:26:52,414
而不是两个
Not two.

891
01:26:53,791 --> 01:26:56,919
我对于我最初的口供没任何可再说的
I have nothing more to add to my original statement.

892
01:27:00,172 --> 01:27:01,715
没有?
Nothing?

893
01:27:07,012 --> 01:27:09,014
你知道不是我杀他的
You know I didn't kill him, Vigot.

894
01:27:14,687 --> 01:27:17,022
现在是战争年代
There's a war on.

895
01:27:17,147 --> 01:27:19,066
每天都有人死
People are dying every day.

896
01:28:40,814 --> 01:28:43,275
找别的女孩
Ask another girl.

897
01:28:44,610 --> 01:28:46,528
我不想找别的女孩
I don't want another girl.

898
01:29:17,601 --> 01:29:20,896
你能回到我身边吗,凤?
Will you come back now, Phuong?

899
01:29:21,063 --> 01:29:23,732
- 你能回到我身边吗? - 回伦敦?
- Will you come back to me? - To London?

900
01:29:24,942 --> 01:29:27,528
不,不回伦敦
No. Not to London.

901
01:29:29,822 --> 01:29:32,157
那我不会回来的
Then I don't come back.

902
01:29:32,324 --> 01:29:34,785
拜托,我...
Please. I...

903
01:29:36,036 --> 01:29:38,038
我不能带你去伦敦
I can't take you to London.

904
01:29:38,914 --> 01:29:41,333
因为我不去那儿
Because I'm not going.

905
01:29:43,002 --> 01:29:45,004
我不会离开你
I'm not leaving you.

906
01:29:52,094 --> 01:29:53,304
永远不
Never.

907
01:29:56,181 --> 01:29:58,726
你能回来我身边吗?
Will you come back to me?

908
01:30:33,719 --> 01:30:37,056
- 能帮我拆头发吗? - 好的
- Will you take down my hair? - Yes.

909
01:30:56,075 --> 01:30:58,160
你想他吗?
Do you miss him?

910
01:31:05,376 --> 01:31:07,586
是的
Yes.

911
01:31:08,962 --> 01:31:10,589
我很抱歉
I'm sorry.

912
01:31:13,092 --> 01:31:15,594
为什么抱歉?
Why are you sorry?

913
01:31:16,303 --> 01:31:18,347
我不知道
I don't know.

914
01:31:19,473 --> 01:31:21,850
我只是觉得...
I just feel that...

915
01:31:22,017 --> 01:31:25,145
我应该向....谁道歉
I ought to apologise to... someone.

916
01:31:29,191 --> 01:31:31,193
不是我
Not to me.

917
01:31:32,069 --> 01:31:33,696
永远不会是我
Never to me.

918
01:31:42,538 --> 01:31:44,832
人们说你来到越南
They say you come to Vietnam

919
01:31:44,999 --> 01:31:48,711
你会立即明白很多事
and understand a lot in a few minutes.

920
01:31:48,877 --> 01:31:53,340
剩下的得自己去体验
The rest has got to be lived.

921
01:31:53,507 --> 01:31:56,051
他们说不管你寻求什么
They say whatever it was you were looking for

922
01:31:56,885 --> 01:31:58,887
你都能在这如愿以偿
you will find here.

923
01:31:59,888 --> 01:32:03,976
人们说每间房里都有鬼魂
They say there is a ghost in every house.

924
01:32:04,852 --> 01:32:07,354
如果你能和他和平共处
And if you can make peace with him,

925
01:32:07,521 --> 01:32:09,481
他会很安静
he will stay quiet.
