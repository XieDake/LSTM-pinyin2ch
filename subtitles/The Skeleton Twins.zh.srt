他大玩音乐是件好事

你又找回幽默感了
I see you're getting your sense of humor back.

是啊 没人能带走它
Yeah, they can't take that away from me.

82
00:07:48,320 --> 00:07:50,049

I was thinking,

或许你会想搬来和我一起住?
Maybe you'd wanna come stay with me?

84

- 是我自己的决定  - 好吧 无所谓啦
- This was my decision.  - Yeah, whatever.

90
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:14,923
他们让你有负疚感不得不这么做
They guilted you into this.

91
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:18,891
你说得对 这主意也许不好
You're right. It's probably a bad idea.

我和我的兄弟克雷格 几年前 我们去了哥斯达黎加
Me and my buddy Craig, a couple years ago, we went to Costa Rica.

136
00:11:04,680 --> 00:11:08,048
在没遇到玛姬之前 玛姬未出现之前
This was before Maggie was on the scene. PM, Pre-Maggie.

137
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:11,363
我们第一次去潜水的时候
And the first time we go out on a dive,

138
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:15,609
我们看到了一只该死的海龟 非常罕见
we saw an effing sea turtle, which is very rare.

139
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,206
- 非常非常罕见  - 我认为挺正常的 不是吗?
- Incredibly rare.  - I think it's pretty normal, right?

140
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:19,440
- 看到海龟?  - 什么?
- Seeing sea turtles?  - What?

141
00:11:19,480 --> 00:11:21,687
你潜水的时候 看到海龟? 我觉得这非常...
When you're diving, seeing sea turtles? I think that's very...

142
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:23,649
不 我觉得你想到的是那种普通的乌龟
No, I think you're thinking of just regular turtles

143
00:11:23,720 --> 00:11:25,370
那种在池塘和小溪里经常见到
that you'd see in, like, a pond or a stream.

144
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,284
我刚刚说的那种是大自然里的海龟
I'm talking about a sea turtle in the wild.

145
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:32,524
我们当时离它很近 甚至可以触摸到它
We were swimming so close to it that you could practically touch it.

146
00:11:33,280 --> 00:11:35,362
- 我可以告诉他吗? 可以吗?  - 没什么值得说的
- Is it okay if I tell him? Can I?  - Nothing really to tell yet.

147
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,726
准备好听点大新闻了吗?
You ready for some big news?

148
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:42,162
- 我们在尝试怀上孩子  - 真的吗?

00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:20,566
有人在家吗?
Hello?

290
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:22,604
- 嗨.  - 手里拿的是什么?
- Hi.  - What the hell's that?

291
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:24,849
是给你第一天上班的礼物
Happy first day of work.

292
00:21:24,920 --> 00:21:26,251
你没必要送我礼物的
You didn't have to do that.

293
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:28,405
怎么了? 不喜欢吗?
What, you don't like it?

294
00:21:28,520 --> 00:21:29,806
怎么会 我喜欢 这礼物很赞
No, I love it. It's great.

295
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:31,769
我告诉某人我在城里
So, I told somebody that I was in town,

296
00:21:32,040 --> 00:21:36,011
本来我没想到她会来的 你别吓到了
and I didn't think she would come, so don't freak out.

297
00:21:37,120 --> 00:21:39,122
嗨 宝贝
Hi, Angel.

298
00:21:39,640 --> 00:21:40,721
妈妈
Mother.

299
00:21:40,920 --> 00:21:42,888
哎呀
Oh, dear.

300
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:46,929
好吧 玻璃碎了 大伙都别动 我去拿簸箕 你没事吧?
Okay, broken glass. Everybody freeze. I'm gonna go get a dustpan. You okay?

301
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:48,884
- 没事  - 那我去拿簸箕了  
- Yeah.  - I'm gonna go get a dustpan.

302
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:49,961
好的
Okay.

303
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:54,528
- 那是坦纳吗?  - 不 那个是塔德
- So, that's Tanner?  - No, that's Tad.

304
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:56,370
坦纳是年纪最大的那个
Tanner's the oldest.

305
00:21:57,080 --> 00:21:58,730
他们长得真像他们父亲
They look a lot like their father.

306
00:21:59,560 --> 00:22:01,403
- 看见没?  - 我特别喜欢拱桥
- See?  - I love Arches.

307
00:22:01,760 --> 00:22:03,649
- 看见了  - 大峡谷现在变得太过商业化
- Yeah.  - The Grand Canyon's gotten so commercial.

308
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:07,042
而拱桥却保留了它的精华 知道吗?
Arches has retained its essence, you know?

309
00:22:07,120 --> 00:22:09,566
那是个精神圣地
It's just such a very, very spiritual place.

310
00:22:09,680 --> 00:22:11,011
拱桥那里是最好的
Arches is rad.

311
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:14,801
大二春天的假期里我自驾游过那个地方
I actually road-tripped it down there spring break sophomore year.

312
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:18,763
- 太疯狂了 太不可思议了  - 干杯 干杯 我想和你们干一杯
- It's insane. Unbelievable.  - A toast? A toast? I want to make a toast.

313
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:25,326
致我一双漂亮的儿女 以及我可爱的女婿
To my beautiful, beautiful children, and to my lovely son-in-law.

314
00:22:26,040 --> 00:22:30,329
愿阳光无尽的能量洒在你们身上
May the light embrace you with its energy infinite.

315
00:22:31,320 --> 00:22:35,291
愿你们住在一个满是宁静祥和的地方
May you dwell in a place of peace and tolerance.

316
00:22:36,680 --> 00:22:41,402
愿你们的岁月中永远充盈着温暖与理解
May you live in warmth and understanding for your days eternal.

317
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:43,210
- 阿门  - 是
- Amen.  - Yeah.

318
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,011
- 干杯  - 现在
- Cheers.  - Now.

319
00:22:45,080 --> 00:22:46,605
亲爱的 谢谢
Darling, thank you.

320
00:22:47,760 --> 00:22:49,967
你们什么时候去赛多纳看看我们?
So, when are you gonna come down and visit us in Sedona?

321
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:52,004
等我们被邀请了再去
I guess whenever we're invited.

322
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:54,243
天啊 你们直接去就好了
Oh, my God! You just have to show up.

323
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:56,561
就直接上门好了 我们不喜欢规划
Just drop in. We don't like to be scheduled.

324
00:22:56,640 --> 00:22:58,369
- 好极了  - 很好 下周如何?   
- Perfect.  - Great, so how's next week?

325
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:01,644
下周... 下周不是蛮方便
Next... That's not gonna actually be the best week.

326
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:04,530
那好 下下周我们去看你吧
Okay, great. The week after that. We can go then.

327
00:23:06,480 --> 00:23:07,766
好吧...
Okay, well...

328
00:23:07,840 --> 00:23:09,808
妈吗 那些羊驼怎样了?
Hey, Mom, how are the alpacas?

329
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:13,728
鉴于它们到处拉屎 我们不得不处理掉它们 
We had to get rid of them. It was just too much poop.

330
00:23:13,800 --> 00:23:16,087
你知道人们怎么说吗 每个人都会排泄 不是吗?
You know what they say, everybody poops, right?

331
00:23:16,240 --> 00:23:18,925
我还小的时候 就以为女孩子不会便便
When I was a kid, I didn't think that girls pooped.

332
00:23:19,040 --> 00:23:21,611
- 真的  - 我从来没有大便过
- Seriously.  - I've never taken a shit before.

333
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:24,281
麦洛
Milo.

334
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,806
对了 妈妈 你的静思会怎么样了?
So what about your insight retreats, Mom?

335
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:30,801
- 怎么了  - 最近会不会有? 
- What about them?  - Do you have one coming up?

336
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:31,881
何出此言?
Why do you ask?

337
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:33,885
我只是想确定自己一生中最重要的日子
Oh, I just want to make sure I don't schedule

338
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:36,645
不会被放在同一天
the most important event of my life on the same day.

339
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:37,846
好吧 只是...
Okay, just...

340
00:23:37,920 --> 00:23:40,082
你知道吗? 错过了你的婚礼我真的很难过
You know it broke my heart to miss the wedding.

341
00:23:40,160 --> 00:23:42,367
事实上 我真感觉不到你在意
Actually, you know, I don't know that it did.

342
00:23:43,000 --> 00:23:46,527
- 可是现在你在我们身边了 不是吗?  - 是的 谢谢 
- You're here now, right?  - Yes, yes. Thank you.

343
00:23:46,600 --> 00:23:48,720
你们都听到了我从没大便过吧?
Did everybody hear how I've never taken a shit before?

344
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:49,841
- 你们怀念那些岁月吗?  - 怀念
- Did you guys miss that?  - Yeah.

345
00:23:49,920 --> 00:23:52,002
我们干嘛还要讨论那些不愉快的事情呢?
Why are we talking about such unpleasant things?

346
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:55,651
麦洛 亲爱的 你最近有何新进展?
Milo, what's new with you, darling?

347
00:23:58,680 --> 00:24:00,967
我去拿点塔巴斯科辣酱
I'm gonna go grab the Tabasco.

348
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:03,364
你们有什么想要的吗?
Anybody like anything?

349
00:24:04,680 --> 00:24:06,444
一切都好
Everything's great.

350
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:09,969
- 很好  - 好极了  
- It's good.  - That's terrific.

351
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:13,609
一切都很好
Everything is terrific.

352
00:24:15,880 --> 00:24:17,041
现在 呼气
Now, breathe out.

353
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,571
对
Yes.

354
00:24:21,360 --> 00:24:23,362
你身心都得到净化了 睁开眼睛
You're cleansed. Open your eyes.

355
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:25,963
天啊! 你感觉如何?
Oh, my God! How do you feel?

356
00:24:26,040 --> 00:24:29,328
很好 只是可能有点醉意
Good, yeah. I might be a little drunk.

357
00:24:29,720 --> 00:24:31,085
你看起来完全不同了
You look completely different.

358
00:24:31,160 --> 00:24:33,208
天啊! 感觉就是... 就是...
Oh, my God! There's just... There's a...

359
00:24:33,280 --> 00:24:36,648
一种纯净的气息和光芒
A purity and a kind of a glow coming off you.

360
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:39,564
正从你的天灵盖散发出来
It's emanating from your crown chakra.

361
00:24:40,920 --> 00:24:42,649
兰斯 你要不要来试试?
Lance, would you like to be cleansed?

362
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,200
我不需要了 谢谢 我早上才做过桑拿
I'm okay, thank you. I took a sauna this morning.

363
00:24:45,280 --> 00:24:47,760
- 我现在觉得很好了  - 亲爱的 你呢?  
- But I feel good.  - Sweetheart?

364
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,450
我一般不在喝酒的时候净化心灵
Oh, I don't usually drink and cleanse.

365
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:51,363
就像个人原则一样
Just, like, personal policy.

366
00:24:51,800 --> 00:24:52,926
不过还是谢谢你
But thank you.

367
00:24:53,000 --> 00:24:55,924
好吧 我想我也是时候回去了
Okay, I guess I should be heading back.

368
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,765
什么 这时候回亚利桑那?
What, like, back to Arizona?

369
00:24:57,920 --> 00:24:59,763
及其巧合的是
Well, it's a terrific coincidence.

370
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:04,006
玛姬 你问过我关于静思会的事
You know, Maggie, you asked me about the insight retreat.

371
00:25:04,280 --> 00:25:05,770
猜猜今年在哪里举行?
Guess where it is this year?

372
00:25:06,440 --> 00:25:08,602
伍德斯托克 离这可近了
Woodstock. Around the corner.

373
00:25:08,760 --> 00:25:10,920
- 你开玩笑吧  - 我是说 这也太...
- Oh, you've gotta be kidding.  - I mean, it's such a...

374
00:25:11,080 --> 00:25:13,048
这真是太好了
This just worked out perfectly.

375
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,486
那是你来这里的原因吗?
So that's why you came here?

376
00:25:14,560 --> 00:25:16,085
不 不
No, no.

377
00:25:16,200 --> 00:25:17,770
我来这里是为了看看你们两
I came here to see you two.

378
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:19,365
闭嘴吧 妈吗
Oh, just shut up, Mother.

379
00:25:19,720 --> 00:25:21,688
- 嘿  玛姬  - 这真是老把戏了
- Hey, Maggie.  - This is classic.

380
00:25:22,680 --> 00:25:25,331
- 经典的一派胡言  - 好了 玛姬...     
- Classic bullshit.  - Okay, Maggie...

381
00:25:25,560 --> 00:25:27,369
但是我还是要表扬你 真的
I have to compliment you, though. I really do.

382
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:28,726
你表现的真不错
You gave it a good shot.

383
00:25:28,960 --> 00:25:32,282
但是 我也不得不告诉你 你真不是一个当演员的料子
But I have to tell you, you're really not that good of an actress.

384
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:36,809
- 好吧 鉴于现在的气氛还是很好的...  - 不要再尝试了 朱蒂
- Okay. Well, as pleasant as this is...  - Stop trying, Judy.

385
00:25:38,360 --> 00:25:40,044
不要再尝试了 
Stop trying.

386
00:25:40,720 --> 00:25:43,929
比起做一个不称职的母亲 这世上还有更多糟糕的事呢
There are worse things than being a shitty mother.

387
00:25:46,640 --> 00:25:50,087
如果你话说完了
So, if you've finished

388
00:25:51,640 --> 00:25:53,085
把不满都吐槽完了
vomiting all over me,

389
00:25:54,120 --> 00:25:55,485
我只想说
I will just say

390
00:25:56,800 --> 00:26:01,089
谢谢你招待我 还有麦洛 谢谢你的邀请
thank you for dinner, and, Milo, thank you for the invitation.

391
00:26:02,560 --> 00:26:05,803
我很遗憾最后结果是这样
I'm sorry the night ended up being so toxic.

392
00:26:07,800 --> 00:26:09,245
我只想你们两知道
I just want you both to know.

393
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:10,885
天啊
Oh, my God!

394
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:14,244
我向你们传递了光芒
I'm sending you the light.

395
00:26:15,600 --> 00:26:16,931
晚安 兰斯
Good night, Lance.

396
00:26:17,160 --> 00:26:19,731
晚安 朱蒂 我送送你
Good night, Judy. I'll walk you out.

397
00:26:25,040 --> 00:26:27,850
好吧 至少她向我们传递了光芒
Well, at least she's sending us the light.

398
00:27:20,240 --> 00:27:24,040
- 这是鞋子吗?  -对的 算是吧 他们是混合产物  
- Are those shoes?  - Yeah, kinda. They're a hybrid.

399
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:25,721
什么的混合产物...
Hybrid of...

400
00:27:25,880 --> 00:27:29,726
就是鞋子和脚丫子
Of, you know, just shoes and a foot.

401
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:31,525
人脚
The human foot.

402
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:36,251
大多数人吃东西都用刀叉的
You know, some people use a knife and fork for those things.

403
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:40,251
是吗? 好吧 我不同于大多数人 宝贝 我想这就是为什么你会爱上我
Yeah? Well, I'm not most people, babe, and I think that's why you love me.

404
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,245
就因为我特立独行
Cause I set myself aside from the pack.

405
00:27:43,640 --> 00:27:45,802
- 是的  - 今晚见 好吧?
- Yeah.  - I'll see you tonight, okay?

406
00:27:45,960 --> 00:27:47,246
我得走了
I gotta get going.

407
00:27:47,400 --> 00:27:49,209
- 你来了  - 嘿
- Oh, there he is.  - Hey.

408
00:27:49,560 --> 00:27:51,164
怎么了 长官?
What's up, chief?

409
00:27:52,440 --> 00:27:54,010
没事
Nothing.

410
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:56,202
那就好 回来见
Okay, I'll check you two dudes later.

411
00:27:56,360 --> 00:27:59,364
钱包 兰斯 在哪里? 宝贝 在哪里?
Wallet, Lance. Where is it, baby? Where is it?

412
00:28:03,040 --> 00:28:04,530
他有不是这样的时候吗?
Is he ever not like that?

413
00:28:05,280 --> 00:28:07,000
你知道我很高兴你在这里吧?
You know I'm happy that you're here, right?

414
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:09,600
- 又来了  - 还有你想呆多久都可以
- Here it comes.  - And you can stay as long as you need.

415
00:28:09,680 --> 00:28:11,728
- 但是...  - 你在想什么?
- But...  - What do you think?

416
00:28:13,000 --> 00:28:15,571
- 我觉得她会变得不一样的  - 这不重要
- I thought she'd be different.  - It doesn't matter.

417
00:28:15,640 --> 00:28:18,160
关键是你没有权力在未经我同意的情况下带她回来
You had no right bringing her into this house without asking me.

418
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:19,611
遵命 长官
Yes, Warden.

419
00:28:21,880 --> 00:28:24,804
你真的觉得她会不一样吗? 真的觉得她会关心咱们?
Did you really think she'd be different, that she'd actually give a shit about us?

420
00:28:25,120 --> 00:28:26,804
- 或许吧  - 算了吧
- Maybe.  - Please.

421
00:28:27,280 --> 00:28:29,931
自从爸爸... 她就和我们没关系了
She's been done with us ever since Dad...

422
00:28:31,040 --> 00:28:32,326
我一点也不怪咱爸
I don't even blame him.

423
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:36,165
如果和她那样的人结婚 我也宁愿跳河自杀 
Imagine being married to her. I'd probably jump off a bridge, too.

424
00:28:36,280 --> 00:28:37,805
好吧
Okay.

425
00:28:39,360 --> 00:28:41,408
我不想吃了 你来解决掉吧
I don't want this. Eat it.

426
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:44,690
好
Okay.

427
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:47,564
- 你现在感觉如何  - 很不错
- So, how you feel?  - I'm good.

428
00:28:47,640 --> 00:28:49,290
- 真的吗?  - 真的
- Yeah?  - Yeah.

429
00:28:50,240 --> 00:28:52,000
我就是对那天发生的事情有点尴尬
I'm a little embarrassed about the other day.

430
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:54,768
那时候我分心了 神游万里了
I was on planet Jupiter or something.

431
00:28:55,640 --> 00:28:57,130
这没什么好担心的
Don't worry about it.

432
00:28:57,480 --> 00:28:59,005
- 我就是个傻瓜  - 才不是呢  
- I'm a doof.  - No.

433
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:01,242
你是我最喜欢的学员之一
You're one of my favorites.

434
00:29:12,840 --> 00:29:14,888
曾经有人让我读读这本书
Someone told me to read this once.

435
00:29:20,680 --> 00:29:21,681
去哪呢 头儿?
Where to, boss?

436
00:29:22,040 --> 00:29:24,122
- 我需要你告诉我你出现在这里的原因  - 我... 
- I need you to tell me why you're here.  - I'm...

437
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:27,969
我只是想和你说说话 只是想知道你是否一切安好
I just want to make conversation. I just want to see how you're doing.

438
00:29:28,280 --> 00:29:30,851
- 真的吗?  - 真的 没别的了
- Really?  - Yeah, nothing more.

439
00:29:31,320 --> 00:29:33,800
我绝对不会把你的蛋蛋割掉的
I'm not gonna chop your balls off just yet.

440
00:29:36,200 --> 00:29:39,204
好吧 因为我近期真的不想再见到你了
Okay, cause I really wasn't expecting to see you anytime soon.

441
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:41,282
- 我知道  - 这样很奇怪
- I'm sure.  - This is weird.

442
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,488
我知道 我知道确实很奇怪
I know. I know it's weird.

443
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:54,650
你现在... 你究竟... 你现在好吗?

Melinda. She's great. She's an optometrist.

Really good for me. She gets along with Eric really well.

448
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:11,683
- 埃里克?  - 我儿子
- Eric?  - My son.

449
00:30:12,360 --> 00:30:14,328
对 你的儿子
Right, your son.

450
00:30:18,280 --> 00:30:19,725

Are you living here now?

451
00:30:19,920 --> 00:30:21,729

Temporarily. I'm just here for... I live in L.A.

453

- 在那的生活如何?   - 蛮好的 一切都很顺利  
- How's that?  - Good, good. It's going really well.

455
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:30,686
关键是在那里我一直很忙 知道吗?
I mean, the key is just staying busy, you know?

456
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:37,086
我一直在表演啊 试镜啊 我现在还有了自己的经纪人
I've just been acting and auditioning and I just got this agent.

457
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:38,851
- 真的吗?  - 对 我有自己的经纪人了
- Really?  - Yeah, I have an agent now.

458
00:30:38,920 --> 00:30:42,367
- 经纪人 哇 太棒了  - 是啊
- An agent. Wow, that's impressive.  - Yeah.

459
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:49,360
你到城里来 除了跑到书店见我以外还有什么原因呢?
What brings you to town other than scaring the shit out of me at a bookstore?

460
00:30:49,640 --> 00:30:51,608
我只是想来见你而已
Yeah, that was my sole purpose.

461
00:30:51,680 --> 00:30:55,241
不 我... 有一个作家休养地
No, I... There's a writer's retreat.

462
00:30:55,880 --> 00:30:57,689
而我正在写一部独角戏
You know, I'm writing this one-man show.

463
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,085
对于这我一点也不感到惊讶 你写作一直很好
Well, it doesn't surprise me at all. You were always a great writer.

464
00:31:02,240 --> 00:31:04,891
那是因为我有一个...  
Oh, well, I had a...

465
00:31:05,600 --> 00:31:07,125
很好的导师
I had a good teacher.

466
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:14,207
在夏威夷岛屿的科纳海滨的帕瓦伊海湾 有一个小海湾
It's a little cove off the Pawai Bay on the Kona Coast, off the Big Island.

467
00:31:14,800 --> 00:31:16,882
我的朋友麦克自从05年起就一直呆在那儿了
My mate Mike has been there since 05

468
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,008
参加一些小组织潜水 我和你说哦...
taking small groups diving, and I'm telling you...

469
00:31:19,680 --> 00:31:21,330
- 美吗?  - 美极了
- Pretty?  - It's stunning.

470
00:31:21,440 --> 00:31:24,091
你可以看见海龟 蝠鲼 大青鲨
Sea turtles, manta rays, blue sharks.

471
00:31:24,160 --> 00:31:26,162
听起来很不可思议
That sounds incredible.

472
00:31:26,520 --> 00:31:28,124
除了鲨鱼 我觉得
Except for the sharks, I guess.

473
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:30,130
它们是无害的
They're harmless.

474
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:32,325
而且
Besides,

475
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:36,331
由你来应付区区一只小小老鲨鱼是没有问题的
you could handle a little old shark.

476
00:31:48,520 --> 00:31:50,090
- 你要再来一杯吗?  - 好 
- You want another?  - Yeah.

477
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:51,611
还是不要了
No. No.

478
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:55,007
我觉得我已经喝多了
I think I've filled my quota.

479
00:31:56,000 --> 00:31:57,240
我该走了
I should go.

480
00:31:57,320 --> 00:32:00,563
- 可是我还没喝完呢  - 来 我来
- I haven't finished my drink yet.  - Here, I'll take that.

481
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:05,888
好了 我们撤吧
Okay, there we go.

482
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,247
玩得很开心
That was fun.

483
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:10,529
我们一起喝了酒 感觉很不错 谢谢你
We had drinks. That was nice. Thank you.

484
00:32:11,400 --> 00:32:13,402
潜水课上见
I will see you in class.

485
00:32:17,320 --> 00:32:18,526
天啊
Shit.

486
00:32:45,960 --> 00:32:47,200
亲爱的?
Sweetie?

487
00:32:48,760 --> 00:32:49,921
嗯?
Yeah?

488
00:32:50,000 --> 00:32:52,128
我们的特色披萨吃完了吗? 
Are we out of pizza pockets?

489
00:32:54,960 --> 00:32:55,850
应该是吧
I think so.

490
00:32:55,863 --> 00:32:58,567
那你能把它们写在购物清单里吗?
Well, can you put them on the list, please?

491
00:33:03,440 --> 00:33:04,646
亲爱的?
Honey?

492
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,440
你下班以后会来接我吗?
So, you'll pick me up after work?

493
00:33:16,560 --> 00:33:17,971
好的
Okay.

494
00:33:21,640 --> 00:33:23,802
- 好吧 那 祝你今天工作愉快  - 一定
- All right, well, have a good day at work.  - I will.

495

496
00:33:27,560 --> 00:33:28,800

00:33:28,880 --> 00:33:30,689
- 拜 祝你一天顺利  - 回见 拜
- Bye, have a good day.  - See ya, bye.

498
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,171
拜
Bye.

499
00:33:37,520 --> 00:33:38,646
怎么了?
What's up?

500
00:33:40,440 --> 00:33:41,990
你觉得我应该要一个孩子吗?
Do you think I should have a baby?

501
00:33:42,040 --> 00:33:46,966
你说我会不会是一个好妈妈?
I mean, do you think I would be a good mom?

502
00:33:50,760 --> 00:33:52,285
我不知道
I don't know.

503
00:33:56,000 --> 00:33:59,700
我觉得你肯定会很投入
I mean, I think you'd be very attentive.

504
00:34:01,000 --> 00:34:03,707
- 好吧  - 可能还有点过分保护
- Okay.  - And maybe a bit overprotective.

505
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:05,807
易怒
Uptight.

506
00:34:05,920 --> 00:34:07,046
呃 谢谢了
Gee, thanks.

507
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:08,963
我只是照实说啊 我...
No, I'm just being honest, I'm...

508
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,804
这问题太难回答了 抱歉
It's a loaded question. I'm sorry.

509
00:34:11,120 --> 00:34:12,884
我觉得我会是一位出色的母亲
I think I'd be an excellent mom.

510
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:14,566
好啊
Okay.

511
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:17,806
你想让我说什么?
What do you want me to say?

512
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:21,120
别让我觉得自己糟糕透顶好不好?
How about something that doesn't make me feel like a piece of shit?

513
00:34:22,960 --> 00:34:25,725
你真他妈自私 麦洛 我算见识了
You know, you're so goddamn selfish, Milo, it's mind-blowing.

514
00:34:25,800 --> 00:34:27,040
玛姬
Maggie.

515
00:34:28,760 --> 00:34:31,286
哦 玛姬 她就是那样 很经典
Oh, that's classic Maggie, man. Classic.

516
00:34:31,360 --> 00:34:32,930
是啊 她刚才歇斯底里
Yeah, she just jumped down my throat.

517
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,365
- 很疯狂  - 你踩到地雷了 哥们
- It was crazy.  - Land mines, man.

518
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,728
就像有时候我和她在公园散步
It's like sometimes she and I will be strolling through the park

519
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:41,766
一直处得非常开心 然后 咔嘭 你知道?
laughing, getting along perfect, and then, kaboom, you know?

520
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:44,486
一个该死的地雷把我炸蒙了
A freakin' land mine blows my nuts off.

521
00:34:45,320 --> 00:34:46,321
- 你能理解么?  - 是的
- You know?  - Yeah.

522
00:34:46,400 --> 00:34:49,324
我心想说"刚才我的坚果就在这儿啊"
And I'll think, "Oh, I could've sworn my nuts were there a minute ago."

523
00:34:50,440 --> 00:34:51,646
"不知道它们被炸哪儿去了"
"I wonder where they went."

524
00:34:51,720 --> 00:34:53,688
- 没有坚果诶  - 哦 在那儿呢
- No nuts.  - Oh, there they are.

525
00:34:53,920 --> 00:34:55,649
它们被炸飞出房间
They got blown clear across the room.

526
00:34:55,720 --> 00:34:58,485
正顺着那墙滑下来 我的坚果
They're sliding down that wall over there. My nuts.

527
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,729
但是后来我仔细一想
And then, you know, when I think about it,

528
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:04,649
可能是我犯错在先 所以我就跟她道歉
it was probably my fault in the first place, so I'll just apologize to her.

529
00:35:05,280 --> 00:35:08,841
大概我之前说了一些愚蠢或者伤人的话
I probably said something stupid or insensitive,

530
00:35:09,680 --> 00:35:13,401
所以我就告诉她我很抱歉 然后就好了
so I'll just tell her that I was sorry, and then it's fine.

531
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:19,204
小心地雷 兄弟
Land mines, dude.

532
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:24,001
你在这里啊
There she is.

533
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:26,563
你的车准备好了
Your chariot awaits.

534
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:33,449
好吧 我错了
All right, look, I'm sorry.

535
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,330
我是个傻瓜
I'm an idiot.

536
00:35:35,400 --> 00:35:36,606
还有什么我不知道的?
So what else is new?

537
00:35:36,920 --> 00:35:39,446
你会成为一个出色的母亲 好吗?
You'd make an amazing mother, okay?

538
00:35:40,360 --> 00:35:42,567
可是我易怒
I thought I was too uptight.

539
00:35:42,800 --> 00:35:45,203
我刚才那样说是为了回避你真正的问题
I just said that so I didn't have to talk

540
00:35:45,216 --> 00:35:48,204
你的病态肥胖症
about the real issue, which is your morbid obesity.

541
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:52,091
我很吃惊你居然出得去屋子
I'm surprised you can even leave the house.

542
00:35:56,640 --> 00:35:58,404
你上次洗牙是什么时候?
When was the last time you had your teeth cleaned?

543
00:35:58,560 --> 00:36:00,324
- 不 不 不 不 不 不  - 来嘛
- No. No, no, no, no, no.  - Come on.

544
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:03,051
- 不要  - 嘿 我可是有执照的牙科保健师
- No.  - Hey, I am a licensed dental hygienist.

545
00:36:03,120 --> 00:36:04,360
你不想看看我怎么工作的?
Don't you want to see me work?

546
00:36:04,440 --> 00:36:05,601
不想
No.

547
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:17,723
星球那么多 时间却很少
There are so many planets, yet so little time.

548
00:36:17,800 --> 00:36:19,290
好了 我要把这个摘下来
All right, okay, I'm gonna take this.

549
00:36:19,360 --> 00:36:21,488
- 等等 你干嘛?  - 麦洛 别闹了
- Wait, what are you doing?  - Milo, that's enough.

550
00:36:21,560 --> 00:36:24,006
- 等等 等等 我还没看完呢  - 正经点 快松手
- Wait, wait, wait. I'm not done yet. - Come on, seriously, let go.

551
00:36:24,080 --> 00:36:25,445
松手
Let go.

552
00:36:25,520 --> 00:36:27,010
- 我没完呢  - 别闹了
- I'm not done.  - Stop.

553
00:36:29,920 --> 00:36:32,491
- 好了 准备好没?  - 稍等 好了
- Okay, okay, are you ready?  - I'm sorry. Okay.

554
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:35,006
洗牙需要很小心
'Cause this is serious stuff here.

555
00:36:45,200 --> 00:36:46,964
再漱几秒
A few more seconds.

556
00:36:51,280 --> 00:36:52,964
把那个给我! 给我
Give that to me! Give it to me.

557
00:36:53,200 --> 00:36:55,646
吐出来 吐那里边
Spit. Spit in there.

558
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,600
- 不好意思 我觉得这个坏了  - 哦 我的...
- Sorry, I think this is broken.  - Oh, my...

559
00:36:59,120 --> 00:37:01,122
麦洛 住手
Milo, stop.

560
00:37:01,480 --> 00:37:04,080
你得把那东西修好
That thing, you gotta have that thing fixed.

561
00:37:04,093 --> 00:37:04,962
天啊!
My God!

562
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:08,010
你知道吗? 你别总那么正经
You know what? You need to take the edge off.

563
00:37:09,680 --> 00:37:11,205
好吧 没办法
Yeah, right. No.

564
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:16,000
大家都在搞怪 你要是不活泼点 以后就没人跟你说话了
Everybody's doing it. If you don't do it, no one will ever talk to you.

565
00:37:16,040 --> 00:37:17,280
我不干
I'm not doing it.

566
00:37:17,360 --> 00:37:22,241
罗斯和蒂娜 还有艾米丽和凯西都这么做
Ross is doing it, Tina's doing it, Emily's doing it, Casey's doing it.

567
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:23,970
- 莎伦也会搞怪  - 莎伦肯定不会搞怪
- Shannon is doing it.  - Shannon cannot be doing it.

568
00:37:24,040 --> 00:37:28,329
- 还有埃里克·T和埃里克·S  - 还有埃里克·T和埃里克·S?
- Eric T. and Eric S.  - Eric T. and Eric S., too?

569
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:31,165
埃里克·T和埃里克·S都会这样做
Eric S. and Eric T. are both doing it.

570
00:37:32,840 --> 00:37:33,966
我不干
I'm not doing it.

571
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:36,806
我要很认真地问你个问题
I have a very serious question for you.

572
00:37:37,840 --> 00:37:39,968
你能跟我去舞会吗?
Will you go to prom with me?

573
00:37:45,480 --> 00:37:47,084
我觉得你要放屁
I think you're gassy.

574
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,401
不会打疼的 准备好了?
It's okay, this won't hurt. Ready?

575
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:13,363
- 疼吗?  - 你胳膊肘撞到我肉了
- That hurt?  - Your elbow went into my arm muscle.

576
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:15,010
"你的胳膊肘撞到我肉了 先生"
"Your elbow went into my arm muscle, mister."

577
00:38:15,080 --> 00:38:17,731
"你的胳膊肘撞到我肉了 先生"
"Your elbow went into my arm muscle, mister."

578
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:20,565
"哦 这下我没法送报纸了"
"Oh, my paper route's gonna be screwed."

579
00:38:29,400 --> 00:38:31,209
我要出去了
I'm getting out of here.

580
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:50,687
- 这笑话不错  - 谢了
- That was a good joke.  - Thanks.

581
00:38:51,160 --> 00:38:53,481
- 有件事情我要告诉你 玛姬  - 什么?
- I have to tell you something, Maggie.  - What?

582
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:55,329
上个月在洛杉矶...
Last month in L.A...

583
00:38:58,280 --> 00:39:00,248
怎么了? 怎么了?
What? What?

584
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:02,884
我给一个女孩口交
I ate pussy.

585
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,246
什么?
What?

586
00:39:06,600 --> 00:39:08,523
- 怎么会?  - 我知道 挺不光彩的
- What?  - I know, I'm not proud of it.

587
00:39:08,600 --> 00:39:11,285
为什么啊? 跟谁啊?
Why? How? Why? Who?

588
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:13,922
她看着像黛比·哈利年轻的时候
She looked like a young Debbie Harry.

589
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:17,482
我当时喝醉了而且很好奇 抵不住诱惑
I was drunk and curious. I just couldn't resist.

590
00:39:18,440 --> 00:39:20,124
哦 我的天啊
Oh, my gosh.

591
00:39:21,120 --> 00:39:23,487
好吧 然后... 结论是?
Well, what... How... Verdict?

592
00:39:23,960 --> 00:39:27,043
这么说吧 像体验大海
I was a little out to sea. I'll tell you that.

593
00:39:28,480 --> 00:39:32,371
体验潮湿有风暴的海
Out in a wet, stormy,

594
00:39:33,200 --> 00:39:34,964
气味刺鼻的海
pungent sea.

595
00:39:40,360 --> 00:39:43,045
- 好了 该你了  - 该我了?
- All right, now your turn.  - My turn?

596
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:46,523
我跟你说了一个秘密 你也得告诉我一个
I told you a secret. You have to tell me a secret.

597
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:51,486
- 我没有秘密  - 玛姬
- I don't have any secrets.  - Maggie.

598
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:54,484
玛姬·迪恩
Maggie Dean.

599
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:00,689
我在节育
I'm on birth control.

600
00:40:01,800 --> 00:40:03,245
真的吗?
Really?

601
00:40:04,440 --> 00:40:05,885
是的
Yeah.

602
00:40:06,440 --> 00:40:09,171
我把药片藏在卫生间的小筐里
I hide it in a basket in the bathroom.

603
00:40:10,000 --> 00:40:12,789
我估计兰斯短时间内不会发现
I figure Lance won't be looking for butterfly

604
00:40:12,802 --> 00:40:14,688
药片藏在蝴蝶型香皂盒里
decorative soaps anytime soon.

605
00:40:16,360 --> 00:40:19,125
所以很糟糕
So, it's terrible.

606
00:40:21,320 --> 00:40:25,689
为什么不跟兰斯坦白说你还没准备好要孩子?
Wouldn't it be easier just to tell Lance you're not ready to have a kid?

607
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:26,841
是啊
Yeah.

608
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:29,602
那就简单多了
It would be a lot easier.

609
00:40:31,120 --> 00:40:35,409
但是情况有点复杂
But there's a little more to it than that.

610
00:40:35,720 --> 00:40:37,210
还有什么?
What?

611
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:42,642
- 真的很糟  - 什么?
- It's really bad.  - What?

612
00:40:44,280 --> 00:40:45,884
我跟我的潜水教练上床了
I slept with my scuba instructor.

613
00:40:46,080 --> 00:40:47,366
玛姬
Maggie.

614
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:49,204
我知道 听着像色情片
I know, it sounds like a porno.

615
00:40:49,360 --> 00:40:50,805
就一次?
Just once?

616
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:55,044
- 跟他吗?  - "跟他"?
- With him?  - "With him"?

617
00:40:55,360 --> 00:40:58,284
是啊 六个月前我上了一门法式烹饪课
Yeah. I took a French cooking class like six months ago.

618
00:40:58,360 --> 00:40:59,725
玛姬!
Maggie!

619
00:41:00,200 --> 00:41:04,683
还有自然摄影课... 我认识了这个人
And a nature photography course... I met this guy.

620
00:41:05,120 --> 00:41:07,282
听起来你有恋物癖
It's a fetish is what it sounds like.

621
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:11,963
如果被兰斯发现 他肯定会崩溃
If Lance finds out, it will destroy him

622
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:15,404
而我自己也没办法活下去
and I will not be able to live with myself.

623
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,403
求你说点什么
Please say something.

624
00:41:23,160 --> 00:41:25,401
也许兰斯不是你喜欢的类型
I guess Lance just doesn't do it for you.

625
00:41:25,560 --> 00:41:27,688
但是为什么呢? 他人那么好
But why? He's so great.

626
00:41:28,320 --> 00:41:34,407
他非常贴心 可爱善良 而且肯定会是一个好爸爸
He's so sweet and cute and nice and he would make such a great dad,

627
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:37,784
兰斯跟那些我约会过的混蛋们相比
and he is the polar opposite of all the assholes

628
00:41:37,797 --> 00:41:39,283
简直是天壤之别
that I'm used to dating.

629
00:41:41,880 --> 00:41:45,089
我这种荡妇不配做他的妻子
He doesn't deserve a fucking whore as a wife.

630
00:41:45,160 --> 00:41:46,520
- 你不是荡妇  - 哦 是吗?
- You're not a whore.  - Oh, really?

631
00:41:46,560 --> 00:41:48,324
- 所以请别那么说  - 那你觉得我是什么?
- So don't say that, please.  - What would you call it, then?

632
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:52,365
你是一个放纵的有荡妇倾向的家庭主妇
You're a restless housewife with whore-like tendencies.

633
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:54,645
算了吧
Shut up.

634
00:41:55,240 --> 00:41:56,571
都差不多
It doesn't help.

635
00:41:58,200 --> 00:41:59,531
你爱他吗?
Do you love him?

636
00:42:00,520 --> 00:42:02,921
是的 我爱他 他是...
Yeah, I do. He's...

637
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:06,485
他挺好的
He's good.

638
00:42:06,760 --> 00:42:08,922
也许挺好不是你的风格
Maybe good isn't your thing.

639
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:11,645
也许吧
Maybe.

640
00:42:14,520 --> 00:42:16,124
我该怎么办?
What am I gonna do?

641
00:42:16,880 --> 00:42:19,120
跟你的同性恋弟弟一起放屁怎么样?
You're gonna do a bunch of nitrous with your gay brother?

642
00:42:21,960 --> 00:42:23,769
要不要躺下聊会?
You wanna talk about this more downstairs?

643
00:42:23,840 --> 00:42:24,841
好啊
Sure.

644
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:30,608
- 哦 我后背疼  - 是啊 我的脊椎
- Oh, this hurts my back.  - Me, too, my spine.

645
00:42:30,680 --> 00:42:33,251
- 我为啥要说"躺下聊会"?  - 不知道
- Why did I say, "Let's talk downstairs"?  - I don't know.

646
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:39,811
- 等一下 几点了?  - 不知道
- Wait, what time is it?  - I don't know.

647
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:41,725
该死
Shit.

648
00:42:42,720 --> 00:42:44,848
- 怎么了?  - 快点 我们得走了
- What?  - Come on, we gotta go.

649
00:42:44,920 --> 00:42:47,127
- 为什么?  - 我要去见个人
- Why?  - I have a meeting.

650
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:48,565
你要去见个人? 见谁?
You have a meeting? With who?

651
00:42:48,640 --> 00:42:52,850
高中的凯文·克兰西
With Kevin Clancy from high school.

652
00:42:53,200 --> 00:42:54,850
- 真的吗?  - 是的
- Really?  - Yeah.

653
00:42:55,160 --> 00:42:56,764
不错 我能去吗?
Cool. Can I come?

654
00:42:58,760 --> 00:43:03,448
不要 我觉得他希望是那种一对一的会面
No. I think he wanted to make it kind of like a one-on-one kind of meeting.

655
00:43:04,040 --> 00:43:05,929
- 很奇怪吧 抱歉  - 没事
- Is that weird? I'm sorry.  - No.

656
00:43:06,000 --> 00:43:07,047
- 不要紧  - 可以吗?
- No, it's fine.  - Is that cool?

657
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:08,485
- 嗯 嗯 嗯  - 那我们快走吧
- Yeah, yeah, yeah.  - All right, we gotta go, though.

658
00:43:08,560 --> 00:43:09,766
走吧
We gotta go.

659
00:43:11,000 --> 00:43:12,684
天啊! 我不行了
Oh, my God! You're killing me.

660
00:43:12,760 --> 00:43:14,922
别别别 听这个 就好像说"麦尔维尔 兄弟 拜托"
No, no, no, but, listen, it's like, "Melville, dude, please,

661
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,288
"拜托你就写一个人捕鲸鱼的故事"
"just write me a story about a whale, a guy who catches a whale."

662
00:43:18,360 --> 00:43:22,126
"你干嘛要费八百页写捕鲸的历史"
"Why does it have to be 800 pages of the history of whaling"

663
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:24,601
"还有那些狗屁的存在危机?"
"and all this existential crisis bullshit?"

664
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:30,687
就像一篇很奇怪搞笑丰富鲜活的文章从来没人看一样
Like, who gives a shit when the writing is that weird and funny and rich and alive

665
00:43:30,760 --> 00:43:31,966
我提到"奇怪的"了吗?
and did I mention weird?

666
00:43:32,320 --> 00:43:33,606
不过你明白我的意思对吧? 除非与社会阶层有关
You know what I mean, though? But with class.

667
00:43:33,680 --> 00:43:35,284
或者矫揉造作 矫揉造作
And pretentious. And pretentious.

668
00:43:35,600 --> 00:43:40,208
有一份白鲸的插图画我觉得你会喜欢
There's a great Moby Dick illustrated that I think you'd love.

669
00:43:40,360 --> 00:43:43,364
- 最后是一张出水的鲸鱼  - 去你的
- There's a pop-up whale at the end.  - Fuck you.

670
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,889
我给过你鲸鱼是吧?
Didn't I give you a whale?

671
00:43:47,960 --> 00:43:51,156
我记得给过 是一个铜质小雕像
I feel like I gave you, like, a copper figurine

672
00:43:51,169 --> 00:43:53,842
送你的生日礼物 我是在...
for your birthday that I got at that...

673
00:43:55,800 --> 00:43:58,531
哇哦! 你随身带着?
Wow! You carry that with you?

674
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:03,011
我猜它可能会带来好运气之类的
I don't know. It's, like, a little good luck charm or something.

675
00:44:04,040 --> 00:44:06,327
没错
Well, it's working.

676
00:44:07,520 --> 00:44:09,329
- 是吗? 我不确定  - 是的
- Is it? I don't know if it is.  - Yeah.

677
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:11,289
没错 洛杉矶经纪人之星
Yeah, Mr. Fancy L.A. Agent.

678
00:44:12,080 --> 00:44:14,321
这鲸鱼我应该自己留着
I should've kept that whale for myself.

679
00:44:14,400 --> 00:44:16,323
没什么大不了的 他不是知名经纪人
It's not that big of a deal. He's not that big of an agent.

680
00:44:16,400 --> 00:44:18,368
我觉得很了不起
I think it's incredible.

681
00:44:21,480 --> 00:44:25,041
我早就知道你的人生会很精彩
I always knew you'd do something amazing with your life.

682
00:44:27,240 --> 00:44:29,242
我为你自豪 麦洛
I'm proud of you, Milo.

683
00:44:32,320 --> 00:44:33,651
你想离开这里吗?
Do you wanna get out of here?

684
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:43,610
那些龙虾箱子能把人打倒
Those lobster cages can knock you right off.

685
00:44:44,040 --> 00:44:45,040
你说什么?
What?

686
00:44:45,080 --> 00:44:47,367
实际上应该叫龙虾罐
Well, actually, they're called lobster pots,

687
00:44:47,440 --> 00:44:49,807
但它们能把这些人打下甲板
but they can knock these guys right off the deck.

688
00:44:49,880 --> 00:44:51,769
真的很危险
They're real dangerous.

689
00:44:53,840 --> 00:44:55,285
我觉得那些是螃蟹
I think those are crabs.

690
00:44:55,440 --> 00:44:58,125
- 在哪里?  - 电视上那些
- Where?  - Everywhere.

691
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:01,050
哦 可能是吧
Oh, yeah, maybe they are.

692
00:45:01,800 --> 00:45:02,961
不 那就是螃蟹
No, they are.

693
00:45:04,720 --> 00:45:06,484
麦洛最近怎么样?
So, how's Milo working out?

694
00:45:06,560 --> 00:45:11,407
挺好的 他是在尽最大努力 但是他... 他在努力
Good. He's definitely doing his best, but he's been... He's trying.

695
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:13,006
那就好
Good.

696
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:21,365
我爱你
I love you.

697
00:45:21,920 --> 00:45:23,570
我也爱你
I love you, too.

698
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:25,444
我真的爱你
I really love you.

699
00:45:26,800 --> 00:45:28,290
谢谢
Thank you.

700
00:45:46,160 --> 00:45:48,049
天啊 我不敢相信他都十六岁了
God, I can't believe he's 16.

701
00:45:50,480 --> 00:45:53,450
有个这么大的孩子很奇怪
It's strange, man. Having a kid that old.

702
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:56,084
他刚刚考了驾照
He just got his license.

703
00:45:56,160 --> 00:45:58,322
我心想"真的吗?"
I'm like, "Really?"

704
00:45:58,960 --> 00:46:00,962
"我老到孩子都能开车了?"
"I'm old enough to have a kid who can drive?"

705
00:46:01,960 --> 00:46:03,485
天啊!
My God!

706
00:46:04,680 --> 00:46:08,002
你儿子知道我跟你的事吗?
Does he know about me and you?

707
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:10,005
不知道 天啊 当然不知道
No, no, God, no.

708
00:46:11,800 --> 00:46:13,165
他知道我曾经教书
He knows I used to teach

709
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:17,484
有时候他问我为什么不教了 但是...
and sometimes he asks why I stopped, you know, but...

710
00:46:17,840 --> 00:46:19,683
你怎么跟他说的?
What do you tell him?

711
00:46:20,360 --> 00:46:22,362
我说我不适合教书
That it wasn't my thing.

712
00:46:24,120 --> 00:46:25,173
抱歉 里奇
I'm sorry, Rich.

713
00:46:25,186 --> 00:46:27,966
不 麦洛 你根本不需要道歉
No, Milo, you don't ever have to apologize.

714
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:31,483
你什么也没做错 你明白吗?
You didn't do anything wrong. You understand me?

715
00:46:35,240 --> 00:46:36,366
好的
Okay.

716
00:46:42,240 --> 00:46:46,802
我知道我们的关系奇怪糟糕而且违法
Look, I know what happened was weird and illegal and shit,

717
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:50,043
但这对我很重要
but it really meant something to me.

718
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:54,689
我们是成年人
And we're adults.

719
00:46:55,520 --> 00:46:57,284
我现在是成年人了
Well, I'm an adult.

720
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:04,167
天啊 我感觉像是新生在邀请大四的跳舞
God, I feel like the freshman asking the senior to the dance.

721
00:47:04,920 --> 00:47:07,764
这就是问题 有...
That's part of the problem. There's...

722
00:47:07,840 --> 00:47:12,687
我们之间就像高低年级 总有差距
There's a freshman/senior dynamic between us.

723
00:47:14,760 --> 00:47:16,728
可以没有的
There doesn't have to be.

724
00:47:20,080 --> 00:47:22,686
麦洛 起床 兰斯十分钟以后就走了
Milo, get up. Lance is leaving in 10 minutes.

725
00:47:24,360 --> 00:47:25,850
麦洛?
Milo?

726
00:47:33,920 --> 00:47:35,729
麦洛 是你手机响吗?
Milo, is that your phone?

727
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:38,406
哦 该死 几点了?
Oh, shit, what time is it?

728
00:47:39,200 --> 00:47:40,247
九点多
It's after 9:00.

729
00:47:40,320 --> 00:47:42,926
该死 我迟到了
Fuck, I'm late for work.

730
00:47:43,000 --> 00:47:44,604
咱俩都迟到了
You and me both.

731
00:47:46,840 --> 00:47:48,968
这个给你
So, here.

732
00:47:52,160 --> 00:47:55,482
- "曼哈顿日出" - 这是部浪漫喜剧
- "Sunrise in Manhattan." - It's a romantic comedy.

733
00:47:55,600 --> 00:47:59,366
- 有关什么的 巴尔扎克和福柯?  - 不是 其实情节很简单
- About what, Balzac and Foucault?  - No, it's actually pretty straightforward.

734
00:47:59,480 --> 00:48:03,724
就像是詹妮弗·安妮斯顿或者凯特·哈德森演的那种
I wrote it for, you know, like, Jennifer Aniston or Kate Hudson.

735
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:05,848
我不想太冒昧
And I don't want to be presumptuous,

736
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:07,729
但是我觉得如果你想看
but I thought, you know, if you wanted to read it

737
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:11,805
或者你喜欢的话 顺便帮我拿给你经纪人看看?
and maybe if you liked it, you could pass it along to your agent?

738
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:14,449
好的 好的 没问题
Yeah, okay. Yeah, totally.

739
00:48:14,520 --> 00:48:16,329
- 当然 我很乐意...  - 太好了
- Yeah, I could totally...  - Cool.

740
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,084
帮你交过去如果... 我会读的
Pass it on if... I'll read it.

741
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:19,525
- 那太棒了  - 嗯
- Cool.  - Yeah.

742
00:48:20,200 --> 00:48:22,601
我有点儿... 我想你应该走了
I kind of... I need you to leave.

743
00:48:22,680 --> 00:48:24,409
好 嗯 当然
Okay. Yeah, sure.

744
00:48:25,400 --> 00:48:27,402
- 昨晚很开心  - 是啊
- Last night was fun.  - Yeah.

745
00:48:27,720 --> 00:48:30,405
有点昨日重现的感觉啊
Kind of a blast from the past.

746
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:34,367
嗯 还有... 走的时候别忘了锁门
Yeah, and... make sure the door locks when you close it.

747
00:48:43,080 --> 00:48:45,447
迪恩小姐 你好啊
Greetings, Ms. Dean.

748
00:48:45,520 --> 00:48:47,010
什么风把你吹来了?
What brings you around these parts?

749
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:49,731
那是个错误
It was a mistake.

750
00:48:51,800 --> 00:48:52,847
好吧
All right.

751
00:48:53,120 --> 00:48:55,202
我的意思是 所有的一切 都是错误
I mean it, the whole thing.

752
00:48:55,680 --> 00:48:57,011
好吧
Fine.

753
00:48:57,840 --> 00:48:58,887

Is that all?

754
00:48:59,360 --> 00:49:01,488

I was a little late. Lance understood.

766
00:49:57,760 --> 00:49:59,683
麦洛 你得学会把你的日子安排得井井有条
You have to get your shit together, Milo.

767
00:49:59,800 --> 00:50:02,007
这话从你嘴里说出来真是有点稀罕
That is a very interesting statement coming from you.

768
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:03,764
- 你知道吗?  - 什么?
- You know what?  - What?

00:53:58,040 --> 00:53:59,485
嗯 等下
Yeah, hold on.

817
00:54:00,080 --> 00:54:02,651
爸 门口有人找
Dad, some guy's at the door for you.

818
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:07,441
抱歉 我以为你只有...
I'm sorry, I thought you had him...

819
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:09,090
你干嘛? 你不能来这里
What are you doing? You can't be here.

820
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:10,491
我儿子在这儿
That's my kid in there.

821
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:11,921
好吧 我以为你只有周末才会接他过来
Okay, I thought you only had him on the weekends.

822
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:14,162
我有我的生活 麦洛 一个完整的生活
I have a life, Milo. A whole life.

823
00:54:26,680 --> 00:54:28,523
给我来一杯金快活龙舌兰 谢谢
Give me a shot of Cuervo, please.

824
00:54:35,080 --> 00:54:36,764
再来一杯 成么?
Can I have another one, please?

825
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:52,291
嘿
Hey.

826
00:55:53,600 --> 00:55:54,965
你在这儿干什么?
What are you doing up here?

827
00:55:56,720 --> 00:55:58,927
我在等你啊 警察大哥
I'm waiting for you, Mr. Big Officer Man.

828
00:56:00,000 --> 00:56:01,445
你胡说八道些什么?
The fuck you say?

829
00:56:02,120 --> 00:56:03,690
谢谢 真的非常感谢
Thank you. Thank you very much.

830
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:05,171
没事儿 好好照顾他
No problem. Take care, now.

831
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:06,730
谢谢
Thanks.

832
00:56:11,680 --> 00:56:12,886
玛姬 别害怕
Maggie, don't freak out.

833
00:56:12,960 --> 00:56:14,121
怎么了?
What is going on?

834
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:15,726
你不会懂的
You wouldn't understand.

835
00:56:16,000 --> 00:56:18,651
试着跟我说说吧 说不定我能理解呢
Try me. You might be surprised.

836
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:23,845
我很沮丧 还做了不少蠢事 就这样
I get depressed about my life and I do stupid things. That's it.

837
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:26,209
生活中我们都会难过 麦洛
We all get sad about our lives, Milo.

838
00:56:26,320 --> 00:56:28,049
但那并不意味着我们可以跳楼
That doesn't mean we go jumping off of rooftops.

839
00:56:28,120 --> 00:56:29,326
我没打算跳
I wasn't gonna jump.

840
00:56:29,440 --> 00:56:30,680
好吧 可是我怎么知道呢?
Okay, well, how do I know that?

841
00:56:30,840 --> 00:56:32,490
好吧 对不起
Okay, I'm sorry.

842
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:40,609
我真是无法接受 麦洛 我现在无法接受 我做不到
I can't take this, Milo. I can't right now. I can't.

843
00:56:40,880 --> 00:56:42,006
嘿 对不起
Hey, I'm sorry.

844
00:56:47,400 --> 00:56:49,687
你还记得咱们八年级时候的那个贾斯汀·梅尔?
Do you remember Justin Meyer in eighth grade?

845
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:53,128
乔克 那傻逼 那时候老和我过不去的那个?
Jock, asshole, he used to fuck with me all the time?

846
00:56:53,200 --> 00:56:57,205
老爸 他跟我说... 他说 "贾斯汀这样的人 "
Dad, he told me... He said, "Guys like Justin,

847
00:56:58,160 --> 00:57:01,209
这样的人 高中就是他们能达到的最高水平
like, high school is the best it's ever gonna get for them.

848
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,729
他们在高中达到人生顶峰
They're gonna peak in high school,

849
00:57:03,800 --> 00:57:08,124
然后余生都在走下坡路 一事无成 "
and the rest of their life is just gonna be a disappointment. "

850
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:10,610
但是像我这样的孩子
And that kids like me,

851
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:15,004
会在高中以后才开始发光发热 
that I would soar after high school. 

852
00:57:17,320 --> 00:57:18,481
而且 事实上 我可以坐在这里
And, in fact, I would sit there,

853
00:57:18,560 --> 00:57:20,801
想象十年后的未来
I would fast-forward 10 years into the future

854
00:57:20,880 --> 00:57:24,566
想象在我们的高中同学会上
and I would think about our high school reunion

855
00:57:24,640 --> 00:57:31,125
我再次遇到贾斯汀 他变得又胖又秃
and seeing Justin, and he would just be this fat, balding guy

856
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:34,966
就像 你能想象的 就像那些运动商店的服务员
who, you know, is the assistant manager at some sporting goods store,

857
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:40,723
而我 则会成为有名的演员
and I would be this famous actor

858
00:57:40,960 --> 00:57:44,965
住在洛杉矶 或者纽约 然后有一个同样英俊的男友
who lives in L.A. or New York and I have this beautiful boyfriend.

859
00:57:46,800 --> 00:57:48,290
生活得很幸福
And I'm happy.

860
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:54,523
你知道我在网上又找到贾斯汀了吗?
Do you know I looked Justin up online?

861
00:57:56,400 --> 00:57:58,402
你知道他现在在做什么吗?
And do you know what he's doing now?

862
00:57:59,560 --> 00:58:01,085
他是个电气工程师
He's an electrician,

863
00:58:02,760 --> 00:58:07,607
他有一个漂亮媳妇和两个可爱的女儿
and he has two beautiful daughters and a pretty wife.

864
00:58:10,000 --> 00:58:11,889
他很幸福
And he's happy.

865
00:58:15,240 --> 00:58:17,004
而这一切都说明...
And it turns out that...

866
00:58:20,800 --> 00:58:24,691
这一切都说明我才是那个在高中达到顶峰的人
It just turns out that I'm the one that peaked in high school.

867
00:58:29,920 --> 00:58:32,844
你想 如果这都不让人沮丧 那...
You know, if that's not depressing, then...

868
00:58:34,520 --> 00:58:36,488
就这样吗 亲爱的?
So, that's it, sweetie?

869
00:58:37,000 --> 00:58:39,287
你不是个著名演员?
You're not a famous actor?

870
00:58:39,920 --> 00:58:43,129
可我得告诉你 没人是什么所谓的名演员
Cause I got news for you. No one's a famous actor.

871
00:58:43,360 --> 00:58:44,725
乔治克鲁尼就很有名
George Clooney's a famous actor.

872
00:58:44,920 --> 00:58:48,288
好吧 乔治克鲁尼 凡事总有例外
Okay, George Clooney, I guess that's one exception.

873
00:58:49,760 --> 00:58:52,764
但是余下的我们大部分人都只是芸芸众生 
But the rest of us are just walking around

874
00:58:53,480 --> 00:58:55,289
拼尽全力
trying not to be disappointed

875
00:58:55,920 --> 00:58:58,605
不让自己对自己的人生失望
with the way that our lives turned out.

876
00:59:02,240 --> 00:59:04,925
或者 我们去应对或者... 
And either we find a way to deal or...

877
00:59:09,360 --> 00:59:13,490
我只是想确定 你不会离开我
I need to know you're not gonna check out on me.

878
00:59:16,560 --> 00:59:18,289
我会尽力的
I'll do my best.

879
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:37,090
什么?
What?

880
00:59:46,840 --> 00:59:47,841
你在干吗?
What are you doing?

881
00:59:48,320 --> 00:59:50,448
肯定就放在这里面
It's got to be in here somewhere.

882
00:59:52,880 --> 00:59:55,406
哦 上帝啊!
Oh, my God!

883
00:59:58,840 --> 00:59:59,841
哇哦!
Wow!

884
01:00:00,280 --> 01:00:02,203
在这儿! 我找到了!
Oh, here it is! I found it!

885
01:00:02,640 --> 01:00:04,642
天啊! 你还留着这种东西?
Oh, my God! You still have that thing?

886
01:00:05,720 --> 01:00:07,688
- 咱们该走了  - 啥?
- We're going out.  - What?

887
01:00:07,760 --> 01:00:10,445
今天是万圣节 兰斯有一场虚拟足球赛
It is Halloween, Lance is at fantasy football,

888
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:13,410
我说你会盛装出席 要么漂亮 要么逗逼
I say you put on something pretty and/or freaky.

889
01:00:13,600 --> 01:00:14,886
当然最好两个都有
Preferably both.

890
01:00:14,960 --> 01:00:16,246
好啊
Yeah.

891
01:00:16,800 --> 01:00:18,529
我自己能画得更好
I can do this better myself.

892
01:00:18,640 --> 01:00:20,051
不要 我想给你画
No, I wanna do it.

893
01:00:22,840 --> 01:00:24,205
好啦
Okay.

894
01:00:39,760 --> 01:00:40,761
不喜欢就说
Tell me if you don't like it.

895
01:00:40,840 --> 01:00:43,207
如果我不喜欢 我会立刻告诉你
I will tell you immediately if I don't like it.

896
01:00:46,560 --> 01:00:47,641
怎么样 是不是很惊喜?
Is that a good scream?

897
01:00:47,720 --> 01:00:49,165
太意外了 我喜欢
That was a great scream. I love it.

898
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:51,322
天啊! 我简直不敢相信它竟然还合身
Oh, my God! I can't believe it still fits.

899
01:00:51,400 --> 01:00:53,084
- 我知道  - 看看我
- I know.  - Look at me.

900
01:00:53,520 --> 01:00:55,170
顺便提一句 你腿比我的好看
You have better legs than I do, by the way.

901
01:00:55,240 --> 01:00:56,366
我整个身材就像个青蛙一样
I have a body like a frog.

902
01:00:56,440 --> 01:00:57,680
- 没有啊  - 不 我有
- No, you don't.  - Yes, I do.

903
01:00:57,760 --> 01:00:59,000
什么意思?
What does that mean?

904
01:00:59,240 --> 01:01:01,049
就四肢很长 肚子很大
Just a big belly and long arms and long legs.

905
01:01:01,120 --> 01:01:02,281
就像...
Just like...

906
01:01:13,800 --> 01:01:15,609

910
01:01:22,760 --> 01:01:25,730
这还是老爸过世后我们第一次来这片墓地
We haven't done the cemetery walk since Dad died.

911
01:01:25,800 --> 01:01:27,211
我知道
I know.

912
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:28,645
天 你小心脚下
Oh, my God, watch your step.

913
01:01:29,080 --> 01:01:31,651
老天 这儿几乎没怎么变
God, it has not changed a bit.

914
01:01:31,720 --> 01:01:33,609
我在这儿拥有了人生第一个葡萄酒冷酒器
I had my first wine cooler here.

915
01:01:33,720 --> 01:01:35,848
- 跟谁?  - 詹妮·科普兰

916
01:01:37,080 --> 01:01:39,082
- 那可以理解  - 嗯

917
01:01:42,320 --> 01:01:43,845

老爸生前最喜欢万圣节了
Dad loved Halloween.

919
01:01:50,960 --> 01:01:52,086
谁不是呢?
Who can blame him?

920
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:00,805
够了
Scram.

921
01:02:01,480 --> 01:02:03,084
出去
Get out of here.

922
01:02:04,120 --> 01:02:05,201
怎么 你聋了?
What, are you deaf?

923
01:02:05,280 --> 01:02:07,965
我才没聋 这可是万圣节 白痴
I'm not deaf. It's Halloween, assholes.

924
01:02:10,680 --> 01:02:12,489
蛇精病
Fucking people.

925
01:02:18,440 --> 01:02:19,521
天啊!
Oh, my God!

926
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:22,001
等等 他们分给我们的那个...
Wait, what was the name of the...

927
01:02:23,160 --> 01:02:26,369
那个青少年精神病学家叫啥来着?
adolescent psychiatrist that they assigned us?

928
01:02:26,440 --> 01:02:28,249
- 她叫啥?  - 额 叫... 
- What was her name?  - Oh, shit.

929
01:02:28,480 --> 01:02:30,767
- 是叫玛丽?  - 应该是玛米·莫蒂默
- Mary?  - Mamie Mortimer.

930
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:33,844
- 玛米·莫蒂默  - 玛米·莫蒂默和她那些狗屁日记
- Mamie Mortimer.  - Mamie Mortimer and her fucking journals.

931
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:35,524
又肥又大的毛衣
Giant sweaters.

932
01:02:35,680 --> 01:02:37,523
毛衣怎么了?
What was with those sweaters?

933
01:02:37,680 --> 01:02:39,842
超级大! 她又不胖
Huge! She's not a big woman.

934
01:02:39,920 --> 01:02:42,764
对于玛米·莫蒂默 每一天都是圣诞节
Every day was Christmas for Mamie Mortimer.

935
01:02:42,840 --> 01:02:45,525
老天! "你们有没有把那写进日记里?"
Oh, my God! "Did you write that in your journal?"

936
01:02:45,600 --> 01:02:47,762
"没有什么是记日记解决不了的"
"There's nothing that can't be solved by journaling."

937
01:02:47,840 --> 01:02:49,922
"啊你们父亲去世了? 写在日记里"
"Oh, your dad died? Put it in a journal."

938
01:02:50,000 --> 01:02:52,640
- "你忘了 是不是?"  - "我老爸过世了 我觉得好多了"
- "You forgot about it, didn't you?"  - "My dad died, I feel better."

939
01:02:52,840 --> 01:02:54,080
不过 她的工作也不容易 
She had a tough gig, though.

940
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:55,844
我的意思是 我们不是什么好孩子
I mean, we were not good kids.

941
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:58,526
我是说 如果是你 你要怎么面对两个父亲已经不在了的孩子...
I mean, what do you do to two kids whose dad...

942
01:02:58,920 --> 01:03:01,240
- 你让他们写日记  - 是 我是说 我们当时才十四岁
- You make them keep a journal.  - Yeah, I mean, we were 14.

943
01:03:01,480 --> 01:03:04,131
神啊 我们都是忘恩负义的混蛋 是吧?
God, we were ungrateful bastards, though. Right?

944
01:03:04,520 --> 01:03:06,329
黑你自己就够了 
Speak for yourself.

945
01:03:06,760 --> 01:03:08,330
我可是天使 我不知道你在说什么
I was an angel. I don't know what you're talking about.

946
01:03:08,400 --> 01:03:09,606
玛姬
Maggie.

947
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:11,644
- "玛姬"  - 玛姬
- "Maggie."  - Maggie.

948
01:03:12,200 --> 01:03:14,123
让我... 等下 让我看看
Let me... Oh, wait. Let me see it.

949
01:03:14,480 --> 01:03:15,766
什么?
What?

950
01:03:17,800 --> 01:03:19,211
我想看看你的
I want to see it.

951
01:03:19,480 --> 01:03:20,720
哦 那是什么 换了个地方?
Oh, what is that, a new place?

952
01:03:20,800 --> 01:03:22,040
不 还是老地方啊
No, it's always been here.

953
01:03:22,160 --> 01:03:25,846
哦 在这儿 跳着欢快的舞呢
Oh, there she is, dancing away.

954
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:28,964
当然
Of course she is.

955
01:03:29,200 --> 01:03:30,406
你以为我把它洗掉了?
Did you think I got rid of it?

956
01:03:30,480 --> 01:03:32,960
我不知道 你是只狡猾的鸟 小喜鹊
I don't know. You're a tricky bird, Magpie.

957
01:03:43,720 --> 01:03:46,405
我们怎么做到十年互不往来的?
How'd we go 10 years without talking?

958
01:03:46,920 --> 01:03:49,730
现在谈这个未免太煞风景
Oh, it's probably not worth talking about now.

959
01:03:50,080 --> 01:03:51,525
也对
Probably not.

960
01:04:08,040 --> 01:04:09,644
让我把帽子摘下来
Let me take my hat off.

961
01:04:09,720 --> 01:04:11,484
- 来吧  - 温柔点
- Come on.  - Be polite.

962
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:31,570
小喜鹊
Magpie.

963
01:05:33,080 --> 01:05:36,846
噢 穿礼服在小便池撒尿也没我想的那么难
Oh, peeing in a dress at a urinal is actually not that hard.

964
01:05:38,200 --> 01:05:39,201
我得走了
I'm gonna go.

965
01:05:39,720 --> 01:05:40,926
不想再跳一曲?
Do you want another round?

966
01:05:41,040 --> 01:05:42,405
我得走了
I'm gonna go.

967
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:44,486
嘿 嘿
Hey, hey.

968
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:47,009
等等 玛姬
Wait up, Maggie.

969
01:05:47,080 --> 01:05:48,491
嘿 到底怎么啦?
Hey, what's going on?

970
01:05:50,120 --> 01:05:51,565
凯文·克兰西?
Kevin Clancy?

971
01:05:52,200 --> 01:05:54,248
凯文·克兰西六年前就搬到迈阿密了
Kevin Clancy moved to Miami six years ago.

972
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:57,249
他这周末就在城里
He was in town for the weekend.

973
01:06:00,200 --> 01:06:02,009
什么? 这到底是怎么一回事?
What? What is this?

974
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:03,611
我看见你电话了
I saw your cell phone.

975
01:06:04,320 --> 01:06:06,448
你有一个未接来电 里奇·莱维特打的
You have a missed call from Rich Levitt.

976
01:06:10,200 --> 01:06:12,043
你和他上床了?
Are you sleeping with him?

977
01:06:13,880 --> 01:06:17,202
玛姬 我们有时可能有所隐瞒 但那都是可以解释的
Some of us have our secrets and some of us have our reasons, Maggie.

978
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:18,725
哇哦
Wow.

979
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:21,851
所以 怎么着 你还对那个有恋童癖的人情有独钟?
So, what, you're still attracted to child molesters?

980
01:06:21,920 --> 01:06:23,331
是吗?
Is that it?

981
01:06:23,720 --> 01:06:24,760
他不是恋童癖
He's not a child molester.

982
01:06:24,800 --> 01:06:27,724
你那个时候十五岁 他又是你的英语老师
You were 15 and he was your English teacher.

983
01:06:27,800 --> 01:06:28,961
你没看到他是怎么对我的
You didn't see the way he treated me.

984
01:06:29,040 --> 01:06:32,169
- 他想上你  - 你有什么资格来批评我?
- He wanted to fuck you.  - Who are you to judge, okay?

985
01:06:32,240 --> 01:06:34,680
你五年级开始就有男朋友了 对吧?
You've had boyfriends since you were in the fifth grade, okay?

986
01:06:34,760 --> 01:06:36,888
我那个时候十五岁了 还从来没被别人亲过
I was 15. I had never been kissed before.

987
01:06:37,280 --> 01:06:39,681
- 他是我老师又怎样?  - 又怎样?
- So what if he was my teacher?  - So what?

988
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:41,762
他让我感觉很好! 他让我喜欢自己!
He made me feel good! He made me feel good about myself!

989
01:06:41,840 --> 01:06:44,764
我不想听你说他让你感觉怎么样 你知道吗?
I don't want to hear how he made you feel. You know what?

990
01:06:44,840 --> 01:06:48,083
你想和里奇·莱维特交往 那你去吧 我不拦你
You wanna go hang out with Rich Levitt, go ahead. I am not gonna stop you.

991
01:06:48,160 --> 01:06:52,609
但我知道 当这一切都结束了 再回头看 你会发现我是正确的
But when all that shit went down, I know, looking back, I was right.

992
01:06:52,760 --> 01:06:54,922
我不能再为此感到内疚了
And I can't feel guilty about it anymore.

993
01:06:55,760 --> 01:06:57,205
事情还有可能会更糟
And it could've been a lot worse.

994
01:06:57,280 --> 01:06:58,770
他差点就进监狱了啊 麦洛
He could've gone to fucking jail, Milo.

995
01:06:58,840 --> 01:06:59,966
你知道吗?
Do you realize that?

996
01:07:00,040 --> 01:07:01,849
我们私下处理这件事是他的幸运
He is lucky that we dealt with this quietly.

997
01:07:01,920 --> 01:07:04,207
我知道你怪罪我 我也知道
And I know you blame me, and I know you think

998
01:07:04,280 --> 01:07:06,851
你觉得我毁了你和他之间的这段热烈的感情
I ruined this blossoming relationship between you and him.

999
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:09,531
我知道你觉得我毁了他的生活 你的生活
I know you think I ruined his life, that I ruined your life,

1000
01:07:10,040 --> 01:07:11,041
但我只是做了我该做的事
but I did what I had to do.

1001
01:07:11,120 --> 01:07:13,521
听着 这和你无关
Look, it had nothing to do with you.

1002
01:07:13,600 --> 01:07:15,045
这都是瞎扯淡
That is bullshit.

1003
01:07:17,120 --> 01:07:18,406
你是我的弟弟
You're my brother.

1004
01:07:21,880 --> 01:07:23,882
我们应该互相支持对方
And we're supposed to be there for each other.

1005
01:07:25,120 --> 01:07:28,124
如果你到现在还不明白这一点
And if you don't get that by now, then,

1006
01:07:29,240 --> 01:07:31,129
那我想我还是再等十年再来和你说话吧
I don't know, I guess I'll talk to you in another 10 years.

1007
01:07:31,200 --> 01:07:33,009
- 玛姬 等等  - 这糟透了
- Maggie, wait.  - This sucks.

1008
01:07:34,320 --> 01:07:36,971
我今晚和你在一起真的很开心
I was having such a good night with you.

1009
01:08:06,120 --> 01:08:07,770
星期天 星期一 星期二...
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday...

1010
01:08:10,760 --> 01:08:12,410
星期天 星期一...
Sunday, Monday...

1011
01:08:15,160 --> 01:08:16,889
我靠
Oh, shit.

1012
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:44,962
- 早上好  - 早上好
- Morning, chief.  - Morning.

1013
01:08:45,320 --> 01:08:48,051
看样子你的姐姐倒下了
Well, looks like your sis is down for the count.

1014
01:08:48,120 --> 01:08:51,522
我觉得她大概是食物中毒了
I think she's got, like, food poisoning or something.

1015
01:08:52,120 --> 01:08:53,770
是啊 或者是别的事
Right, or something.

1016
01:08:53,840 --> 01:08:55,569
我们应该来一个"兄弟日"
Maybe we should have a dude's day.

1017
01:08:55,880 --> 01:08:58,645
- 什么?  - 你懂的 "兄弟日"
- A what?  - You know, dude's day.

1018
01:09:00,840 --> 01:09:02,330
我感觉你口中的兄弟日
I think your version of dude's day

1019
01:09:02,400 --> 01:09:05,609
和我心中的兄弟日完全是两个概念
and my version of dude's day are totally different.

1020
01:09:11,400 --> 01:09:12,481
我靠
Oh, shit.

1021
01:09:13,560 --> 01:09:15,085
我靠!
Oh, shit!

1022
01:09:15,480 --> 01:09:17,403
加油啊 兄弟 你差点就成功了
Come on, man. You almost had it that time.

1023
01:09:17,720 --> 01:09:21,122
兰斯 这护具卡到我的蛋蛋了
Lance, this harness has my balls in my fucking throat.

1024
01:09:21,200 --> 01:09:22,247
我能下来了吗?
Can I please come down?

1025
01:09:22,320 --> 01:09:24,561
要的就是这体验 小兄弟
It's all part of the experience, buddy boy.

1026
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:28,851
这东西唯一的好处就是可以看到这里那么多的美男
The only good thing about this experience is that every guy in here's gorgeous.

1027
01:09:28,920 --> 01:09:30,331
是啊 这里很棒
Yeah, it's great here, man.

1028
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:32,721
你身边有一大群的肌肉男 太美了
You're surrounded by a bunch of hunks. It's beautiful.

1029
01:09:33,080 --> 01:09:35,765
加油啊 你得化疼痛为力量
Come on, you gotta use the pain. Get inspired by it.

1030
01:09:35,880 --> 01:09:38,531
你是谁啊? 难道你是攀岩界的法西斯?
What are you, some sort of, like, climbing Nazi?

1031
01:09:38,600 --> 01:09:40,125
我相信你 仅此而已
I just believe in you, that's all.

1032
01:09:40,200 --> 01:09:42,009
我看到你在公园里的样子了
Come on, I saw you out there working at the park.

1033
01:09:42,080 --> 01:09:43,684
你能做到的 兄弟 我相信你
You got it in you, dude. I believe in you.

1034
01:09:43,760 --> 01:09:46,445
- 加油  - 你真是一坨屎啊 兰斯
- Come on.  - You're such a piece of shit, Lance.

1035
01:09:47,920 --> 01:09:49,968
好啊 太棒了
Yeah, awesome. Awesome.

1036
01:09:50,080 --> 01:09:52,686
就这样 继续保持 兄弟
Just keep doing it just like that, man.

1037
01:09:54,800 --> 01:09:57,280
就是要这样嘛! 兄弟 你太棒了!
That's what I'm talking about! Boo-ya, dude!

1038
01:09:57,800 --> 01:09:59,484
- 敬"兄弟日" - 敬"兄弟日"
- To dude's day.  - To dude's day.

1039
01:09:59,960 --> 01:10:04,284
我得说 你刚刚就和我中学里的体育老师一样
I gotta tell you, you were channeling my middle school P.E. teacher out there.

1040
01:10:04,360 --> 01:10:06,249
你喜欢吗?
Yeah, you were into it, huh?

1041
01:10:07,120 --> 01:10:09,156
是啊 这很... 你很能激励人
Yeah, it was very... You're very motivating.

1042
01:10:09,169 --> 01:10:09,851
谢谢
Thank you.

1043
01:10:09,920 --> 01:10:11,604
你会成为一个好爸爸的 挺好的
You're gonna be a good dad someday. That was good.

1044
01:10:11,680 --> 01:10:12,727
谢谢你 兄弟
Thanks, man.

1045
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:14,211
挺有趣的 我的朋友们
It's funny, 'cause all my buddies,

1046
01:10:14,280 --> 01:10:16,886
他们都被当爸爸这事把屎都吓出来了
they're scared shitless about the whole fatherhood thing,

1047
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:19,804
我知道我已经准备好了
and, yeah, I just know that I'm ready for it.

1048
01:10:20,320 --> 01:10:24,041
所以这一切关于怀孕的事才那么让人泄气 你懂吗?
That's why the whole pregnancy thing has been frustrating, you know?

1049
01:10:24,120 --> 01:10:27,522
我只是想知道我的努力没有白费 你懂吗?
Just wanna make sure I'm not firing blanks, you know?

1050
01:10:27,840 --> 01:10:28,921
是啊
Right.

1051
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:30,570
我猜是我想太多了吧
Guess I'm just a little paranoid.

1052
01:10:33,320 --> 01:10:37,245
你注意到她最近表现有点奇怪吗?
Have you noticed her acting a little strange at all lately?

1053
01:10:37,320 --> 01:10:39,800
我是说...
Like, I mean...

1054
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:43,649
我也不知道怎么说
I don't know what I mean.

1055
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:45,411
我知道 是的
I know what you mean, yeah.

1056
01:10:45,480 --> 01:10:47,721
我感觉她能在夏威夷怀孕 我有这种预感
It'll all happen in Hawaii. That's how I feel.

1057
01:10:47,800 --> 01:10:50,963
信风吹过棕榈树之间
Just in between the trade winds and the palm trees

1058
01:10:51,040 --> 01:10:56,171
那里的人 也有一种异域风情
and the people and, you know, exotic spices.

1059
01:10:56,280 --> 01:10:57,361
是啊
Yeah.

1060
01:10:57,480 --> 01:10:58,891
也许我们可以在吊床里面做
Maybe we'll do it in a hammock.

1061
01:11:00,520 --> 01:11:02,648
夏威夷绝对是造人的好地方
Hawaii's definitely baby-making country.

1062
01:11:04,840 --> 01:11:09,323
玛姬有时候有很多秘密
You know, Maggie can be very secretive.

1063
01:11:09,720 --> 01:11:10,881
比如 当我们还是小孩子的时候
Like, when we were kids and stuff,

1064
01:11:10,960 --> 01:11:14,521
她会在屋子的不同地方藏香烟和别的东西
she would hide cigarettes and things like that around the house.

1065
01:11:16,560 --> 01:11:19,040
都是一些你想不到的地方
You know, places you wouldn't think to look.

1066
01:11:19,640 --> 01:11:23,326
也许她在吃一些药物 对这事有点影响
Maybe there's some medication or something that's affecting things.

1067
01:11:24,040 --> 01:11:25,041
这只是一个想法
Just a thought.

1068
01:11:26,280 --> 01:11:29,204
我觉得这种事玛姬不会瞒着我的
Yeah, I don't think Maggie'd hide something like that from me.

1069
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:32,444
- 我肯定你是对的  - 是啊
- I'm sure you're right.  - Yeah.

1070
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:45,041
嘿 小姐 需要帮忙吗?
Hey, miss, do you need help with anything?

1071
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:50,406
嗯 其实 我... 我只是...
Yeah, you know what? I'm... I just...

1072
01:11:52,040 --> 01:11:53,280
我的那个来得有点迟了
I'm a little late.

1073
01:11:53,360 --> 01:11:54,725
但不是迟到了很久 只是有一点
But not seriously late, just a little.

1074
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:57,167
但我... 其实 我不需要用这个
But I'm... You know what? I don't need this.

1075
01:11:57,240 --> 01:11:59,846
我没事 谢谢
I'm fine, thanks.

1076
01:12:03,920 --> 01:12:06,651
谢谢你把那个放回去 谢谢
Thank you for putting that back. Thanks.

1077
01:12:09,240 --> 01:12:11,242
我还要买点什么?
What else did I need?

1078
01:12:16,040 --> 01:12:18,168
吐得到处都是
puked all over the field.

1079
01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:20,243
你是玛姬·迪恩?
Maggie Dean?

1080
01:12:21,680 --> 01:12:23,250
我是卡莉·范德·霍夫啊
It's Carlie Van der Hoff.

1081
01:12:23,400 --> 01:12:24,481
还记得加菲尔德高中吗?
Garfield High?

1082
01:12:25,080 --> 01:12:28,209
- 记得 你好  - 天啊 你最近过得好吗?
- Yeah, hi.  - Yeah, my God! How are you?

1083
01:12:28,520 --> 01:12:31,251
- 我没事  - 哦 他是卡伦
- I'm fine.  - Oh, this is Cullen.

1084
01:12:31,840 --> 01:12:33,046
- 卡伦 打个招呼  - 嗨
- Say hi, Cullen.  - Hi.

1085
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:35,728
他是我最大的孩子
He's the oldest of my rug rats.

1086
01:12:36,120 --> 01:12:37,770
看看你
Yeah, but look at you.

1087
01:12:38,280 --> 01:12:39,611
你是来看家人的吗?
Are you visiting family?

1088
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:41,205
不 我就住这里
No, no, I live here.

1089
01:12:41,760 --> 01:12:42,760
- 真的?  - 是啊
- Really?  - Yeah.

1090
01:12:42,800 --> 01:12:45,371
真奇怪 我们从来没碰见过呢
That's so weird that we've never run into each other.

1091
01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:47,920
- 是啊  - 我在学校雇员工会里
- Yeah.  - I'm at the school employees credit union.

1092
01:12:48,000 --> 01:12:49,445
- 妈妈  - 卡伦 嘘
- Mom.  - Cullen, hush.

1093
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:50,886
如果你无聊的话 去车里等着
If you're bored, go wait in the car.

1094
01:12:50,960 --> 01:12:52,485
- 哦 我要打算走了  - 去吧
- Oh, I'm gonna be leaving.  - Beat it.

1095
01:12:52,840 --> 01:12:55,446
- 去你的!  - 嘿 你小心点!
- Kiss my ass!  - Hey, you watch it, mister!

1096
01:12:56,320 --> 01:12:57,401
回敬你!
Back at ya!

1097
01:13:00,280 --> 01:13:01,611
真是个小杂种
What a little shit.

1098
01:13:02,040 --> 01:13:04,520
你相信吗? 现在的小孩都是这样 太不听话了
Can you believe kids today? The attitudes.

1099
01:13:05,400 --> 01:13:07,209
- 你有孩子吗?  - 没有
- Do you have kids?  - No.

1100
01:13:07,800 --> 01:13:11,282
那你很幸运 因为他们都是调皮蛋
Well, you're lucky because they are little shits.

1101
01:13:13,520 --> 01:13:16,171
你最近怎么样了? 还有麦洛呢?
So, how are you? How's Milo?

1102

都跟我说说
Tell me everything.

1103
01:13:18,800 --> 01:13:20,245

1106
01:13:30,920 --> 01:13:31,967
哦 天啊
Oh, boy.

1107
01:13:32,480 --> 01:13:33,925
你没事吧?
Are you okay?

1108
01:13:36,280 --> 01:13:38,647
卡莉 你能不能... 能不能等一下?
Carlie, can you... Can you give me one second?

1109
01:13:38,960 --> 01:13:40,007
- 可以  - 我马上回来
- Yeah.  - Be right back.

1110
01:13:44,320 --> 01:13:47,529
谢谢 谢谢 哦 谢...
Thank you, thank you. Oh, thank...

1111
01:14:04,600 --> 01:14:05,840
我们之间结束了
It's over.

1112
01:14:09,040 --> 01:14:11,725
别 这次是真的
No, for real.

1113
01:14:19,160 --> 01:14:20,161
嗨
Hi.

1114
01:14:21,720 --> 01:14:24,246
亲爱的 怎么了?
Honey, what's going on here?

1115
01:14:28,840 --> 01:14:30,365
那些都是以前的了
Those are old.

1116
01:14:31,640 --> 01:14:37,283
好吧 处方单上说这些是上个月的 所以...
Okay, well, the prescription says that they're from last month, so...

1117
01:14:46,320 --> 01:14:48,402
亲爱的 对不起 我...
Honey, I'm sorry that...

1118
01:15:00,240 --> 01:15:01,844
听着...
Listen...

1119
01:15:03,760 --> 01:15:06,604
如果你现在还不想要孩子
If you don't want to have kids right now,

1120
01:15:07,520 --> 01:15:10,126
我们可以谈一下这个问题 好吗?
we can talk about that, okay?

1121
01:15:13,040 --> 01:15:15,168
你不需要对我撒谎
You don't need to lie to me.

1122
01:15:21,400 --> 01:15:24,802
亲爱的 你现在让我有点慌了
Sweetie, you're freaking me out right now.

1123
01:15:28,280 --> 01:15:30,487
我是个烂人 兰斯
I'm a sick person, Lance.

1124
01:15:32,280 --> 01:15:33,964
什么意思?
What do you mean?

1125
01:15:39,040 --> 01:15:42,965
自从我们结婚我就一直有外遇
I've been with other men since we've been married.

1126
01:15:45,880 --> 01:15:47,211
有过三个
Three.

1127
01:15:49,440 --> 01:15:51,283
三个男人
Three other men.

1128
01:15:53,120 --> 01:15:56,966
我不爱他们 我知道那不重要
I wasn't in love with any of them. I know that doesn't matter.

1129
01:16:00,480 --> 01:16:02,323
对不起
I'm so sorry.

1130
01:16:09,720 --> 01:16:11,131
对不起
I'm sorry.

1131
01:16:14,280 --> 01:16:15,486
兰斯?
Lance?

1132
01:16:39,360 --> 01:16:41,488
他很困惑 我很同情他
Look, he was confused. I felt terrible for him.

1133
01:16:41,560 --> 01:16:43,289
- 嘿!  - 你没有权利干涉我的生活!
- Hey!  - You had no right!

1134
01:16:43,360 --> 01:16:44,691
事情总是要败露的
Things were gonna crash down eventually.

1135
01:16:44,760 --> 01:16:46,125
不 你只是想报复我
No, you were just trying to get back at me.

1136
01:16:46,200 --> 01:16:48,931
- 我想帮你  - 你毁了我的婚姻
- I was trying to help you.  - You just ruined my marriage.

1137
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:50,849
- 什么婚姻?  - 混蛋
- What marriage?  - Fuck you.

1138
01:16:51,600 --> 01:16:52,806
听着 你很痛苦
Look, you're miserable,

1139
01:16:52,920 --> 01:16:55,161
如果你不敢做出什么改变 我来帮你
and if you're too chicken shit to do anything about it, then I will.

1140
01:16:55,240 --> 01:16:56,730
哦 所以说 你知道怎么样对我好?
Oh, so, you know what's best for me?

1141
01:16:56,840 --> 01:16:58,649
是的 你是我姐姐 我们应该互相帮助才对
Yes, you're my sister. We're supposed to help each other out.

1142
01:16:58,720 --> 01:17:00,165
- 这是你自己说的  - 这不一样!
- You said that.  - This is different!

1143
01:17:00,240 --> 01:17:02,561
- 怎么不一样?  - 我们都是成年人了 这是我的婚姻
- How?  - We are adults. This is my marriage.

1144
01:17:02,680 --> 01:17:05,160
如果你觉得那还是像样的婚姻的话 那你他妈的就是疯了
If you think that's a marriage, then you're fucking nuts, okay?

1145
01:17:05,200 --> 01:17:08,124
- 对不起 继续享受你的婚姻吧  - 好啊 走啊 你走吧
- I'm sorry. Enjoy your marital bliss.  - Okay, yeah, go. Leave anyway.

1146
01:17:08,200 --> 01:17:09,361
这根本行不通
This is not working out.

1147
01:17:10,120 --> 01:17:12,691
你知道什么事情很悲伤吗? 我们是好队友
You know what the sad thing is? Is that we're a good team.

1148
01:17:12,760 --> 01:17:15,604
是啊 要不是你的生活那么一团糟 有你在身边也很不错的
Oh, yeah, and you'd be a real hoot to have around if you weren't such a fuckup.

1149
01:17:15,800 --> 01:17:17,325
我们的生活都是一团糟 不是吗?
We're both fuckups, okay?

1150
01:17:17,400 --> 01:17:19,482
我不想再装作你还是我们两个中没问题的那个
And I'm tired of you acting like you're the healthy one

1151
01:17:19,560 --> 01:17:20,971
而我是那个需要帮助的人
and I'm your special needs kid.

1152
01:17:21,040 --> 01:17:23,008
这还有什么关系 麦洛?
What does it even matter anymore, Milo?

1153
01:17:23,080 --> 01:17:24,650
你复仇成功了 你成功了
You got your revenge. You got it.

1154
01:17:24,720 --> 01:17:25,801
我只是想坦诚一点
I was trying to lay it out on the table.

1155
01:17:25,880 --> 01:17:26,881
我只是这么想的
That's what I was trying to do.

1156
01:17:27,000 --> 01:17:28,081
- 你想要坦诚相待?  - 是的!
- You wanna lay it out on the table?  - Yes!

1157
01:17:28,160 --> 01:17:29,650
好啊 那来吧
Okay, then, go for it.

1158
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:31,842
- 你情绪不稳定  - 你是个傻瓜
- You're emotionally unstable.  - You're a prick.

1159
01:17:31,920 --> 01:17:33,524
你需要看心理医生
You need professional help.

1160
01:17:33,600 --> 01:17:36,080
这句话还是从一个刚刚想自杀的人口里说出来的
And this coming from a guy who just tried to kill himself.

1161
01:17:36,560 --> 01:17:38,642
也许我遇到问题就去找个人操吧
Maybe I should try fucking all my problems away.

1162
01:17:39,400 --> 01:17:41,767
也许下次你得切深一点
Well, maybe next time you should cut deeper.

1163
01:18:10,600 --> 01:18:13,809
哦不 不要啊 不要啊
Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no, no.

1164
01:18:13,880 --> 01:18:15,484
卧槽
Shit.

1165
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:18,161
我靠
Fuck.

1166
01:18:20,720 --> 01:18:22,927
别死啊 卧槽
Come on. Fuck.

1167
01:18:24,600 --> 01:18:26,807
活过来 快活过来
Come on, come on, come on.

1168
01:18:27,400 --> 01:18:28,890
对了 就这样
There we go. There we go.

1169
01:18:30,360 --> 01:18:32,010
对了 对了 给你
Yeah, yeah, yeah. There you go.

1170
01:18:32,320 --> 01:18:33,970
活过来!
Come on!

1171
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:36,966
活过来!
Come on!

1172
01:18:57,320 --> 01:19:00,210
嘿 我知道我不该过来
Hey, I know I'm not supposed to come over here or anything,

1173
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:04,609
但我想和你谈谈 这是你欠我的
but I want to talk to you, and I think you owe me that.

1174
01:19:06,280 --> 01:19:08,442
你欠我的 我就是这么想的
You owe me. That's what I think.

1175
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:33,770
听着 我肯定你的姐姐不是有意那样说的
Listen, I'm sure your sister didn't mean what she said.

1176
01:19:36,160 --> 01:19:38,208
你怎么做到的?
So, how do you make this work?

1177
01:19:38,280 --> 01:19:42,604
你怎么搞定你女朋友 你儿子和我的?
Like, how do you juggle a girlfriend and a son with guys like me?

1178
01:19:43,240 --> 01:19:45,163
有很多像你一样的人
Well, there aren't a lot of guys like you.

1179
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:47,961
谢谢 老师
Thanks, Teach.

1180
01:19:48,040 --> 01:19:50,611
不... 我是说 这不是很常见
No, not... I mean, it's not a pattern.

1181
01:19:51,120 --> 01:19:52,531
你是同性恋吗?
Are you gay?

1182
01:20:01,560 --> 01:20:05,884
我可以和梅琳达过日子 我也想这么做
I can make it work with Melinda, and I really want to.

1183
01:20:08,240 --> 01:20:09,844
那祝你好运
Well, good luck with that.

1184
01:20:16,120 --> 01:20:19,442
别... 你能不能... 你他妈的在干什么啊?
Don't... Can you... What are you fucking doing, man?

1185
01:20:19,520 --> 01:20:20,800
我不是为了这个过来的
That's not why I came over here.

1186
01:20:21,160 --> 01:20:23,686
- 麦洛...  - 我是谁啊? 禁果?
- Milo...  - What am I, some sort of forbidden fruit?

1187
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:25,205
- 不是  - 或者说...
- No.  - Or, like, some sort of...

1188
01:20:25,280 --> 01:20:28,489
我对你来说是个充气娃娃? 你到底把我当什么?
What am I, like, a blow-up doll? What am I to you?

1189
01:20:32,080 --> 01:20:35,368
我对你很不好 我知道 但...
I treated you terribly. I know that. But...

1190
01:20:37,800 --> 01:20:40,690
这不是因为我不在乎或者...
It's not because I don't care or because...

1191
01:20:42,800 --> 01:20:44,529
或者我不尊重你...
I don't respect you...

1192
01:20:45,920 --> 01:20:48,287
或者我不爱你
or because I don't love you.

1193
01:20:51,640 --> 01:20:54,530
只是因为我是个胆小鬼 仅此而已
It's because I'm a big pussy. That's it.

1194
01:20:55,000 --> 01:20:58,447
我是个可悲的胆小鬼
I'm just a huge, pathetic pussy.

1195
01:21:03,840 --> 01:21:05,604
我永远不能像你一样
I could never be you.

1196
01:21:12,440 --> 01:21:15,205
如果你想的话 你可以睡沙发上
You can crash on the couch, if you want.

1197
01:21:24,080 --> 01:21:26,082
你读过我的剧本吗?
Did you, by chance, read my script?

1198
01:21:28,120 --> 01:21:29,406
读过
Yeah.

1199
01:21:29,800 --> 01:21:31,086
怎么样?
And?

1200
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:33,366
很棒
It's great.

1201
01:21:34,000 --> 01:21:36,571
我会把它拿给我的经纪人的
I'll definitely give it to my agent.

1202
01:22:47,720 --> 01:22:51,805
再说一遍 528号公交从奈亚克出发前往港务局公交车站
Once again, this is the 528 leaving Nyack for Port Authority Bus Terminal.

1203
01:22:55,480 --> 01:22:59,007
如果能收回我说过的话 我做什么都愿意
I would do anything to take back what I said.

1204
01:23:00,800 --> 01:23:03,690
不管结果怎样 我想说对不起
For what it's worth, I'm sorry.

1205
01:23:07,720 --> 01:23:09,449
我爱你
I love you.

1206
01:23:11,120 --> 01:23:12,724
我搞砸了
I screwed it up.

1207
01:23:13,600 --> 01:23:15,568
我总是这样
I do that a lot, I guess.

1208
01:23:15,920 --> 01:23:17,445
这差不多是我的爱好了
It's kind of my thing.

1209
01:23:19,240 --> 01:23:20,810
但是我懂了
But I get it.

1210
01:23:21,280 --> 01:23:22,691
爸爸他...
Dad just...

1211
01:23:23,840 --> 01:23:25,524
看到了一条出路
saw a way out.

1212
01:23:26,600 --> 01:23:28,443
我猜你也看到了吧
I guess you did, too.

1213
01:23:39,720 --> 01:23:41,961
我不再害怕了
I'm not scared anymore.

1214
01:23:44,120 --> 01:23:46,122
我终于懂了
I finally get it.

1215
01:23:47,880 --> 01:23:49,609
再会
See you later.

1216
01:25:36,960 --> 01:25:39,201
呼吸 呼吸 呼吸 你没事的
Breathe, breathe, breathe. You're okay.

1217
01:25:39,600 --> 01:25:41,045
你没事吧?
Are you okay?

1218
01:25:44,360 --> 01:25:45,441
你没事
You're okay.

1219
01:25:45,520 --> 01:25:47,409
好了 说句话 随便说一句
All right, say something. Just say something.

1220
01:25:48,480 --> 01:25:49,970
- 我没事  - 你没事
- I'm okay.  - You're okay.

1221
01:25:50,120 --> 01:25:51,929
你没事 天啊 你没事
You're okay, Jesus. You're okay.

1222
