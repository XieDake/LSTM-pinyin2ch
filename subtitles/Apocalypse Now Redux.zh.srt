5
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:17,890
西贡
Saigon.

6
00:04:19,660 --> 00:04:21,630
妈的
Shit.

7
00:04:22,790 --> 00:04:25,590
我还是在西贡
I'm still only in Saigon.

8
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:37,500
每次醒来  总以为重返森林
Every time, I think I'm gonna wake up back in thejungle.

9
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,440
我第一次回家时  情况最糟
When I was home after my first tour, it was worse.

10
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:57,690
醒来后  发觉只是噩梦一场
I'd wake up, and there'd be nothing.

11
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:07,690
我几乎没和妻子说话
I hardly said a word to my wife

12
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:10,070
直到答应离婚才说了个  是
until I said yes to a divorce.

13
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:15,510
当我在战场时  很想回家
When I was here, I wanted to be there.

14
00:05:16,110 --> 00:05:18,700
当我在家
When I was there,

15
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:21,280
又想着回到森林
all I could think of was getting backinto thejungle.

16
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:26,590
我已回来一星期了
I'm here a weeknow.

17
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:31,960
等待任务
Waiting for a mission...

18
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:34,820
意志消沉
getting softer.

19
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:43,070
我留在房间越久  只会越软弱
Every minute I stay in this room, I get weaker.

20
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,410
越共留在森林越久
And every minute Charlie squats in the bush,

21
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:47,540
就越强悍
he gets stronger.

22
00:05:52,250 --> 00:05:54,620
每次环顾四周
Each time I looked around,

23
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:56,980
墙壁似乎分秒迫近
the walls moved in a little tighter.

24
00:07:35,890 --> 00:07:38,750
每个人都有愿望
Everyone gets everything he wants.

25
00:07:39,590 --> 00:07:41,790
我渴望任务
I wanted a mission...

26
00:07:42,190 --> 00:07:45,100
真是咎由自取  他们给了我一个
and for my sins, they gave me one.

27
00:07:46,200 --> 00:07:48,670
像客房服务般交给了我
Brought it up to me like room service.

28
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:51,870

这真是项艰巨的任务
It was a real choice mission.

31
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,940
当完成它后
And when it was over,

32

我绝不想再有第二个
I'd never want another.

当时却一无所知

54
00:09:32,900 --> 00:09:35,400
花数星期  逆流而上数百公里
Weeks away and hundreds of miles up a river...

55
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:38,800
在战火中迂回前行  就像一条主电缆

正如我回到西贡一样

他的故事  有一部份关于我

for murder.

150
00:15:37,140 --> 00:15:40,070
我不明白  长官  他杀了谁?
I don't follow, sir. Murdered who?

151
00:15:40,270 --> 00:15:44,330
库尔兹下令处决了  几名越南情报员
kurtz had ordered the execution of some Vietnamese intelligence agents--

152
00:15:44,540 --> 00:15:47,810
认为他们是双重间谍
men he believed were double agents.

153
00:15:48,750 --> 00:15:51,410
他独断专行
So he took matters into his own hands.

154
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:55,910
你瞧  威尔德
Well, you see, Willard...

155
00:15:56,350 --> 00:15:58,950
这场战役
in this war,

156
00:15:59,690 --> 00:16:02,180
是非难辨
things get confused out there.

157
00:16:02,660 --> 00:16:06,120
包括权力  理想  旧道德观
Power, ideals, the old morality...

158
00:16:06,330 --> 00:16:08,960
以及实际的军事需要
and practical military necessity.

159
00:16:11,140 --> 00:16:14,000
但在那和当地人一起
But out there with these natives...

160
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:18,900
被敬为神明
it must be a temptation to...

161
00:16:19,510 --> 00:16:21,210
很是诱人
be God.

162
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:27,910
因为任何人的心中  必有冲突
Because there's a conflict in every human heart...

163
00:16:28,620 --> 00:16:31,520
在理性和非理性间
between the rational and the irrational...

164
00:16:32,360 --> 00:16:34,450
善与恶间
between good and evil...

165
00:16:35,790 --> 00:16:38,730
善不一定总战胜恶
and good does not always triumph.

166
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:42,770
有时
Sometimes...

167
00:16:43,800 --> 00:16:45,770
林肯说的  善良天使
the dark side...

168
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:50,630
会被邪恶击败
overcomes what Lincoln called the better angels of our nature.

169
00:16:52,340 --> 00:16:54,810
每个人都有临界点
Every man has got a breaking point.

170
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,050
你和我也一样
You and I have them.

171
00:16:59,250 --> 00:17:01,840
库尔兹已到了他的
Walt kurtz has reached his.

172
00:17:03,190 --> 00:17:06,590
很明显  他已疯了
And very obviously, he has gone insane.

173
00:17:19,300 --> 00:17:23,030
没错  长官  显然是疯了
Yes, sir. Very much so, sir. Obviously insane.

174
00:17:27,680 --> 00:17:32,780
你的任务是乘海军巡逻艇  沿着湄南河
Your mission is to proceed up the Nung River in a navy patrol boat--

175
00:17:33,250 --> 00:17:36,380
找寻库上校的踪迹
pick up Col. kurtz's path at Nu Mung Ba...

176
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:39,420
跟着它  沿路收集情报
follow it, learn what you can along the way.

177
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:43,630
当你发现上校  用一切手段
When you fiInd the colonel, infiIltrate his team by--

178
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:45,660
渗入他的组织
whatever means available

179
00:17:45,860 --> 00:17:47,920
终结上校的指挥
and terminate the colonel's command.

180
00:17:54,170 --> 00:17:56,900
处决上校
Terminate the colonel?

181
00:17:57,810 --> 00:18:01,970
他在那里为所欲为
He's out there operating without any decent restraint...

182
00:18:02,180 --> 00:18:06,240
做出不可饶恕的
totally beyond the pale of any acceptable...

183
00:18:06,450 --> 00:18:08,110
行径
human conduct...

184
00:18:08,450 --> 00:18:11,850
而他仍握有军权
and he is still on the fiIeld, commanding troops.

185
00:18:12,690 --> 00:18:17,020
执行军纪  处决他
Terminate with extreme prejudice.

186
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:22,460
要明白  上尉  这任务从不存在
You understand, Captain, that this mission...

187
00:18:23,100 --> 00:18:25,590
也不会记录在案
does not exist nor will it ever exist.

188
00:19:20,190 --> 00:19:23,160
我杀过多少人?
How many people had I already killed?

189
00:19:24,030 --> 00:19:27,230
我能肯定的有6个
There were those six that I knew about for sure--

190
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:31,560
他们都死在我跟前
close enough to blow their last breath in my face.

191
00:19:33,470 --> 00:19:36,910
但这次我要杀同胞
But this time it was an American...

192
00:19:37,210 --> 00:19:39,110
而且是个军官
and an officer.

193
00:19:49,990 --> 00:19:52,890
对我来说  应该没什么分别
That wasn't supposed to make any difference to me...

194
00:19:53,060 --> 00:19:54,680
事实上却不好受
but it did.

195
00:19:56,830 --> 00:19:58,320
妈的
Shit.

196
00:19:58,530 --> 00:20:00,220
在战场上指控人谋杀
Charging a man with murder in this place...

197
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:04,260
就像在  印第500车上  开超速罚单
was like handing out speeding tickets at the Indy 500.

198
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:07,800
我接受了任务
I took the mission.

199
00:20:08,010 --> 00:20:10,500
我还能怎么办?
What the hell else was I gonna do?

200
00:20:12,140 --> 00:20:15,510
但我真的不知道  找到了他会怎样做
But I really didn't know what I'd do when I found him.

201
00:20:22,690 --> 00:20:25,160
你查过油箱吗?
Did you check the tank?

202
00:20:25,660 --> 00:20:27,180
是的
Yeah.

203
00:20:28,660 --> 00:20:32,120
我乘海军巡逻艇  沿着岸边而行
I was being ferried down the coast in a navy PBR...

204
00:20:32,260 --> 00:20:34,490
这是种橡皮巡逻艇
a type of plastic patrol boat--

205
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:36,720
在河上随处可见
a pretty common sight on the rivers.

206
00:20:36,930 --> 00:20:38,800
他们说用来搜集情报
They said it was a good way to pick up information and move...

207
00:20:39,000 --> 00:20:43,570
不会引人注目  这样不错
without drawing a lot of attention, and that was okay.

208
00:20:43,770 --> 00:20:46,540
反正我需要新鲜空气和时间
I needed the air and the time.

209
00:20:47,310 --> 00:20:49,180
唯一的问题是  我并非独自一人
Only problem was I wouldn't be alone.

210
00:20:49,380 --> 00:20:51,280
早安  上尉
Mornin', Captain.

211
00:20:53,550 --> 00:20:56,680
船员绝大多数是新手
The crew were mostly just kids--

212
00:20:56,890 --> 00:21:00,350
爱唱摇滚乐  不知大难临头
rockand rollers with one foot in their graves.

213
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,360
-你多大?  -17
-How old are you?  -Seventeen.

214
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:06,460
叫大厨的机械师
The machinist--the one they called Chef--

215
00:21:06,460 --> 00:21:08,060
来自新奥尔良
was from New Orleans.

216
00:21:08,270 --> 00:21:10,960
他太紧张  不该来越南
He was wrapped too tight for Vietnam.

217
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:12,860
或许去新奥尔良也如此
Probably wrapped too tight for New Orleans.

218
00:21:15,170 --> 00:21:16,870
兰斯  开50口径机枪  是洛杉矶南部海滩
Lance, on the forward fifties...

219
00:21:17,070 --> 00:21:18,700
一位著名的冲浪高手
was a famous surfer from the beaches south of L.A.

220
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:20,840
看他一眼
To look at him,

221
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,780
就知他这辈子没开过枪
you wouldn't believe he'd ever fired a weapon in his life.

222
00:21:24,680 --> 00:21:28,880
克林先生  出身纽约南布朗克斯贫民区
Clean--Mr. Clean--was from some South Bronx shit-hole...

223
00:21:29,090 --> 00:21:31,020
我想越南的阳光和环境
and I think the light and the space of Vietnam...

224
00:21:31,210 --> 00:21:33,800
的确令他清醒不少
really put the zap on his head.

225
00:21:36,410 --> 00:21:38,670
还有  酋长  菲腊
Then there was Phillips, the chief.

226
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:40,690
这也许是我的任务
It might have been my mission,

227
00:21:40,690 --> 00:21:42,510
但船却由菲腊掌控
but it sure as shit was the chief''s boat.

228
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:45,050
有两处的水深够
There's about two points where we can draw enough water...

229
00:21:45,150 --> 00:21:47,180
可进入湄南河
to get into the Nung River.

230
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:50,600
但都很危险  是越共的地盘
They're both hot. Belong to Charlie.

231
00:21:51,710 --> 00:21:53,570
别担心
Don't worry about it.

232
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:55,870
别抽烟
Don't smoke.

233
00:21:57,450 --> 00:22:00,470
我在这参加过几次特别行动
You know, I've pulled a few special ops in here.

234
00:22:00,850 --> 00:22:03,050
大约半年前
About six months ago...

235
00:22:03,450 --> 00:22:07,150
我带一个人穿过都朗桥
I took a man who was going up past the bridge at Do Lung.

236
00:22:07,860 --> 00:22:10,420
他也是正规军
He was regular army too.

237
00:22:12,530 --> 00:22:15,000
听说他已吞枪自尽
Heard he shot himself in the head.

238
00:22:23,860 --> 00:22:27,490
起初  我认为他们给错了档案
At first I thought they handed me the wrong dossier.

239
00:22:27,690 --> 00:22:30,460
真不敢相信  他们想取这人的性命
I couldn't believe they wanted this man dead.

240
00:22:32,130 --> 00:22:34,930
三代均出身西点  尖子生
Third-generation West Point, top of his class.

241
00:22:35,140 --> 00:22:39,160
韩战  空降兵  获勋章无数
korea, Airborne, about a thousand decorations.

242
00:22:39,370 --> 00:22:41,970
诸如此类的
Et cetera, et cetera.

243
00:22:44,040 --> 00:22:48,380
我听到带子上他的声音  很感兴趣
I'd heard his voice on the tape, and it really put the hookin me...

244
00:22:49,020 --> 00:22:54,080
但无法把它和这人联系起来
but I couldn't connect up that voice with this man.

245
00:22:59,860 --> 00:23:03,460
正如他们所说  他战功卓著
Like they said, he had an impressive career.

246
00:23:03,630 --> 00:23:05,890
或许太卓越了
Maybe too impressive.

247
00:23:06,570 --> 00:23:08,630
简直是完美
I mean, perfect.

248
00:23:09,100 --> 00:23:12,770
他曾被推荐出任要职
He was being groomed for one of the top slots in the corporation--

249
00:23:12,990 --> 00:23:16,930
将军  参谋长  等等
general, chief of staff, anything.

250
00:23:18,130 --> 00:23:20,120
1964年
In 1 664,

251
00:23:20,120 --> 00:23:22,120
他陪顾问官巡视越南后回国
he returned from a tour with Advisory Command in Vietnam...

252
00:23:22,330 --> 00:23:24,490
似乎开始走下坡
and things started to slip.

253
00:23:24,770 --> 00:23:26,850
他交给参谋长联席会议
His report to the Joint Chiefs of Staff

254
00:23:27,250 --> 00:23:29,730
及约翰逊总统的报告被压
and Lyndon Johnson was restricted.

255
00:23:31,310 --> 00:23:33,280
他们似乎并不欣赏他的见解
Seems they didn't dig what he had to tell them.

256
00:23:34,880 --> 00:23:37,850
此后的几个月  他3次申请
During the next few months, he made three requests for transfer...

257
00:23:38,120 --> 00:23:40,900
转住佐治压州班宁堡接受空降训练
to Airborne training, Fort Benning, Georgia,

258
00:23:40,900 --> 00:23:43,680
最终获批
and was finally accepted.

259
00:23:45,890 --> 00:23:47,750
空降兵?
Airborne?

260
00:23:50,090 --> 00:23:52,720
当时他已38岁
He was 38 years old.

261
00:23:53,860 --> 00:23:56,420
他究竟打的什么主意?
Why the fuck would he do that?

262
00:23:58,520 --> 00:24:02,720
1966年  加入特种部队
1966, joins Special Forces...

263
00:24:02,920 --> 00:24:04,950
重回越南
returns to Vietnam.

264
00:24:06,010 --> 00:24:07,030
那是什么?
Hey, what's that?

265
00:24:07,240 --> 00:24:09,580
-弧光行动  -怎么了?
-Arc light.  -What's up?

266
00:24:09,780 --> 00:24:12,720
-B-52轰炸  -什么?
-B-52 strike.  -Yeah?

267
00:24:12,950 --> 00:24:14,140
-那是什么?  -弧光
-What's that?  -Arc light.

268
00:24:14,350 --> 00:24:15,850
真讨厌  每次听到
I hate that. Every time I hear that,

269
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:17,340
都没好事
something terrible happens.

270
00:24:17,550 --> 00:24:19,390
越共一点也不在乎
Charlie don't never see 'em or hear 'em, man.

271
00:24:19,590 --> 00:24:20,560
又来了
There they are.

272
00:24:20,760 --> 00:24:23,230
冲击力让人呼吸困难
Concussion will suck the air out of your damn lungs.

273
00:24:23,660 --> 00:24:25,290
有可怕的事要发生
Something terrible is gonna happen.

274
00:24:25,500 --> 00:24:26,830
有烟!
Smoke!

275
00:24:27,030 --> 00:24:29,090
是二次燃烧
Secondary burning.

276
00:24:29,300 --> 00:24:30,990
是休伊直升机  有很多架
Hueys over there. Lots of Hueys.

277
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,330
去看看  酋长
Let's have a look, Chief.

278
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,670
是空中骑兵  九团一队
It was the Air-Cav. First of the Ninth

279
00:24:37,670 --> 00:24:39,500
是他们
That's them.

280
00:24:39,610 --> 00:24:42,200
负责护送我们到湄南河口
our escorts to the mouth of the Nung River.

281
00:24:42,480 --> 00:24:44,400
但他们应该
But they were supposed to be waiting for us

282
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:46,310
在前方30公里处等啊
another 30 kilometers ahead.

283
00:24:46,450 --> 00:24:51,480
空中机动部队  就是没法安生
Well, Air Mobile. Those boys just couldn't stay put.

284
00:25:03,270 --> 00:25:07,130
快点  下来
Hey, kid, come on. Get down. Come on.

285
00:25:17,950 --> 00:25:20,080
九团一队  以前是支骑兵部队
First of the Ninth was an old cavalry division...

286
00:25:20,280 --> 00:25:22,080
卖了马  换成直升机
that had cashed in its horses for choppers...

287
00:25:22,290 --> 00:25:25,950
专在湄南河一带搜敌
and gone tear-assing around 'Nam looking for the shit.

288
00:25:26,290 --> 00:25:30,230
好几次令越共措手不及
They'd given Charlie a few surprises in their time here.

289
00:25:31,030 --> 00:25:32,190
他们这次突袭
What they were mopping up now

290
00:25:32,400 --> 00:25:35,300
一小时前毫无征兆
hadn't even happened yet an hour ago.

291
00:25:36,230 --> 00:25:37,930
继续跑  我们在拍电视
Just keeping running by. We're for television.

292
00:25:38,100 --> 00:25:40,630
别看镜头  继续  快走
Don't look at the camera. Just keep--Go on. keep going.

293
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:43,360
在拍电视  别看镜头
This is for television. Don't look at the camera.

294
00:25:43,570 --> 00:25:46,060
作战斗状  前进
Just go by like you're fiIghting, like you're fiIghting.

295
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:48,070
别看镜头  在拍电视
Don't look at the camera. It's for television.Just go through.

296
00:25:48,280 --> 00:25:51,870
快走! 前进
Just go by. keep on going.

297

377

没有  来后没冲过浪

378

以主耶稣基督  带来善行

愿你的名被尊为圣(《马太福音》6:9)

基尔戈今天很愉快

他们享受牛扒  啤酒
They choppered in the T-bones and the beer...

394
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:34,090
将基地变成沙滩派对
and turned the LZ into a beach party.

395
00:31:34,750 --> 00:31:37,420
他们越想营造家的感觉
The more they tried to make it just like home...

396
00:31:37,620 --> 00:31:40,020
便越怀念家
the more they made everybody miss it.

397
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:44,320
我要半生的  不是要冻肉
Make my meat rare--rare but not cold.

398

我猜他不是个差劲的军官

他爱下属  和他在一起有安全感

他有特殊的魅力

但在战场上  他会爱惜身体

405
00:32:18,870 --> 00:32:20,330
长官
Sir,

406

我们可经两处进入河道

407
00:32:22,540 --> 00:32:25,230
-没错  -这两处

408
00:32:25,440 --> 00:32:27,490
虽然三角洲很宽阔
It's a pretty wide delta,

409
00:32:27,490 --> 00:32:29,530
但只有这两处我肯定可进入
but these are the only two spots I'm sure of.

410
00:32:30,580 --> 00:32:33,550
你指的这个村庄不敢领教  威尔德
That village you're pointing at is kind of hairy.

411
00:32:33,750 --> 00:32:36,080

有重型武器驻守
Got some pretty heavy ordnance.

413
00:32:37,980 --> 00:32:40,780
我不时在那丢几艘侦察艇
I lost a few recon ships in there now and again.

414
00:32:40,990 --> 00:32:42,420
那该死的村子叫什么?
What's the name of that goddamn village?

415
00:32:42,620 --> 00:32:46,110
云东道或云东里
Vin Drin Dop.  Dop or Lop?

416
00:32:46,330 --> 00:32:49,300
越南鬼起的名字都差不多
Damn gook names all sound the same.

417
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:53,560
迈克  你了解云东道的这里吗?
Mike, you know anything about this point at Vin Drin Dop?

418
00:32:53,830 --> 00:32:55,200
浪头没得说
That's a fantastic peak.

419
00:32:56,040 --> 00:32:57,940
-浪头?  -近2米高的浪
-Peak?  -About six foot.

420
00:32:58,140 --> 00:33:01,800
很少见  左右滑面也很长
It's an outstanding peak. It's got both the long right and left slide...

421
00:33:02,010 --> 00:33:05,240
浪形前所未见  是冲浪胜地
with a bowl section that's unbelievable.It's just tube city.

422
00:33:09,480 --> 00:33:11,350
为什么不早说?  好浪头
Why didn't you tell me that before? A good peak.

423
00:33:11,550 --> 00:33:14,110
这鬼地方  没见过好浪头
There aren't any good peaks in this whole shitty country.

424
00:33:14,420 --> 00:33:16,980
-只有碎浪  -但那真的很危险
-It's all goddamn beach break.  -It's really hairy in there.

425
00:33:17,090 --> 00:33:18,420
麦克唐纳就死在那
That's where we lost McDonald.

426
00:33:18,620 --> 00:33:22,530
我们受了重创  那是越共的据点
They shot the hell out of us there. That's Charlie's point.

427
00:33:23,830 --> 00:33:26,320
长官  我们可在明天黎明出发

早晨常有离岸的微风
There's always a good offshore breeze in the morning.

429

船可能开不进
We may not be able to get the boat in.

430
00:33:31,070 --> 00:33:33,730
河口恐怕吃水太浅
The draft at the mouth of that river may be too shallow.

431
00:33:34,540 --> 00:33:35,990
我们可吊起船
We'll pick your boat up

432
00:33:35,990 --> 00:33:37,440
放在你希望的地方
and put it down like a baby where you want it.

433

去别处冲浪吧

我喜欢凝固汽油弹  在清晨的味道

00:49:20,530 --> 00:49:23,400
有一次  我们连续12小时炸一座山头
You know, one time we had a hill bombed for 1 2 hours.

612
00:49:23,600 --> 00:49:25,900
炸完后  我爬上山
When it was all over, I walked up.

613
00:49:26,770 --> 00:49:30,440
一具越共的腐臭尸体  也没发现

It's gonna blow this place out.

I'm really sorry, Colonel. I'm afraid that does it.

626
00:50:23,010 --> 00:50:24,310
他名气大
The kid's got a reputation.

627
00:50:24,510 --> 00:50:26,640
别指望他在泥水里冲浪
You can't expect him to surf those sloppy waves.

628
00:50:26,850 --> 00:50:29,220
-我懂  -我是个艺术家  基尔戈

不能在泥水里冲浪

瞧  兰斯  我道歉  但不是我的错

海浪被凝固汽油弹吹散
The waves are gettin' blown out by the napalm.

632

那是上校的冲浪板!
That's the colonel's surfboard!

-兰斯  -大厨  点一只

00:52:14,300 --> 00:52:16,200
-抽烟吗?  -来吧  点一支
-Wanna smoke?  -Let's do it, man. Light up.

655
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:18,700
这仗终有一天会结束
Someday this war's gonna end.

656
00:52:19,800 --> 00:52:22,570
对船上的小子们是好事
That would bejust fine with the boys on the boat.

657
00:52:22,810 --> 00:52:25,300
他们只想回家
They weren't looking for anything more than a way home.

658
00:52:25,410 --> 00:52:30,070
-上尉?  -问题是  我回来了
-Captain?  -Trouble is, I'd been back there...

659
00:52:30,310 --> 00:52:32,940
执行不记录在案的任务
and I knew that it just didn't exist anymore.

660
00:52:36,820 --> 00:52:38,650
好正点!
Buddha time. Here.

661
00:52:39,320 --> 00:52:42,760
好啊  真不错  混蛋
All right, that's great, you motherfuckers. Yeah.

662
00:52:47,750 --> 00:52:50,150
若基尔戈这样打仗
If that's how kilgore fought the war...

663
00:52:50,320 --> 00:52:54,250
我开始奇怪他们究竟  和库尔兹有什么不同
I began to wonder what they really had against kurtz.

664
00:52:54,450 --> 00:52:57,150
不仅仅是发疯和谋杀
It wasn't just insanity and murder.

665
00:52:57,360 --> 00:53:00,050
这里所有人都如此
There was enough of that to go around for everyone.

666
00:53:11,270 --> 00:53:13,260
他从不为婊子伤心
I mean, he never was hurtin' for pussy.

667
00:53:14,740 --> 00:53:19,540
我不在这  我正在林中摘芒果
I'm not here. I'm walking through the jungle gathering mangos.

668

她也涂了一身
She's into mangos too.

672
00:53:36,680 --> 00:53:39,050
她爬到我身上
She's like one limb above me.

673
00:53:39,580 --> 00:53:42,610
-我们俩赤裸裸躺在林中  -嗨  酋长
-We're both in the jungle here nude. -Hey, Chief.

674
00:53:42,750 --> 00:53:45,850
-什么?  -那个上校又来了
-Yeah?  -Here comes that colonel guy again.

675
00:53:47,990 --> 00:53:51,260
找到块中意的冲浪板很难
You know how hard it is to find a board you like.

676
00:53:51,460 --> 00:53:53,790

678
00:53:57,230 --> 00:54:00,000
只要把冲浪板还我  兰斯

这是块好板  我喜欢
It was a good board, and I like it.

680
00:54:03,160 --> 00:54:05,850
找到块中意的冲浪板很难
You know how hard it is to find a board you like.

681
00:54:06,160 --> 00:54:07,450

He's a determined motherfucker!

682
00:54:07,690 --> 00:54:09,220
我不会伤害你们
I will not hurt or harm you.

683
00:54:10,230 --> 00:54:12,600
我不会伤害你们
I will not hurt or harm you.

684
00:54:12,800 --> 00:54:15,630
只要把冲浪板还我  兰斯
Just give me back the board, Lance.

685
00:54:15,820 --> 00:54:18,080
这是块好板  我喜欢
It was a good board, and I like it.

686
00:54:18,590 --> 00:54:21,460
找到块中意的冲浪板很难
You know how hard it is to find a board you like.

687
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:26,130
-我不会伤害你们  -天哪
-I will not hurt or harm you. -Jesus Christ.

688
00:54:26,560 --> 00:54:28,330
这人真他妈烦
That guy's too fuckin' much, man.

689
00:54:28,570 --> 00:54:30,730
他会射我们吗?
Do you think he would have shot us?

690
00:54:31,430 --> 00:54:33,060
他不会在海滩上下手
He wouldn't have shot us on the beach...

691
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:35,570
但要是看见我拿着他的冲浪板  就会动手的
but he would have shot us if he saw me taking his board.

692
00:54:35,810 --> 00:54:38,500
我们去冲浪吧  大家都学会了
Let's go surfin'now Everybody's learnin'how

693
00:54:38,680 --> 00:54:42,240

-Let's get this board out of my turret.  -Sucker.

694
00:54:42,450 --> 00:54:44,880
下次他再来  我就射他  如何?
How am I going to shoot him the next time he comes around?

695
00:54:45,080 --> 00:54:47,780
大厨  给冲浪板腾块地方
Hey, Chef, make some room back there for the board.

696
00:54:51,220 --> 00:54:52,920
狠狠打我呀  兰斯
Sock it to me, Lance.

697
00:54:58,630 --> 00:55:00,190
不知道是不是同一架直升机
I wonder if that's the same chopper.

698
00:55:00,400 --> 00:55:03,460
他可能让人带着录音  遍布河上
He's probably got them all over the river with that recording.

699
00:55:03,670 --> 00:55:05,630
我们要等到天黑  酋长
We'll have to hold up here till dark, Chief.

700
00:55:05,840 --> 00:55:07,890
别担心  兰斯  他不会跟太远
Don't worry, Lance. He won't follow us too far.

701
00:55:08,100 --> 00:55:09,400
为什么这么说?
What makes you say that?

702
00:55:09,610 --> 00:55:12,100
你以为上校会让上游的人都知道
You think that big Cav colonel wants everyone upriver...

703
00:55:12,310 --> 00:55:15,040
-我们偷了他的冲浪板?  -我没偷
－to know we stole his board?  －I didn't steal it!

704
00:55:17,710 --> 00:55:19,380
上尉
Captain?

705
00:55:19,620 --> 00:55:21,950
还要航行多远?
Just how far up this river we goin'?

706
00:55:22,890 --> 00:55:25,180
是机密  酋长  不能告诉你
It's classifiIed, Chief. I can't tell ya.

707
00:55:27,760 --> 00:55:29,380
我们还远着呢
We're goin' up pretty far.

708
00:55:31,830 --> 00:55:33,960
会有危险吗?
Is it gonna be hairy?

709
00:55:34,760 --> 00:55:36,460
我不知道
I don't know, kid.

710
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:38,900
也许吧
Yeah, probably.

711
00:55:39,170 --> 00:55:42,870
你喜欢深入虎穴吧  上尉?
You like it like that, Captain, when it's hot, hairy?

712
00:55:43,010 --> 00:55:44,410
妈的
Fuck.

713
00:55:54,750 --> 00:55:56,480
没机会知道
Maybe you'll get a chance to know

714
00:55:56,480 --> 00:55:58,210
你在俄亥俄的工厂里是干嘛的
what the fuck you are in some factory in Ohio.

715
00:56:01,720 --> 00:56:04,390
酋长  我想上岸摘芒果  行吗?
Hey, Chief, I'm gonna go get those mangos now, okay?

716
00:56:04,540 --> 00:56:06,640
-找个人陪你  -我会带着他

我会跟他去
I'll go with him.

718
00:56:13,890 --> 00:56:15,440
大厨?
Chef?

719
00:56:15,960 --> 00:56:18,480
-什么  长官?  -他们为什么这样叫你?
-Yes, sir?  -How come they call you that?

720
00:56:18,690 --> 00:56:21,350
-叫我什么  长官?  -大厨
-Call me what, sir?  -Chef.

721
00:56:21,560 --> 00:56:23,500

Because you like mangos and stuff?

722
00:56:23,500 --> 00:56:25,430
不  长官  我真是大厨
No, sir, I'm a real chef.

723
00:56:26,170 --> 00:56:29,530
-我是个  酱汁师    -酱汁师?
-I'm a saucier.  -Saucier?

724
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:31,870
没错  长官
Yes, sir. See,

725
00:56:32,070 --> 00:56:33,800
瞧  我来自新奥尔良
I come from New Orleans.

726
00:56:34,010 --> 00:56:38,410
自小就被培养  要做个伟大的酱汁师
I was raised to be a saucier, a great saucier.

727
00:56:38,610 --> 00:56:42,270
-什么是酱汁师?  -我们专攻酱汁
-What's a saucier?  -You specialize in sauces.

728
00:56:45,890 --> 00:56:48,790
附近一定有芒果树
Gotta be a mango tree here somewhere.

729
00:56:55,090 --> 00:56:57,720
我本来应去巴黎
Then, I was supposed to go to Paris...

730
00:56:57,960 --> 00:57:00,330
入读厨艺学校
study at the EscoffiIer school.

731
00:57:00,830 --> 00:57:04,000
却接到体检通知单
But then I got orders for my physical.

732
00:57:16,930 --> 00:57:18,520
我加入海军
Hell, I joined the navy.

733
00:57:18,800 --> 00:57:20,920
听说吃得较好
Heard they had better food.

734
00:57:21,500 --> 00:57:23,730
还有厨子学校
Cook school--that did it.

735
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:27,840
-怎么样?  -你不想听的
-Yeah, how's that?  -You don't wanna hear about that.

736
00:57:30,540 --> 00:57:34,540
近百米的上等肉排列在面前
They lined us up in front of a hundred yards of prime rib.

737
00:57:34,810 --> 00:57:38,010
所有人列队看着
All of us, you know, lined up lookin' at it.

738
00:57:38,150 --> 00:57:41,920
肉质极佳  切割很好
MagnifiIcent meat. Really! Beautifully marbled.

739
00:57:45,020 --> 00:57:48,620
接着  他们把肉扔进大锅
Next thing, they're throwing the meat into these big cauldrons--

740
00:57:48,830 --> 00:57:51,160
一锅熟
all of it--boiling it!

741
00:57:52,130 --> 00:57:55,100
我看着肉色变灰
I looked inside, man. It was turning gray.

742
00:57:56,270 --> 00:57:58,700
真他妈不敢相信
I couldn't fucking believe that one.

743
00:57:58,900 --> 00:58:00,630
于是我申请入无线电技师学校
That's when I applied for radioman school,

744
00:58:00,630 --> 00:58:02,360
他们却给了我
but then they gave me--

745
00:58:44,280 --> 00:58:45,810
那是什么?
What is it?

746
00:58:47,470 --> 00:58:49,270
越共?
Charlie?

747
00:59:02,920 --> 00:59:04,530
是老虎!  狗娘养的!
It's a tiger!Son of a bitch!

748
00:59:04,530 --> 00:59:06,150
老虎! 是老虎!
It's a tiger, man! It's a tiger!

749
00:59:07,860 --> 00:59:09,020
各就各位  兰斯  准备
Battle stations. Lance, up front.

750
00:59:09,260 --> 00:59:10,990
-M60机枪戒备  克林  -收到
-Get on your 60!  -Got it.

751
00:59:11,230 --> 00:59:14,090
天呀! 大厨  快走!
Holy shit! Chef, come on!

752
00:59:14,700 --> 00:59:15,590
他妈的老虎!
A fuckin' tiger!

753
00:59:15,800 --> 00:59:17,890
上尉  快来!
Captain, come on!

754
00:59:18,100 --> 00:59:21,330
快走!
Let's go!

755
00:59:21,540 --> 00:59:23,270
队长  你说得对! 永不要下船
You were right. Never get out of the boat.

756
00:59:23,470 --> 00:59:25,370
克林  开动M60机枪?
Bring that 60 forward!

757
00:59:25,570 --> 00:59:28,240
永不要下船! 我要记住!
I gotta remember! Never get out of the boat!

758
00:59:28,440 --> 00:59:32,280
永不要下船!
Never get out of the boat!

759
00:59:34,520 --> 00:59:37,380
出什么事了?  有多少人?
What happen? How many is it?

760
00:59:38,250 --> 00:59:40,190
-他妈的老虎!  -老虎?
-A fuckin' tiger!  -What? A tiger?

761
00:59:40,390 --> 00:59:41,980
我受够了!
Yes! I've had it!

762
00:59:42,190 --> 00:59:45,350
我是无胆鬼
I've had the whole goddamn fuckin' shit, man!

763
00:59:45,890 --> 00:59:50,130
我想回家
You can kiss my ass on the county square...

764
00:59:50,470 --> 00:59:52,190
我不想留下来
because I'm fuckin' buggin' out.

765
00:59:52,400 --> 00:59:58,640
我加入海军  不是为了送死
I don't fuckin' need it! I don't want it.

766
00:59:59,710 --> 01:00:01,870
我只想做厨师
All I wanted to do was fuckin' cook!

767
01:00:02,080 --> 01:00:05,100
我只想学烹饪
I just wanted to learn to fuckin' cook, man!

768
01:00:05,310 --> 01:00:08,370
没事了
You're all right.

769
01:00:12,650 --> 01:00:16,750
没事了  没事了
You're all right. You're gonna be all right.

770
01:00:16,990 --> 01:00:19,980
不要下船  永不下船
Never get out of the fuckin' boat.

771
01:00:20,230 --> 01:00:23,660
再见  老虎!
Hi, tiger! Bye, tiger! Good-bye!

772
01:00:25,470 --> 01:00:27,660
永不下船
Never get out of the boat.

773
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:30,660
真是至理名言
Absolutely, goddamn right...

774
01:00:31,710 --> 01:00:34,640
除非你不打算回头
unless you were going all the way.

775
01:00:39,310 --> 01:00:41,250
古华特下了船
kurtz got off the boat.

776
01:00:42,880 --> 01:00:45,650
他离经叛道
He split from the whole fuckin'program.

777
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:50,750
为什么会这样?
How did that happen?

778
01:00:51,290 --> 01:00:54,020
他第一次来时  遇见什么?
What did he see here that first tour?

779
01:01:00,600 --> 01:01:03,730
那时他已38岁
Thirty-eight fucking years old.

780
01:01:04,210 --> 01:01:05,600
若加入特种部队
If you joined the Green Berets...

781
01:01:05,810 --> 01:01:08,800
晋升至上校已是极限
there was no way you'd ever get above colonel.

782
01:01:09,380 --> 01:01:11,940
古华特知道他要放弃什么
kurtz knew what he was giving up.

783
01:01:13,420 --> 01:01:16,180
我对他认识越多
The more I read and began to understand...

784
01:01:16,380 --> 01:01:17,980
越发敬佩他
the more I admired him.

785
01:01:19,090 --> 01:01:21,390
他的家人  朋友  也不了解他
His family and friends couldn't understand it...

786
01:01:21,590 --> 01:01:23,560
他们无法说服他
and they couldn't talk him out of it.

787
01:01:25,730 --> 01:01:27,410
他申请了三次
He had to apply three times,

788
01:01:27,410 --> 01:01:29,090
承受折磨
and he put up with a ton of shit.

789
01:01:29,300 --> 01:01:32,960
当他以辞职要胁  他们屈服了
But when he threatened to resign, they gave it to him.

790
01:01:36,500 --> 01:01:40,370
班上的后生仔  比他年轻一半
The next youngest guy in his class was half his age.

791
01:01:41,140 --> 01:01:43,170
他们必定认为这老人家
They must have thought he was some far-out old man...

792
01:01:43,380 --> 01:01:45,400
无法完成课程
humping it over that course.

793
01:01:46,310 --> 01:01:49,810
我16岁入读  几乎要了我的命
I did it when I was 1 6. It damn near wasted me.

794
01:01:52,550 --> 01:01:54,920
他真有种
A tough motherfucker.

795
01:01:56,160 --> 01:01:58,060
完成了课程
He finished it.

796
01:02:00,260 --> 01:02:02,490
他不能晋升将军
He could have gone for general...

797
01:02:03,770 --> 01:02:07,170
但选择了自己道路
but he went for himself instead.

798
01:02:09,170 --> 01:02:13,700
亲爱的伊娃：今天很特别
Dear Eva...Today was really a new one.

799
01:02:14,080 --> 01:02:17,510
差点被老虎生吞
Almost got eaten alive by a fuckin' tiger.

800
01:02:18,850 --> 01:02:21,110
真的难以想像
Really un-fucking believable, you know?

801
01:02:21,320 --> 01:02:23,910
我们要带伟利上尉  逆流而上
We're taking this guy, Captain Willard, up the river...

802
01:02:24,120 --> 01:02:26,920
但他不肯讲出目的地
but he hasn't told us yet where we're taking him.

803
01:02:30,120 --> 01:02:32,850
或许你现在已知道
Thought you might have heard by now from Elwood.

804
01:02:33,230 --> 01:02:35,220
1967年10月
October 1 667.

805
01:02:35,460 --> 01:02:38,330
在康通县一次特别任务
On special assignment kontoom Province, II Corps.

806
01:02:38,530 --> 01:02:42,400
古华特与本地军一起执行
kurtz staged Operation Archangel with combined local forces.

807
01:02:42,600 --> 01:02:44,660
取得重大胜利
Rated a major success.

808
01:02:48,040 --> 01:02:50,700
他没有请示上级
He received no official clearance.

809
01:02:50,910 --> 01:02:52,710
只是想到要做  便做了
He just thought it up and did it.

810
01:02:54,680 --> 01:02:56,810
有勇气
What balls.

811
01:02:58,090 --> 01:03:01,060
他们本打算惩罚他
They were gonna nail his ass to the floorboards for that one.

812
01:03:01,260 --> 01:03:02,620
但事件被新闻界揭露
But after the press got ahold of it...

813
01:03:02,860 --> 01:03:06,260
反而晋升他为上校
they promoted him to full colonel instead.

814
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:09,860
噢
Oh, man,

815
01:03:10,100 --> 01:03:12,570
越南充满谎言和怪诞
the bullshit piled up so fast in Vietnam.

816
01:03:12,800 --> 01:03:15,460
要抽离很不容易
You needed wings to stay above it.

817
01:03:43,870 --> 01:03:47,270
在丛林中  这很不寻常
This sure enough is a bizarre sight in the middle of this shit.

818
01:03:48,800 --> 01:03:50,900
在等我们?
Expecting us this time?

819
01:03:52,970 --> 01:03:54,740
鬼才知道
Damned if I know.

820
01:04:02,250 --> 01:04:03,680
天呀!
Jesus--

821
01:04:10,220 --> 01:04:13,020
-它缩回卡车里了  -什么?
-It goes back up into the truck.  -What?

822
01:04:13,230 --> 01:04:15,530
我们必须让它们立起来
We gotta get all that stuff up.

823
01:04:21,740 --> 01:04:24,260
贺符  你来过这里吗  大厨?
Hau Phat. You ever been up here before, Chef?

824
01:04:24,470 --> 01:04:25,840
我打赌这可以买毒品
I bet you we can score up here.

825
01:04:26,040 --> 01:04:29,010
看看那些单车  兰斯
Check out the bikes, Lance.

826

829
01:04:40,920 --> 01:04:42,320
-求你  -一定是他
-Please!  -This must be the guy.

830
01:04:42,560 --> 01:04:44,050
在那里
Right over there.

831

3桶柴油

快点  走开  我们没时间了
Come on, man! Move!We don't have time.

834
01:04:58,410 --> 01:05:00,100
只有1小时  你要什么?
One hour. That's all. What do you want?

835
01:05:00,240 --> 01:05:04,180
-能给我点巴拿马红色大麻吗?  -没问题
-Can I get some Panama Red?  -Yeah, I'll get you Panama Red.

836
01:05:04,380 --> 01:05:06,870
-军士?  -目的地?
-Sergeant?  -Destination?

837
01:05:07,080 --> 01:05:07,950
我没有目的地
I don't have no destination.

838
01:05:08,710 --> 01:05:10,350
没有目的地  不可买东西
I can't do a goddamn thing without a destination.

839
01:05:10,550 --> 01:05:12,880
-军士?  -有目的地吗?
-Sarge? Sarge?  -I need a destination!

840
01:05:13,090 --> 01:05:15,610
我要目的地  否则办不到
I can't do a thing about it with a destination.

841
01:05:15,820 --> 01:05:19,280
军士  他们跟我一起的  目的地保密
These guys are with me. Destination's classifiIed.

842
01:05:19,490 --> 01:05:21,890
我有情报部门的优先文件
I carry priority papers from Com-Sec Intelligence.

843
01:05:22,100 --> 01:05:24,860
好的  长官  听着  今晚有大行动

难怪库尔兹激怒上级
No wonder kurtz put a weed up Command's ass.

897
01:11:36,650 --> 01:11:39,350
战争由无能的四星小丑们指挥
The war was being run by a bunch of four-star clowns...

898
01:11:39,560 --> 01:11:42,790

这次机会真难得
Hey, you know, man, that was far-fucking-out.

901
01:11:49,310 --> 01:11:50,960
我便收集她的每张照片
since she was Miss December, Chief.

902
01:11:51,180 --> 01:11:54,050
克林  看! 这有她!

但没有回音
She didn't write me back.

905
01:11:57,490 --> 01:11:59,420
很多人也爱上了这些骚货
You can really get hung up on these broads, man...

就像那只  三角洲  的猫

907
01:12:01,190 --> 01:12:03,220
-你最好相信  -什么猫?

瞧这漂亮的乳房!

他在南越陆军巡逻队工作

916
01:12:22,470 --> 01:12:25,760
有个自大的混账越南中尉

一天  越南人拿走他的杂志
One day the gook took his magazine

918
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:29,130
不肯交还
and wouldn't give it back.

919
01:12:29,340 --> 01:12:31,070
他说   还给我杂志
He said, ''Give me my magazine back.''

920
01:12:31,270 --> 01:12:33,440
那越南鬼说  闭嘴
Gook say, ''You shut up.

921
01:12:33,440 --> 01:12:35,610
我已把你告上了军事法庭
I have you court-martialed.''

922
01:12:35,880 --> 01:12:37,900
-典型的南越军人  -没错
-Typical fuckin' ARVN.  -Yeah!

923
01:12:38,050 --> 01:12:39,930
随后  那越南人开始过分了
Then the gook starts to go too far.

924
01:12:39,930 --> 01:12:41,810
大厨  来开船

这家伙开始在相片的乳房上乱捅

拿开你那双脏爪
You leave your shitty little gook hands off of that girl.

929

别那样对她

930
01:12:59,620 --> 01:13:04,750
-越南人用越南语说  操你妈的  -该死
-Gook say ''Fuck you'' in Vietnamese.  -Damn.

931
01:13:05,010 --> 01:13:07,640
军士忍无可忍
The sergeant couldn't handle it no more.

932
01:13:07,780 --> 01:13:09,770
他拿起枪
He just picked up his iron...

933
01:13:10,050 --> 01:13:13,710
拉开保险

01:13:14,220 --> 01:13:17,380
一个长连射穿过《花花公子》
Gave that little zero a long burst straight through the Playboy mag.

935
01:13:17,590 --> 01:13:20,250
把越南人轰了个稀巴烂
It blew his ass clean off of the dock.

936
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:22,790
中尉当场死掉
There wasn't no more lieutenant that day.

937
01:13:22,890 --> 01:13:25,420
就是这样
That was it for his ass.

938

被控谋杀

真该给这家伙一枚银星勋章

他们就会一直是外行

和其他一切开心事照旧

973
01:15:56,380 --> 01:15:59,820
我们的指挥就只会虚弱无力
our conduct of the war will gain only impotence.

974
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:01,280
我们要精锐部队
We need fewer men, and better.

975
01:16:01,480 --> 01:16:03,480
如果他们肯献身
If they were committed, this war could be won...

他们到底以为自己在干什么?

其中两个男的是南越军上校

敌军在他老防区的活动逐渐停止
Enemy activity in his old sector dropped off to nothing.

996
01:17:59,260 --> 01:18:02,290
估计这四人他杀对了

997
01:18:04,300 --> 01:18:06,740
他加入了特种部队

若他改过  一切既往不咎

01:18:19,420 --> 01:18:21,150
但他一意孤行

和他的这支越南山民军一道

1007
01:18:26,220 --> 01:18:27,320
这时  上级要我出马
And they called me in.

1008

他们奉他若神明
Man like a god and follow every order,

只有谣言或零星情报传出

1013
01:18:44,240 --> 01:18:46,870
主要来自被俘的越共

01:18:48,210 --> 01:18:52,340
越共都知他大名  全惧怕他
The VC knew his name by now, and they were scared of him.

01:19:03,200 --> 01:19:05,630
我要去白宫
I'm goin' to the White House to have dinner...

1019
01:19:05,830 --> 01:19:08,930
和总统共进午餐  宝贝
with the president of the United States.

1020
01:19:09,130 --> 01:19:11,130
我就要去那
That's where I'm goin'.

1021
01:19:11,370 --> 01:19:13,860
大厨  盖上盖
Hey, Chef, put the cover on that.

1022
01:19:15,410 --> 01:19:17,030
克林
Clean.

1023
01:19:20,550 --> 01:19:22,980
他在船上多久了?
How long has that kid been on this boat?

1024
01:19:23,180 --> 01:19:24,980
7个月
Seven months.

1025
01:19:25,480 --> 01:19:28,680
他真是会惹我生气
He's really specializing in busting my balls.

1026
01:19:28,920 --> 01:19:31,650
很可能  上尉  他也有同感
Very possible, Captain, he thinks the same of you.

1027
01:19:31,820 --> 01:19:35,320
是吗?  你有何高见  酋长?
Oh, yeah? What do you think, Chief?

1028
01:19:35,630 --> 01:19:37,250
我没想法
I don't think.

1029
01:19:37,360 --> 01:19:38,990
上级不让我知道
My orders say I'm not supposed to know

1030
01:19:39,200 --> 01:19:41,560
要开船去哪  所以我没想法
where I'm taking this boat so I don't!

1031
01:19:41,770 --> 01:19:43,800
但一见你  不管是哪
But one look at you, and I know it's gonna be hot,

1032
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:45,830
就知会有危险
wherever it is.

1033
01:19:55,950 --> 01:19:57,850
我们去上游
We're going upriver

1034
01:19:57,850 --> 01:19:59,750
距都朗桥约75公里
about 7 5 clicks above the Do Lung Bridge.

1035
01:20:04,120 --> 01:20:05,610
那里是柬埔寨  上尉
That's Cambodia, Captain.

1036
01:20:05,610 --> 01:20:07,090
是机密任务
That's classifiIed.

1037
01:20:08,160 --> 01:20:09,750
我们不该进柬埔寨
We're not supposed to be in Cambodia,

1038
01:20:09,960 --> 01:20:11,900
但那就是我要去的地方
but that's where I'm going.

1039
01:20:13,670 --> 01:20:15,710
你只管靠近我的目的地
You just get me close to my destination

1040
01:20:15,710 --> 01:20:17,760
然后你和船员们便可离开
and I'll cut you and the crew loose.

1041
01:20:20,490 --> 01:20:22,280
好吧  上尉
All right, Captain.

1042
01:20:43,880 --> 01:20:45,570
亲爱的儿子
''Dear Son...

1043
01:20:46,050 --> 01:20:47,310
你和你母亲在过去的几星期
I'm afraid that both you and your mother

1044
01:20:47,310 --> 01:20:48,570
没我的消息
will have been worried...

1045
01:20:48,880 --> 01:20:51,750
恐怕担心坏了
at not hearing from me during the past weeks...

1046
01:20:51,850 --> 01:20:55,190
但我的处境变得艰难了
but my situation here has become a difficult one.

1047
01:20:55,790 --> 01:20:59,620
我正式被军方控以谋杀
I have been officially accused of murder by the army.

1048
01:21:05,970 --> 01:21:07,580
所谓的受害人
The alleged victims

1049
01:21:07,580 --> 01:21:09,200
是4名越南双面间谍
were four Vietnamese double agents.

1050
01:21:09,400 --> 01:21:11,370
我们花了数月搜集证据
We spent months uncovering them

1051
01:21:11,370 --> 01:21:13,340
好揭穿他们
and accumulating evidence.

1052
01:21:15,210 --> 01:21:17,470
当铁证如山时  我们便行动了
When absolute proof was completed, we acted--

1053
01:21:17,680 --> 01:21:19,940
像军人一样果敢
we acted like soldiers.

1054
01:21:20,710 --> 01:21:23,050
指控是不公正的
The charges are unjustified.

1055
01:21:23,250 --> 01:21:26,850
实际上  他们在这种混乱局面下
They are, in fact, and in the circumstances of this conflict...

1056
01:21:27,120 --> 01:21:29,780
已完全失去理智
quite completely insane.

1057
01:21:39,800 --> 01:21:42,050
在战争中
In a war,

1058
01:21:42,050 --> 01:21:44,290
许多时刻要宽容怜悯
there are many moments for compassion and tender action.

1059
01:21:44,570 --> 01:21:47,300
还有许多时刻要冷酷无情
There are many moments for ruthless action--

1060
01:21:47,440 --> 01:21:49,880
通常所谓的  冷酷无情
what is often called ruthless...

1061
01:21:50,060 --> 01:21:53,360
在许多情况下  或许只是头脑清晰
but may in many circumstances be only clarity--

1062
01:21:53,560 --> 01:21:55,830
看清了要做什么  并果断行动
seeing clearly what there is to be done and doing it--''

1063
01:21:56,070 --> 01:21:58,090
-派救伤直升机来  完毕  -直接
-Medevac, come in.  -''directly--

1064
01:21:58,270 --> 01:21:59,150
迅速  清醒
quickly, awake.

1065
01:21:59,150 --> 01:22:00,030
阿尔法  探戈  探戈
Alpha, Tango, Tango,

1066
01:22:00,240 --> 01:22:02,030
-回话  探戈  阿尔法  -看哪
-Echo, Tango, Alpha.  -Looking at it.

1067
01:22:02,240 --> 01:22:05,110
请求救伤直升机  有3  4个人阵亡了  完毕
Request dust-off.Three, maybe four kIA 's. Over.

1068
01:22:05,310 --> 01:22:06,990
对这封信
I trust you

1069
01:22:06,990 --> 01:22:08,680
我相信你能有选择的告诉你母亲
tell your mother what you choose about this letter.

1070
01:22:08,900 --> 01:22:12,090
至于对我的指控  我不在乎
As for the charges against me, I am unconcerned.

1071
01:22:12,300 --> 01:22:13,390
派救伤直升机来
Medevac, come in.

1072
01:22:13,600 --> 01:22:15,800
我看不起他们懦弱  虚伪的道德观
I am beyond their timid, lying morality,

1073
01:22:15,800 --> 01:22:18,000
所以心中再无牵挂
and so I am beyond caring.

1074
01:22:18,310 --> 01:22:19,770
救伤直升机  收到了吗?  完毕
Medevac, do you read?  Over.

1075
01:22:19,870 --> 01:22:22,000
我完全信任你
You have all my faith.

1076
01:22:22,310 --> 01:22:24,470
爱你的父亲
Your loving father.

1077
01:22:43,700 --> 01:22:44,790
天哪!
Jesus.

1078
01:22:44,970 --> 01:22:47,590
难怪我和他们无线电联络不上
No wonder I couldn't get 'em on the radio.

1079
01:22:47,800 --> 01:22:49,890
好一片废墟!
What a dump.

1080
01:22:53,870 --> 01:22:55,430
-你好! -你怎样?
-Hi there!  -How ya doin'?

1081
01:22:55,710 --> 01:22:57,800
小船不错
That's a nice little boat you got there.

1082
01:22:57,950 --> 01:22:59,280
以前从没船来
Never seen one up here before.

1083
01:22:59,480 --> 01:23:01,230
我们叫过救援直升机
We called in a request for Medevac.

1084
01:23:01,230 --> 01:23:02,970
你们收到了吗?
You receive it?

1085
01:23:03,180 --> 01:23:04,980
救援直升机?  没见
Medevac? No.

1086
01:23:05,190 --> 01:23:06,950
倒是经过一架坠毁的休伊直升机  
We passed a downed Huey with

1087
01:23:06,950 --> 01:23:07,620
里面有阵亡者
some kIA's.

1088
01:23:08,060 --> 01:23:10,720
-在你们来这的路上?  -是的
-On your way here?  -Yeah.

1089
01:23:10,920 --> 01:23:13,890
-那你们要去上游喽?  -是的
-You goin' up this river?  -Way up.

1090
01:23:14,190 --> 01:23:16,750
去上游? 算了吧
Way upriver? Forget it.

1091
01:23:16,860 --> 01:23:17,960
为什么?
Why?

1092
01:23:18,200 --> 01:23:21,100
我们想送几个人去下游
We want to send some people downriver.

1093
01:23:21,270 --> 01:23:23,900
-别去了  -究竟怎么回事?
-Just forget it.  -What the fuck was that?

1094
01:23:24,100 --> 01:23:25,920
我们几天后回来
We'll be back in a couple of days.

1095
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:27,730
没错  你们会回来
Yeah, right, you'll be back.

1096
01:23:34,410 --> 01:23:36,180
-酋长?  -什么事  上尉?
-Chief?  -Yeah, Captain?

1097
01:23:36,380 --> 01:23:38,040
你看看引擎吧
Why don't you see what you can do with that engine?

1098
01:23:38,250 --> 01:23:40,190
-我要去四下瞧瞧  -好的
-I'm gonna look around.  -All right.

1099
01:23:40,390 --> 01:23:42,320
别丢下我
Hey, don't leave without me.

1100
01:24:04,700 --> 01:24:06,720
大兵  你的指挥官呢?
Hey, soldier, where's your CO?

1101
01:24:06,930 --> 01:24:09,160
别问我
Don't ask me, man.

1102
01:24:29,950 --> 01:24:33,050
还我的衣服  混蛋!
Give my clothes back, you asshole!

1103
01:24:35,440 --> 01:24:37,310
该死的混蛋!
Asshole!

1104
01:24:42,180 --> 01:24:45,210
指挥官在哪?
Hey, guys, where's the CO?

1105
01:24:45,420 --> 01:24:47,750
他两个月前踩中地雷
He stepped on a land mine about two months ago.

1106
01:24:47,750 --> 01:24:50,080
完蛋了
He got blown to hell.

1107
01:24:50,290 --> 01:24:52,920
-这里谁管事?  -管事?
-Who's in charge here?  -Charge?

1108
01:24:53,160 --> 01:24:55,060
不知道  我只管巡夜
I don't know, man. I'm just the night man.

1109
01:24:55,230 --> 01:24:57,030
听命而为  妈的
Just do what I'm told. Shit.

1110
01:24:57,030 --> 01:24:58,820
我只是个打工妹
I'm just a working girl.

1111
01:24:59,030 --> 01:25:01,160

用两桶燃料换取

1136

你要用我们的燃料
You're giving away our fuel

不  是年度玩伴  酋长

我要你告诉我她怎么样
I want you to tell me how she was.

1158
01:27:53,110 --> 01:27:58,310
啊  小鸟  你怎么弄到的?
Hey, oiseau. How come you got a bird?

1159

我以前在布希公园当雀女郎

1163
01:28:11,110 --> 01:28:12,870
松了吗?
Is it coming?

1164
01:28:19,730 --> 01:28:23,400
-十二月小姐是黑发  -在那边
-Miss December has black hair.  -It's over there.

1165
01:28:23,600 --> 01:28:26,440
它不是我训练的那些小鸟
He's not one of my regular birds.

1166
01:28:27,240 --> 01:28:29,190
来吧  宝贝  吃块饼干
Come on. Come on, baby. Snack?

1167
01:28:29,190 --> 01:28:31,140
吃块饼干  过来
Snatch a crack. Come here.

1168
01:28:31,380 --> 01:28:34,400
当上年度玩伴
Being playmate of the year...

1169
01:28:34,610 --> 01:28:38,710
是我能想到的最孤独的经历
is the loneliest experience I can imagine.

1170
01:28:39,290 --> 01:28:42,920
就象你想
It's like--You try to express...

1171
01:28:43,120 --> 01:28:47,220
向人表达情感  坦露心事
your feelings to someone and show them your heart--

1172
01:28:47,430 --> 01:28:49,420
我想听你的驯鸟表演
Yeah, I want to hear about your bird act.

1173
01:28:49,630 --> 01:28:51,650
我喜欢听你的驯鸟表演
I'd love to hear about your bird act.

1174
01:28:51,870 --> 01:28:55,890
但你不介意戴上这吧?
But would you mind just puttin' this--

1175
01:28:56,340 --> 01:29:00,710
为我戴上这黑色假发  成吗?
Would you just mind putting this black wig on for me, please?

1176
01:29:00,910 --> 01:29:03,400
而中间却多了道玻璃墙
And there's this glass wall between you--

1177
01:29:03,610 --> 01:29:05,810
看不见的玻璃
this invisible glass.

1178
01:29:06,080 --> 01:29:09,070
他们能看见你嘴在动
They can see your mouth moving.

1179
01:29:09,220 --> 01:29:11,150
我训练小鸟至少有两年了
I used to train birds for at least two years--

1180
01:29:11,350 --> 01:29:13,080
-真美  -在布希公园
-That's beautiful.  -at Busch Gardens.

1181
01:29:13,290 --> 01:29:15,130
头发散落右肩
This was cascading over your right shoulder.

1182
01:29:15,130 --> 01:29:16,980
这里张开
This was open here.

1183
01:29:17,460 --> 01:29:20,050
他们却听不见你所说的
But they can't hear what you're saying.

1184
01:29:20,360 --> 01:29:23,420
我训练它们倒立  倒转飞
I used to train them to stand on their head

1185
01:29:23,530 --> 01:29:24,790
骑小单车
and ride a bicycle--

1186
01:29:24,980 --> 01:29:27,710
-你右手有点  -嗨  大厨!
-Your right hand was--  -Hey, Chef!

1187
01:29:28,720 --> 01:29:31,550
-滚开! -快  大厨!
-Get outta here, man!  -Come on!

1188
01:29:31,860 --> 01:29:33,420
有人想和你谈谈
Does he want to talk to you?

1189
01:29:33,420 --> 01:29:34,980
等会  给我15分钟
Later. Give me 1 5 minutes.

1190
01:29:35,090 --> 01:29:36,890
因为你压根没法让他们
You can never really make them hear

1191
01:29:37,090 --> 01:29:39,030
听见你要说的
what you're trying to say.

1192
01:29:39,230 --> 01:29:41,290
弯弯腰可以吗?  就是这样
You okay with kind of bending? That's it.

1193
01:29:41,600 --> 01:29:44,860
你的屁股有点翘  嘿  滚开!
Your ass was sticking out just a little--Hey, man, fuck off!

1194
01:29:44,990 --> 01:29:46,850
15分钟!
Fifteen minutes!

1195
01:29:47,250 --> 01:29:50,190
所以我拼命要
That's why I tried so desperately...

1196
01:29:50,920 --> 01:29:54,380
证明我有才能
to show somebody that I had some talent.

1197
01:29:54,590 --> 01:29:56,120

01:29:56,330 --> 01:29:59,090
-你见过吗?  -就这样打开
-Have you ever seen a baby macaw?  -That's kind of open there.

1199
01:29:59,400 --> 01:30:01,870
-它们都是蓝色和金色的  -来  脱掉吧!
-They're all blue-- -Take off, would you?

1200
01:30:02,690 --> 01:30:05,020
我有权利!
I got my rights, man!

1201
01:30:05,220 --> 01:30:07,690
他们逼你做你不想做的事
They make you do things you don't wanna do--

1202
01:30:07,890 --> 01:30:09,020
就象
like,

1203
01:30:09,230 --> 01:30:12,660

1204
01:30:14,700 --> 01:30:18,600
我开始讨厌自己
I started feeling repulsed with myself.

1205
01:30:18,800 --> 01:30:22,260
你往前弯点  你的屁股有点翘
You were just kind of bending forward. Your ass kind of out a bit.

1206
01:30:22,470 --> 01:30:24,940
我喜欢训练小鸟

1207

就这样  很好  就这样
That's it. That's very--That's it. Voila.

1209
01:30:32,780 --> 01:30:35,580
真不敢相信
You know, I can't believe it.

我  杰伊希克斯
Me,J. Hicks. I can't believe

或许我不配和
Maybe I'm unfiIt to have a relationship...

1213
01:30:45,060 --> 01:30:49,760
帅气  纯真的少年发生关系
with a beautiful, innocent boy.

1214
01:30:50,000 --> 01:30:53,230
试想想  如果不是越战

我永远不会遇见你  十二月小姐

我不愿做的事
that I didn't want to do.

1235
01:32:15,300 --> 01:32:19,170
比如  他们说  在双腿间拉丝带

考虑到他家人  西贡将他列入了失踪名单

可他们认为他死了

永远不会失去它  永远!
We will never lose it. Never!

1593
02:05:52,830 --> 02:05:55,120
你们美国人
You Americans.

1594
02:05:56,260 --> 02:06:00,760
在1945年
In 1 945, yeah...

1595
02:06:01,080 --> 02:06:03,050
对日作战后
after the Japanese war,

1596
02:06:03,990 --> 02:06:06,480
你们的总统罗斯福
your President Roosevelt

1597
02:06:06,480 --> 02:06:08,980
不想让法国人留在印度支那
didn't want the French people to stay in Indochina.

1598
02:06:10,590 --> 02:06:15,460
所以你们美国人  安插进越盟(追随胡志明)
So...you Americans implant the Vietminh.

1599
02:06:17,530 --> 02:06:19,400
-他什么意思?  -这是真的
-What's he mean?  -Yeah, that's true.

1600
02:06:19,520 --> 02:06:21,920
越共由美国人创建
The Vietcong were invented by the Americans.

1601
02:06:23,320 --> 02:06:24,290
美国人?
The Americans?

1602
02:06:24,920 --> 02:06:27,390
现在  你们取代了法国
And now you take the French place...

1603
02:06:27,660 --> 02:06:29,820
于是  越盟打你们
and the Vietminh fiIght you.

1604
02:06:29,960 --> 02:06:31,690
你们能怎样?
And what can you do?

1605
02:06:31,930 --> 02:06:32,990
束手无策
Nothing.

1606
02:06:33,200 --> 02:06:34,500
完全束手无策
Absolutely nothing.

1607
02:06:34,700 --> 02:06:36,280
越南人很聪明
The Vietnamese are very intelligent.

1608
02:06:36,280 --> 02:06:37,860
你从不知道他们的想法
You never know what they think.

1609
02:06:38,070 --> 02:06:39,880
他们找苏联人帮忙
The Russian ones who help them,

1610
02:06:39,880 --> 02:06:41,700
说来给我们钱
Come and give us their money.

1611
02:06:41,940 --> 02:06:43,790
我们都是共产党  找中国人说
We are all Communists. Chinese,

1612
02:06:43,790 --> 02:06:45,640
给我们武器  我们都是兄弟
give us guns. We are all brothers.''

1613
02:06:45,810 --> 02:06:47,840
他们讨厌中国人!
They hate the Chinese!

1614
02:06:48,150 --> 02:06:50,120
比起苏联人和中国人
Maybe they hate the American

1615
02:06:50,120 --> 02:06:52,080
他们也许还不那么讨厌美国人
less than the Russian and the Chinese.

1616
02:06:52,550 --> 02:06:54,540
就是说  如果明天越南人成了共产党
I mean, if tomorrow the Vietnamese are Communists...

1617
02:06:54,750 --> 02:06:56,950
他们也会是  越南  共产党
they will be Vietnamese Communists.

1618
02:06:57,190 --> 02:07:00,820
这点  你们美国人永远不会明白
And this is something that you never understood, you American.

1619
02:07:00,990 --> 02:07:02,930
我不知道  或许将来
I don't know.

1620
02:07:03,130 --> 02:07:05,460
我们会与越盟和解
Maybe in the future we can make something with the Vietminh.

1621
02:07:05,660 --> 02:07:07,530
你不明白吗?
Don't you understand?

1622
02:07:07,730 --> 02:07:10,460
越共说  走开  走开
The VC say, ''Go away. Go away.''

1623
02:07:10,670 --> 02:07:13,100
所有白人  都无法呆在印度支那
That's fiInish for all the white people in Indochina.

1624
02:07:13,310 --> 02:07:16,600
法国人和美国人并无分别
If you're French, American, that's all the same.

1625
02:07:16,810 --> 02:07:19,610
走吧  他们想忘掉你们
''Go.'' They want to forget you.

1626
02:07:19,810 --> 02:07:21,280
瞧  上尉
Look, Captain.

1627
02:07:22,550 --> 02:07:24,040
这是事实
Look,this is the truth.

1628
02:07:24,780 --> 02:07:25,750
一只鸡蛋
An egg.

1629
02:07:28,450 --> 02:07:30,450
蛋白流走
The white left...

1630
02:07:31,240 --> 02:07:34,210
可蛋黄仍在
but the yellow stays!

1631
02:07:41,280 --> 02:07:45,080
我在西贡时  跟一个美国政客谈过
When I was in Saigon, I spoke to an American politician.

1632
02:07:45,290 --> 02:07:47,220
他解释得很好  他说:
He explained it very well. He said, ''Look.

1633
02:07:47,420 --> 02:07:51,330
瞧  昨天是朝鲜  今天是越南
Yesterday, it was korea. Today, Vietnam.

1634
02:07:51,640 --> 02:07:55,080
明天是泰国  菲律宾
Tomorrow, Thailand, the Philippines...

1635
02:07:55,180 --> 02:07:57,050
之后  可能是欧洲
then maybe Europe.''

1636
02:07:58,980 --> 02:07:59,970
为什么不会是欧洲?
Come on. Why not Europe?

1637
02:08:00,120 --> 02:08:02,520
看看捷克斯洛伐克  最近发生的
Look what happened in Czechoslovakia recently.

1638
02:08:02,720 --> 02:08:04,190
甚至在二战前
Even before Second World War

1639
02:08:04,420 --> 02:08:06,390
美国人就知道了  要发生什么事
Americans knew exactly what was going on.

1640
02:08:06,560 --> 02:08:09,120
他们不想那混蛋接管
They don't want that shit to take over! LeFevre!

1641
02:08:11,780 --> 02:08:14,180
你们白人都是混蛋
All you white people are shit.

1642
02:08:14,350 --> 02:08:16,510
他们在为自由抗争
They are fiIghting--fiIghting for freedom.

1643
02:08:16,720 --> 02:08:18,710
自由?  胡扯
Freedom? Bullshit.

1644
02:08:18,920 --> 02:08:21,820
法国人胡话  美国人胡话
French bullshit. American bullshit.

1645
02:08:22,120 --> 02:08:24,460
奠边府的陷阱
Dien Bien Phu, that serious.

1646
02:08:24,630 --> 02:08:28,360
所有士兵  都知道他们已经完了
All soldiers know they are already dead.

1647
02:08:29,870 --> 02:08:31,700
你知道奠边府战役吗?
You know anything about Dien Bien Phu?

1648
02:08:34,900 --> 02:08:36,600
-我知道  -不  你不知道
-Yeah, I know.  -No, you don't.

1649
02:08:37,840 --> 02:08:38,810
不真的知道
Not really.

1650
02:08:39,010 --> 02:08:42,000
奠边府是个错误  一个军事错误
Dien Bien Phu was an error.A military mistake.

1651
02:08:42,210 --> 02:08:44,480
错误?  是个故意的错误!
A mistake? A voluntary mistake!

1652
02:08:44,680 --> 02:08:46,380
故意的!
Voluntary!

1653
02:08:48,320 --> 02:08:50,580
所有士兵都知道
All the soldiers knew.

1654
02:08:50,820 --> 02:08:52,520
我们知道自己会死
We knew we would be dead.

1655
02:08:52,520 --> 02:08:54,220
那些将军和上校以为
The generals and the colonels believe it's impossible for the Viets...

1656
02:08:54,360 --> 02:08:58,120
越南人不可能运大炮上山
to get the cannon up there in the mountains.

1657
02:08:58,330 --> 02:08:59,760
但他们办到了
But they do.

1658
02:09:00,030 --> 02:09:03,460
然后等着下雨
Then they wait for the rain to come.

1659
02:09:03,920 --> 02:09:08,050
雨下起来后  没有飞机能到那
When it comes, no airplane can fly there.

1660
02:09:08,420 --> 02:09:11,220
我们的伞兵  从90米高往下跳下
And our paratroopers jump at 90 meters.

1661
02:09:11,260 --> 02:09:13,720
90米  70米
I mean, you know, 90 meters--70 meters.

1662
02:09:13,930 --> 02:09:15,560
真是发疯
I mean, that's crazy.

1663
02:09:15,560 --> 02:09:17,190
没哪支军队会那样干
No army in the world can do that.

1664
02:09:17,800 --> 02:09:21,230
他们只想跟朋友们死在一起
And they only do that to be dead with their friends.

1665
02:09:27,540 --> 02:09:29,770
法国军队被牺牲了
The French Army was sacrifiIced.

1666
02:09:29,980 --> 02:09:32,540
被安安稳稳在家的政客们牺牲了
SacrifiIced by the politicians safe at home.

1667
02:09:32,750 --> 02:09:33,600
他们把军队推入了
They put the army in an impossible situation

1668
02:09:34,310 --> 02:09:35,870
不可能取胜的境地
where they couldn't win.

1669
02:09:36,720 --> 02:09:40,050
学生们在巴黎游行示威
The students are marching in Paris protesting, demonstrating.

1670
02:09:40,250 --> 02:09:42,280
从背后捅了士兵们一刀
They stab the soldiers in their back.

1671
02:09:42,490 --> 02:09:44,820
士兵要拉响手雷
The soldier would open the grenade,

1672
02:09:45,020 --> 02:09:46,320
它却不会爆炸
it wouldn't work.

1673
02:09:46,530 --> 02:09:48,720
一张字条掉了出来
A piece of paper would fall--

1674
02:09:50,800 --> 02:09:53,990
法国妇女联盟  我们支持越南
''Union of French Women.'' ''We are for the Viets.''

1675
02:09:54,300 --> 02:09:58,630
叛徒! 国内的共产党叛徒
Traitors! Communist traitors at home.

1676
02:09:59,670 --> 02:10:02,200
这就是奠边府
Dien Bien Phu, okay.

1677
02:10:02,840 --> 02:10:05,000
法国人是混蛋
The French is shit, huh?

1678
02:10:06,280 --> 02:10:08,610
没人关心  没人想要
No one care. No one want--

1679
02:10:11,120 --> 02:10:13,100
你们美国人为何
Why don't you Americans learn from us,

1680
02:10:13,100 --> 02:10:15,080
不从我们的错误中学乖?
from our mistakes?

1681
02:10:15,940 --> 02:10:17,110
依你们的军队  你们的实力
Mon Dieux, with your army, your strength your power,

1682
02:10:17,720 --> 02:10:19,500
只要你们想就能赢!
you could win if you want to!

1683
02:10:21,810 --> 02:10:23,570
你们能赢
You can win.

1684
02:10:26,750 --> 02:10:30,080
我肯定我们能在这有所作为
You know, I'm sure we can make something here.

1685
02:10:30,250 --> 02:10:32,220
我肯定
I'm sure about it, you know?

1686
02:10:32,420 --> 02:10:35,360
我从不亏待这里的人
I never do something wrong to the people here.

1687
02:10:35,560 --> 02:10:37,460
抱歉
That's right,

1688
02:10:37,460 --> 02:10:39,360
可国内的共产党从没背叛
but the Communist at home have never been traitors.

1689
02:11:14,630 --> 02:11:16,600
晚安  上尉
Capitaine, good night.

1690
02:11:16,800 --> 02:11:18,000
他是个社会主义者
He was a Socialist, you know.

1691
02:11:18,000 --> 02:11:19,200
我知道我们能留下
I know that we can stay.

1692
02:11:19,400 --> 02:11:22,630
我知道我们能留下并开创事业
I know that we can stay.We can.

1693
02:11:26,110 --> 02:11:29,510
我们经常帮越南人
You know, we always helped the people.

1694
02:11:29,730 --> 02:11:31,290
跟他们一起干活
We work with the people.

1695
02:11:32,400 --> 02:11:35,860
所以我们  可以推断自己是受欢迎的
So we can be friends, we are agreed.

1696
02:11:47,930 --> 02:11:52,230
瞧  上尉  我的祖父
See, Captain, when my grandfather...

1697
02:11:53,500 --> 02:11:56,940
和叔父刚来时
and my uncle's father came here...

1698
02:11:58,410 --> 02:12:01,870
这里一片荒芜
there was nothing--nothing.

1699
02:12:02,340 --> 02:12:04,900
越南什么也不是
The Vietnamese were nothing.

1700
02:12:06,520 --> 02:12:10,180
于是我们非常努力地工作
So we worked hard...

1701
02:12:10,390 --> 02:12:13,080
从巴西运来橡胶树
the rubber from Brazil,

1702
02:12:13,290 --> 02:12:15,420
种植在这里
and then plant it here.

1703
02:12:15,990 --> 02:12:21,730
我们雇用越南人  和他们一起干活
We took the Vietnamese, work with them...

1704
02:12:21,930 --> 02:12:24,660
从无到有
make something--something out of nothing.

1705
02:12:25,530 --> 02:12:29,870
你问我为何我们想留下  上尉
So when you ask me why we want to stay here, Captain...

1706
02:12:30,810 --> 02:12:33,040
我们想留下  因为这地方是我们的
we want to stay here because it's ours

1707
02:12:33,280 --> 02:12:36,900
它属于我们  令我们的家人团结
it belongs to us.It keeps our family together.

1708
02:12:38,810 --> 02:12:40,710
我们为此而战
I mean, we fiIght for that.

1709
02:12:42,800 --> 02:12:44,890
而你们美国人
While you Americans, you are fiIghting for...

1710
02:12:45,340 --> 02:12:51,300
却为史上最虚无的东西而战
the biggest nothing in history.

1711
02:12:58,180 --> 02:13:00,410
对不起  上尉
I'm sorry, Captain.

1712
02:13:00,620 --> 02:13:02,970
我会去看看你们的人
I will see if your men need any help

1713
02:13:02,970 --> 02:13:05,320
是否需要东西修船
to repair your boat...

1714
02:13:05,520 --> 02:13:09,320
好继续你们的战争
so that you can go on with your war.

1715
02:13:44,210 --> 02:13:47,240
我为我的家人向你道歉  上尉
I apologize for my family, Captain.

1716
02:13:48,820 --> 02:13:51,120
我们都在这里失去了很多
We have all lost much here.

1717
02:13:52,320 --> 02:13:56,020
赫伯特失去了妻子和两个孩子
Hubert--his wife and two sons.

1718
02:14:00,010 --> 02:14:02,710
我失去了丈夫
And I have lost a husband.

1719
02:14:07,890 --> 02:14:09,680
我明白了
I understand.

1720
02:14:09,890 --> 02:14:12,520
你厌倦了战争
You are tired of the war.

1721
02:14:14,090 --> 02:14:16,720
我能从你脸上看出来
I can see it in your face.

1722
02:14:18,700 --> 02:14:22,830
和法国士兵眼神里的一个样
'Twas the same in the eyes of the soldiers of our war.

1723
02:14:24,440 --> 02:14:27,500
我们称他们为
We called them ''Les Soldats Perdus--''

1724
02:14:28,270 --> 02:14:30,610
迷失的士兵
The Lost Soldiers.

1725
02:14:34,900 --> 02:14:37,870
如果你愿意  我们可以来点科纳克白兰地
If you like, we can have some cognac.

1726
02:14:42,200 --> 02:14:43,640
不了
No.I...

1727
02:14:44,740 --> 02:14:48,180
我得去找我的部下  而且
I have to--to see about my men and--

1728
02:14:55,030 --> 02:14:58,200
明天  这里还会有战争
The war will be still here tomorrow.

1729
02:15:08,350 --> 02:15:10,640
是的  我想你是对的
Yeah, I guess you're right.

1730
02:15:18,460 --> 02:15:21,480
我注意到你晚餐时没喝酒
I noticed you had no wine at dinner.

1731
02:15:22,290 --> 02:15:25,890
我不喝酒
No, I don't drink wine.

1732
02:15:28,430 --> 02:15:30,960
我是喜欢科纳克
I do like cognac,

1733
02:15:30,960 --> 02:15:33,500
但现在不想喝  谢谢
but I don't want any now. Thank you.

1734
02:15:33,710 --> 02:15:35,670
好吧
Well...

1735
02:15:36,540 --> 02:15:39,910
我只好一个人喝了
then I--I must drink alone.

1736
02:15:49,700 --> 02:15:53,400
你战后会回美国吗?
Will you go back after the war to America?

1737
02:15:57,180 --> 02:15:58,370
不会
No.

1738
02:15:58,580 --> 02:16:02,480
那你跟我们一样  家就在这
Then you're like us--your home is here.

1739
02:16:19,550 --> 02:16:21,700
你知道人为什么
Do you know why you can never step

1740
02:16:21,700 --> 02:16:23,850
不能两次踏入同一条河流吗?
into the same river twice?

1741
02:16:25,720 --> 02:16:29,520
知道  因为它总在流动
Yeah. 'Cause it's always moving.

1742
02:16:30,230 --> 02:16:33,990
我以前常为丈夫准备一管
I used to prepare a pipe for my husband.

1743
02:16:40,620 --> 02:16:45,580
他心脏受伤  要靠吗啡止痛
'Twas the morphine he took for the wounds he suffered in his heart.

1744
02:16:48,530 --> 02:16:52,730
我那迷失的士兵  会大吵大嚷
He would rage and he would cry, my lost soldier.

1745
02:16:55,970 --> 02:16:58,530
我对他说
And I said to him,

1746
02:16:58,760 --> 02:17:02,560
你看不到有两个你吗?
There are two of you.Don't you see?

1747
02:17:02,860 --> 02:17:07,060
一个杀人  一个爱人
One that kills and one that loves.''

1748
02:17:08,670 --> 02:17:10,500
他对我说
And he said to me...

1749
02:17:11,170 --> 02:17:15,700
我不晓得自己  是畜生还是神
''I don't know whether I'm an animal or a god.''

1750
02:17:18,330 --> 02:17:20,290
但你两者皆是
But you are both.

1751
02:18:02,050 --> 02:18:04,210
还要吗?
You want more?

1752
02:18:09,290 --> 02:18:13,200
重要的是  你还活着
All that matters is that you're alive.

1753
02:18:14,770 --> 02:18:17,630
你还活着  上尉
You are alive, Captain.

1754
02:18:21,040 --> 02:18:23,170
这就是真相
That's the truth.

1755
02:19:36,460 --> 02:19:40,090
你看不到有两个你吗?
There are two of you, don't you see?

1756
02:19:41,300 --> 02:19:46,470
一个杀人  一个爱人
One that kills...and one that loves.

1757
02:20:14,820 --> 02:20:17,720
什么也看不见  停下
Can't see nothing. We stoppin'.

1758
02:20:17,920 --> 02:20:20,220
你无权停船  酋长
You're not authorized to stop this boat, Chief.

1759
02:20:20,410 --> 02:20:22,090
我说了什么也看不见
I said I can't see a thing,

1760
02:20:22,090 --> 02:20:23,780
上尉! 我要停船
Captain. I'm stopping this boat.

1761
02:20:23,980 --> 02:20:25,380
我不会再拿任何人冒险
I ain't riskin' no more lives.

1762
02:20:25,580 --> 02:20:26,460
这里由我指挥  妈的
I'm in command here, goddamn it.

1763
02:20:27,340 --> 02:20:29,110
你要听我的
You'll do what I say.

1764
02:20:30,690 --> 02:20:32,980
你看见什么了吗  大厨?
You see anything, Chef?

1765
02:20:34,860 --> 02:20:37,720
他们为什么不他妈的攻击?
Why don't they fucking attack, man?

1766
02:20:56,310 --> 02:20:58,110
小心这  酋长
Watch it over here, Chief.

1767
02:20:59,680 --> 02:21:01,270
有截断树桩
Got a stump.

1768
02:21:03,250 --> 02:21:05,720
兰斯  上50口径机枪
Lance,On the fiIfties.

1769
02:21:05,920 --> 02:21:08,010
他在附近
He was close.

1770
02:21:09,690 --> 02:21:12,180
相当近
He was real close.

1771
02:21:13,660 --> 02:21:16,430
我虽然看不见他  但却能感觉到
I couldn't see him yet, but I could feel him...

1772
02:21:16,630 --> 02:21:18,460
就像船只被卷入上游
as if the boat were being sucked upriver...

1773
02:21:18,670 --> 02:21:21,570
而河水会流回丛林
and the water was flowing backinto thejungle.

1774
02:21:24,110 --> 02:21:25,970
无论如何
Whatever was going to happen...

1775
02:21:26,740 --> 02:21:28,620
都和他们在老川
it wasn't going to be the way

1776
02:21:28,620 --> 02:21:30,510
形容的有天壤之别
they called it backin Nha Trang.

1777
02:21:35,110 --> 02:21:37,380
-有箭!  -开火!
-Arrows!  -Fire!

1778
02:21:39,990 --> 02:21:42,510
大厨  开火!
Chef, open up! Fire!

1779
02:21:46,330 --> 02:21:48,050
大厨  开火!
Lance, fiIre!

1780
02:21:56,300 --> 02:21:59,860
大厨! 没事了  停火
Chef! Chef, it's okay. Quit fiIring.

1781
02:21:59,970 --> 02:22:01,370
只是玩具箭
They're just little toy arrows.

1782
02:22:01,570 --> 02:22:03,540
闭嘴! 安静!
Cut it out! Quiet!

1783
02:22:03,780 --> 02:22:06,340
酋长  叫他们停火!
Chief, tell them to hold their fiIre!

1784
02:22:06,550 --> 02:22:07,910
不过是小树枝
They're just little sticks.

1785
02:22:07,910 --> 02:22:09,280
想吓唬我们
They're just trying to scare us.

1786
02:22:09,480 --> 02:22:11,420
安静!
Quiet!

1787
02:22:11,750 --> 02:22:12,700
你让我们陷入狼狈
You got us into this mess,

1788
02:22:12,950 --> 02:22:14,150
现在却无计可施
and now you can't get us out...

1789
02:22:14,450 --> 02:22:17,050
因为你也不知道究竟要去哪  是吧?
You got us into this mess, and now you can't get us out...

1790
02:22:17,160 --> 02:22:19,090
是吧?
Do ya?

1791
02:22:19,290 --> 02:22:22,690
你这混蛋!
You son of a bitch! You bastard!

1792
02:22:24,100 --> 02:22:26,220
兰斯  来开船!
Lance, get the wheel!

1793
02:22:26,830 --> 02:22:30,790
你们这些野蛮人  来尝尝吧! 你这混蛋!
You savages! Come and get it! You son of a bitches!

1794
02:22:50,860 --> 02:22:52,880
一支长矛
A spear?

1795
02:24:11,970 --> 02:24:15,170
我的任务是进柬埔寨
My mission is to make it up into Cambodia.

1796
02:24:15,370 --> 02:24:17,840
在那  有个绿色贝雷帽的上校疯了
There's a Green Beret colonel up there who's gone insane...

1797
02:24:18,140 --> 02:24:19,770
我要去处决他
and I'm supposed to kill him.

1798
02:24:21,280 --> 02:24:24,110
真有种!
That's fucking typical! Shit!

1799
02:24:24,280 --> 02:24:26,380
他妈的越南任务
Fuckin' Vietnam mission!

1800
02:24:26,550 --> 02:24:27,130
我们必须去那
I'm short and we gotta go up there

1801
02:24:28,320 --> 02:24:30,080
好让你杀个自己人?
so you can kill one of our own guys?

1802
02:24:30,290 --> 02:24:34,090
真他妈的好!
That's fucking great!

1803
02:24:35,060 --> 02:24:38,190
真他妈的发疯
Shit! That's fuckin' crazy.

1804
02:24:38,400 --> 02:24:41,300
我以为你要去炸座桥
I mean, I thought you were going in to blow up a bridge...

1805
02:24:41,500 --> 02:24:44,870
或铁路之类的
or some fuckin' railroad tracks or somethin'.

1806
02:24:45,340 --> 02:24:47,400
-对不起  -不  等等
-That's all right.  -No. No, wait. Wait.

1807
02:24:47,610 --> 02:24:50,630
我们一起坐船去
We'll go together, on the boat. We'll go with you.

1808
02:24:50,940 --> 02:24:55,070
一起坐船去  好吗?
We'll go up there, but on the boat. Okay?

1809
02:26:01,550 --> 02:26:03,520
我对到那后
Part of me was afraid of what I would find...

1810
02:26:03,650 --> 02:26:06,380
会发现和要做的事  有点恐惧
and what I would do when I got there.

1811
02:26:08,590 --> 02:26:10,680
我知道有危险
I knew the risks...

1812
02:26:11,420 --> 02:26:13,890
或假装自己知道
or imagined I knew.

1813
02:26:15,560 --> 02:26:20,830
但比恐惧感觉更强烈的
But the thing I felt the most...much stronger than fear...

1814
02:26:21,430 --> 02:26:24,400
是渴望面对他
was the desire to confront him.

1815
02:27:36,040 --> 02:27:37,980
继续前进
Just keep movin'.

1816
02:27:38,180 --> 02:27:42,610
兰斯  手离枪远点
Lance, keep your hands away from the guns.

1817
02:29:08,500 --> 02:29:12,630
没事! 允许你们进来了!
It's all right! It's all right! It's all been approved!

1818
02:29:12,830 --> 02:29:16,030
我才不进去! 那些混蛋会袭击我们!
I ain't comin' in there! Them bastards attacked us!

1819
02:29:16,870 --> 02:29:20,570
用汽笛吓跑他们!
Hey, zap 'em with your siren, man. Zap 'em with your siren.

1820
02:29:31,150 --> 02:29:33,090
那有水雷! 那也有!
There's mines over there and mines over there too.

1821
02:29:33,250 --> 02:29:36,350
小心  那些该死的猴子会咬人
And watch out. Those goddamn monkeys will bite you, I'll tell you.

1822
02:29:36,620 --> 02:29:39,790
真不错  朝着我开
Ah, that's a pretty one. Move it right in towards me.

1823
02:29:40,390 --> 02:29:43,360
我是美国人! 美国平民
I'm an American.Yeah. An American civilian.

1824
02:29:43,560 --> 02:29:44,860
嗨  美国佬

1825
02:29:45,070 --> 02:29:49,090
美国平民  没事了
Hi. American.American civilian. It's all right.

1826
02:29:49,300 --> 02:29:53,100
你有我梦寐以求的香烟
And you got the cigarettes. And that's what I've been dreaming about.

1827
02:29:53,310 --> 02:29:54,830
大厨
Chelf.

1828
02:29:55,040 --> 02:29:56,770
你是谁?
Who are you?

1829
02:29:56,980 --> 02:29:58,600
你又是谁?
Who are you?

1830
02:30:02,080 --> 02:30:03,640
我是个摄影记者
I'm a photojournalist.

1831
02:30:04,380 --> 02:30:06,510
我自64年起  就负责报道这场战争
I've covered the war since '64.

1832
02:30:06,750 --> 02:30:09,950
去过老挝  柬埔寨和越南
I've been in Laos, Cambodia and 'Nam.

1833
02:30:12,930 --> 02:30:17,450
老实说  这船一团糟
Hoo-wee, baby. I'll tell you one thing. This boat is a mess, man.

1834
02:30:17,700 --> 02:30:18,960
这些是什么人?
Who are all these people?

1835
02:30:19,200 --> 02:30:22,570
他们认为你是来
Yeah, well, they think you've come to--

1836
02:30:23,370 --> 02:30:26,360
带他走的  希望不是这样
to take him away.And I hope that isn't true.

1837
02:30:26,510 --> 02:30:27,630
带谁走?
Take who away?

1838
02:30:29,710 --> 02:30:33,080
他呀  库上校!
Him! Col. kurtz.

1839
02:30:33,410 --> 02:30:36,940
你能看见的  都是他的子民
These are all his children, man, as far as you can see.

1840
02:30:37,180 --> 02:30:40,710
这里的人全是他的子民
Hell, man, out here we're all his children.

1841
02:30:40,920 --> 02:30:44,520
我们能跟库上校谈谈吗?
Could we talk to Col. kurtz?

1842
02:30:44,730 --> 02:30:48,890
你不是跟上校谈
Hey, mac. You don't talk to the colonel.

1843
02:30:49,100 --> 02:30:50,860
而是听他说
Well, you listen to him.

1844
02:30:52,070 --> 02:30:54,230
他启发我们
The man's enlarged my mind.

1845
02:30:54,870 --> 02:30:58,170
在传统意义上  他是个诗人战土
He's a poet warrior in the classic sense.

1846
02:30:58,370 --> 02:31:01,100
就是说  有时他    你向他问好
I mean, sometimes he'll--Well, you say hello to him, right?

1847
02:31:01,310 --> 02:31:04,070
他会走过你身旁  却对你视若无睹
He'll just walk by you and he won't even notice you.

1848
02:31:04,310 --> 02:31:05,570
突然又会抓住你
Then suddenly he'll grab you

1849
02:31:05,810 --> 02:31:07,800
带到一个角落  说
and he'll throw you in a corner and he'll say...

1850
02:31:07,950 --> 02:31:09,970
你知不知道生命中充满假如?
''Do you know that 'if' is the middle word in 'life'?

1851
02:31:10,320 --> 02:31:11,580
假如所有的人都失去理智并指责你
If you can keep your head

1852
02:31:11,580 --> 02:31:12,840
而你仍保持清醒
when all about you are losing theirs and blaming you.

1853
02:31:12,950 --> 02:31:14,750
假如所有的人都怀疑你  而你仍能相信自己
If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you.''

1854
02:31:14,960 --> 02:31:18,580
我不能  我是小人物  他是个伟人
I'm a little man. I'm a little man. He's a great man.

1855
02:31:18,790 --> 02:31:22,320
我愿有一对锯齿状的爪
''I should have been a pair of ragged claws...

1856
02:31:22,530 --> 02:31:24,550
好划破沉默的海底
scuttling across floors of silent seas.''

1857
02:31:24,770 --> 02:31:26,730
-我是说  -留在船上
-I mean--  -Stay with the boat.

1858
02:31:26,970 --> 02:31:29,440
别丢下我  好吗?
Don't go any--Don't go without me, okay?

1859
02:31:29,600 --> 02:31:31,830
我要拍照
I wanna get a picture.

1860
02:31:33,270 --> 02:31:36,830
他有时很可怕  有时很普通
He can be terrible and he can be mean...

1861
02:31:37,040 --> 02:31:38,710
他可能是对的
and he can be right.

1862
02:31:38,910 --> 02:31:40,880
他在战斗
He's fiIghting the war.

1863
02:31:41,080 --> 02:31:43,050
他是个伟人
He's a great man.

1864
02:31:45,220 --> 02:31:46,850
我是说
I mean--

1865
02:31:49,820 --> 02:31:53,260
我希望能用语言来形容
I wish I had words, you know. I wish I had words.

1866
02:31:53,460 --> 02:31:56,490
我可以告诉你  前几天他想杀我
I could tell you something like, the other day he wanted to kill me.

1867
02:31:56,700 --> 02:31:57,720
诸如此类
Something like that.

1868
02:31:57,930 --> 02:31:59,420
他为什么想杀你?
Why'd he want to kill you?

1869
02:31:59,700 --> 02:32:01,860
因为我拍了他的照片
Because I took his picture.

1870
02:32:02,000 --> 02:32:05,030
他说  你要是再拍我
He said, ''If you take my picture again...

1871
02:32:05,710 --> 02:32:07,500
我就宰了你
I'm gonna kill you.''

1872
02:32:08,110 --> 02:32:10,130
他是认真的
And he meant it.

1873
02:32:11,980 --> 02:32:16,350
所以你得保持冷静  懂吗?
See, just lay cool. Lay cool.Lay back. Dig it.

1874
02:32:16,550 --> 02:32:19,040
他又友善了  确实如此
He gets friendly again. He really does.

1875
02:32:19,920 --> 02:32:23,220
但你无法猜度上校
But you don't--you don't--you don't judge the colonel.

1876
02:32:23,420 --> 02:32:26,290
你不能用正常人的尺度猜度他
You don't judge the colonel like an ordinary man.

1877
02:32:32,200 --> 02:32:35,730
好了  看着  这些是美国人! 美国人
Okay, watch it now. These are Americans. Americans!

1878
02:32:36,000 --> 02:32:38,270
好好感受这个地方
You can feel the vibe of this place.

1879
02:32:38,410 --> 02:32:39,530
让我给你拍照
Let me take your picture.

1880
02:32:39,740 --> 02:32:41,600
你能停  ?  嗨! 嗨!
Hey, could you hold--Hey, hello. Hello.

1881
02:32:41,810 --> 02:32:43,710
你能停一下吗?
Could you hold up a minute?

1882
02:33:05,770 --> 02:33:07,490
科比
Colby.

1883
02:33:23,320 --> 02:33:25,050
那些头
The heads.

1884
02:33:25,490 --> 02:33:27,390
你在看那些头
You're looking at the heads.

1885
02:33:29,160 --> 02:33:31,420
有时他做过了火
I, uh--Sometimes he goes too far.

1886
02:33:31,730 --> 02:33:34,060
会第一个站出来承认
He's the fiIrst one to admit it.

1887
02:33:34,490 --> 02:33:37,400
-他疯了  -不对!
-He's gone crazy.  -Wrong, wrong!

1888
02:33:38,770 --> 02:33:41,500
如果你早到两天
If you could have heard the man just two days ago--

1889
02:33:41,700 --> 02:33:44,260
听了他的讲话
if you could have heard him then, God--

1890
02:33:44,470 --> 02:33:47,800
-你还会说他疯了?  -绝对是
-You were gonna call him crazy?  -Fuckin' A!

1891
02:33:49,740 --> 02:33:51,840
我只想跟他谈谈
I just wanna talk to him.

1892
02:33:53,480 --> 02:33:56,040
嗯  他已经走了
Well, man, he's gone away.

1893
02:33:56,880 --> 02:33:58,230
他和部下一起
He's gone away.

1894
02:33:58,230 --> 02:33:59,580
消失在了丛林中
He disappeared out in the jungle with his people.

1895
02:33:59,750 --> 02:34:01,270
我会等他
I'll wait for him.

1896
02:34:01,270 --> 02:34:02,780
他和部下在一起  感觉自在
He feels comfortable with his people.

1897
02:34:02,990 --> 02:34:05,690
跟他们在一起  他忘了自己
He forgets himself with his people.

1898
02:34:07,160 --> 02:34:08,530
他忘了自己
He forgets himself.

1899
02:34:08,730 --> 02:34:09,890
上尉?
Captain?

1900
02:34:10,100 --> 02:34:12,390
也许我们该回船上等
Maybe we should wait back at the boat.

1901
02:34:13,070 --> 02:34:14,800
-我认为你  -好的  大厨
-I think you should-- -Okay, Chef.

1902
02:34:15,000 --> 02:34:16,870
我们要回船上一会
We'll go back to the boat for a while.

1903
02:34:17,070 --> 02:34:20,370
好的  陪着兰斯
Yeah, stay with Lance.

1904
02:34:42,430 --> 02:34:45,460
这上校是个疯子
This colonel guy, he's wacko, man.

1905
02:34:45,630 --> 02:34:48,160
比疯掉还糟  他是恶魔
He's worse than crazy. He's evil!

1906
02:34:48,370 --> 02:34:50,600
这就是他因之自命不凡的
I mean, that's what the man's got set up here, man!

1907
02:34:50,870 --> 02:34:52,600
该死的异教偶像崇拜! 看看四周
It's fuckin' pagan idolatry. Look around you!

1908
02:34:54,720 --> 02:34:57,590
-妈的  他是个疯子  -那你会帮我吗?
-Shit, he's loco.  -Then you'll help me?

1909
02:34:57,790 --> 02:34:59,430
帮忙? 当然  为了从这摊烂事中脱身
Fuckin' A, I'll help you.

1910
02:34:59,430 --> 02:35:01,060
我会做任何事
I'll do anything to get out of this joint.

1911
02:35:01,360 --> 02:35:02,630
好样的
Good boy.

1912
02:35:02,730 --> 02:35:04,290
我们可以把他们都炸上天
We could blow all them assholes away.

1913
02:35:04,530 --> 02:35:07,200
他们离得这么远  甚至不会觉察
They're so fuckin' spaced out, they wouldn't even know it.

1914
02:35:07,870 --> 02:35:10,670
我不怕他们那些
I ain't afraid of

1915
02:35:10,670 --> 02:35:13,470
头骨  祭坛之类的恶心东西
fuckin' skulls and altars and shit.

1916
02:35:14,510 --> 02:35:18,500
我一直认为  要是死在邪恶的地方
I used to think if I died in an evil place...

1917
02:35:18,680 --> 02:35:21,510
灵魂就无法入天堂
then my soul wouldn't be able to make it to Heaven.

1918
02:35:21,720 --> 02:35:25,810
但现在  操
But now, fuck--

1919
02:35:26,620 --> 02:35:29,720
我不管它去哪  只要别在这
I mean, I don't care where it goes, as long as it ain't here.

1920
02:35:29,930 --> 02:35:32,420
你想怎么办? 我要杀了那混蛋
So what do you wanna do? I'll kill the fuck.

1921
02:35:32,630 --> 02:35:34,290
滚开
Get out of here.

1922
02:35:34,560 --> 02:35:36,620
我要你等在这  大厨
I'm gonna need you to wait here, Chef.

1923
02:35:36,900 --> 02:35:39,230
我会和兰斯去四周转转
I'll go up with Lance and scrounge around,

1924
02:35:39,430 --> 02:35:40,900
查查这地方
check the place out.

1925
02:35:41,200 --> 02:35:44,330
看能否找到上校  行吗?
See if I can fiInd the colonel, okay?

1926
02:35:44,810 --> 02:35:46,570
你要我做什么?
Well, what do you want me to do?

1927
02:35:46,780 --> 02:35:51,140
守着无线电
Here. You take the radio...

1928
02:35:51,350 --> 02:35:54,910
若到22时我仍没回来
and if I don't get back by 2200 hours...

1929
02:35:57,120 --> 02:35:59,090
你就要求空袭
you call in the air strike.

1930
02:36:01,060 --> 02:36:02,850
空袭?
''Air strike?''

1931
02:36:04,330 --> 02:36:05,450
密码是  全能
The code is ''Almighty''...

1932
02:36:05,660 --> 02:36:09,360
坐标:  0-9-2-6-4-7-1-2
coordinates zero-niner-two-six-four-seven-one-two.

1933
02:36:10,130 --> 02:36:11,900
都在这里
It's all in there.

1934
02:36:12,730 --> 02:36:16,760
0-9-2-6-4-7-1-2
Zero-niner-two-six-four-seven-one-two.

1935
02:36:24,410 --> 02:36:28,440
我所见的都告诉我:  库尔兹已经疯了
Everything I saw told me that kurtz had gone insane.

1936
02:36:31,990 --> 02:36:34,010
这里尸骸遍地
The place was full of bodies--

1937
02:36:34,220 --> 02:36:39,090
北越人  越共  柬埔寨人
North Vietnamese, Vietcong, Cambodians.

1938
02:36:45,530 --> 02:36:49,490
若我还能活着  那是因为他不想我死
If I was still alive, it was because he wanted me that way.

1939
02:37:22,940 --> 02:37:26,340
死亡的气息渐渐逼近
It smelled like slow death in there--

1940
02:37:26,940 --> 02:37:31,040
疟疾  噩梦
malaria...and nightmares.

1941
02:37:33,010 --> 02:37:36,040
这是河的尽头
This was the end of the river, all right.

1942
02:37:49,300 --> 02:37:51,630
你从哪来  威尔德?
Where are you from, Willard?

1943
02:37:56,400 --> 02:37:58,870
俄亥俄  长官
I'm from Ohio, sir.

1944
02:38:03,950 --> 02:38:06,000
你在那出生的?

02:38:06,210 --> 02:38:08,080
是的  长官
Yes, sir.

1946
02:38:08,720 --> 02:38:10,690
哪个地区?
Whereabouts?

1947

托莱多  长官
Toledo, sir.

1948
02:38:18,830 --> 02:38:21,350
离河有多远?
How far are you from the river?

1949
02:38:27,500 --> 02:38:29,800
俄亥俄河吗  长官?
The Ohio River, sir?

1950
02:38:31,740 --> 02:38:34,040
2百多公里
About 200 miles.

1951
02:38:41,520 --> 02:38:44,880
我小时候到过那河一次
I went down that river once when I was a kid.

1952
02:38:49,260 --> 02:38:52,230
河上有个地方    我想不起来了
There's a place in the river--I can't remember--

1953
02:38:52,430 --> 02:38:54,980
曾有个栀子园
Must've been a gardenia plantation

1954
02:38:54,980 --> 02:38:57,520
或是花园
or a flower plantation at one time.

1955
02:38:57,730 --> 02:39:00,360
现在都荒了
It's all wild and overgrown now. But for about--

1956
02:39:00,600 --> 02:39:03,260
但有那么8公里长
for about fiIve miles you'd think that...

1957
02:39:03,440 --> 02:39:07,530
让你会以为天堂落入凡间
heaven just fell on the earth...

1958
02:39:08,310 --> 02:39:11,340
成了栀子园
in the form of gardenias.

1959
02:39:26,760 --> 02:39:28,750
你曾考虑过
Have you ever considered...

1960
02:39:30,370 --> 02:39:32,560
任何真正的自由吗?
any real freedoms?

1961
02:39:37,510 --> 02:39:41,440
不被他人意见左右的自由?
Freedoms from the opinion of others?

1962
02:39:43,950 --> 02:39:46,780
甚至不被自己的看法左右?
Even the opinions of yourself?

1963
02:40:02,060 --> 02:40:06,500
他们说过为什么  威尔德?
Did they say why, Willard?

1964
02:40:07,970 --> 02:40:13,530
为什么想终结我的指挥吗?
Why they wanted to terminate my command?

1965
02:40:28,220 --> 02:40:31,780
我的任务保密  长官
I was sent on a classifiIed mission, sir.

1966
02:40:34,730 --> 02:40:36,860
不再是秘密了
It's no longer classifiIed,

1967
02:40:37,670 --> 02:40:39,190
对吧?
is it?

1968
02:40:45,440 --> 02:40:47,430
他们对你说了什么?
What did they tell you?

1969
02:40:49,940 --> 02:40:54,040
他们告诉我你已经
They told me...that you had gone...

1970
02:40:54,980 --> 02:40:57,250
彻底疯了
totally insane...

1971
02:40:59,390 --> 02:41:05,850
你的行为反常
and that your methods were unsound.

1972
02:41:09,430 --> 02:41:12,090
我的方式反常吗?
Are my methods unsound?

1973
02:41:17,440 --> 02:41:21,670
我没看到任何
I don't see any method...

1974
02:41:22,810 --> 02:41:24,780
反常行为  长官
at all, sir.

1975
02:41:30,620 --> 02:41:35,390
我料到会有你这样的人来
I expected...someone like you.

1976
02:41:37,590 --> 02:41:39,690
你指望什么?
What did you expect?

1977
02:41:47,270 --> 02:41:49,200
你是个杀手吗?
Are you an assassin?

1978
02:41:53,780 --> 02:41:55,710
我是个战士
I'm a soldier.

1979
02:41:58,780 --> 02:42:00,680
你什么也不是
You're neither.

1980
02:42:02,380 --> 02:42:08,290
你是杂货店伙计派来
You're an errand boy  sent by grocery clerks...

1981
02:42:09,920 --> 02:42:13,830
收账的跑腿
to collect the bill.

1982
02:42:57,410 --> 02:42:59,400
为什么?
Why, huh?

1983
02:42:59,670 --> 02:43:04,200
为什么像你这样的聪明人  要杀一个天才?
Why would a nice guy like you wanna kill a genius?

1984
02:43:10,050 --> 02:43:11,780
觉得很过瘾吗?
Feeling pretty good, huh?

1985
02:43:12,550 --> 02:43:14,040
为什么?
Why?

1986
02:43:15,560 --> 02:43:16,990
知道吗?
Do you know--

1987
02:43:17,790 --> 02:43:19,890
你知不知道
Do you know that the man--

1988
02:43:23,160 --> 02:43:26,000
他确实喜欢你?
the man really likes you?

1989
02:43:28,570 --> 02:43:31,100
他喜欢你  真的
He likes you. He really likes you.

1990
02:43:33,070 --> 02:43:35,800
但他有些心里话要对你说
But he's got something in mind for you.

1991
02:43:36,040 --> 02:43:37,480
你不好奇吗?
Aren't you curious about that?

1992
02:43:38,280 --> 02:43:40,270
我好奇
I'm curious.

1993
02:43:40,550 --> 02:43:42,950
非常好奇
I'm very curious.

1994
02:43:43,080 --> 02:43:44,710
你好奇吗?
Are you curious?

1995

这里有事发生
There's something happening out here, man.

你知道  有些事你没我清楚
You know something, man. I know something that you don't know.

1997
02:43:56,500 --> 02:43:57,930
没错  杰克
That's right,Jack.

1998
02:43:58,130 --> 02:44:01,590
他心里雪亮
The man is clear in his mind...

1999
02:44:01,800 --> 02:44:04,000
但灵魂发了疯
but his soul is mad.

2000
02:44:05,470 --> 02:44:06,940
没错
Oh, yeah.

2001
02:44:07,910 --> 02:44:09,670
我认为他快死了
He's dying, I think.

2002
02:44:09,880 --> 02:44:12,940
他讨厌这一切
He hates all this. He hates it.

2003
02:44:13,150 --> 02:44:17,050
但他
But the man's--

2004
02:44:20,360 --> 02:44:23,520
他大声读诗  对吗?
He reads poetry out loud, all right?

2005
02:44:24,730 --> 02:44:26,690
那声音
And a voice--

2006
02:44:27,760 --> 02:44:29,530
声音
a voice--

02:44:31,770 --> 02:44:34,560
他喜欢你  因为你还活着
He likes you 'cause you're still alive.

2008
02:44:34,770 --> 02:44:36,330
他对你做了安排
He's got plans for you.

2009
02:44:36,570 --> 02:44:42,010
不  我不会帮你  你要帮他
No, no, I'm not gonna help you.You're gonna help him, man.

你要帮他
You're gonna help him.

2011
02:44:43,810 --> 02:44:46,410
我是说  若他死了  他们会怎么说?
I mean, what are they gonna say, man, when he's gone, huh?

2012
02:44:46,610 --> 02:44:50,980
因为他和它是生死相连的
'Cause he dies when it dies, man. When it dies, he dies.

2013
02:44:51,190 --> 02:44:52,620
他们会怎么说他?
What are they gonna say about him? What are they gonna say?

2014
02:44:53,030 --> 02:44:54,880
会说他仁慈?
He was a kind man?

2015
02:44:55,120 --> 02:44:58,790
英明? 他有谋略? 有智慧?
He was a wise man? He had plans? He had wisdom?

2016
02:44:59,090 --> 02:45:00,750
胡扯
Bullshit, man!

2017
02:45:00,860 --> 02:45:03,730
我会是那个  让他们醒悟的人吗?

《地平线上的战斗》
''The War on the Horizon.

2035
02:49:54,440 --> 02:49:56,530
美国人民或许很难相信
The American people may fiInd it hard to believe...

2036
02:49:56,640 --> 02:49:59,160
美国正在赢得越战
that the US is winning the war in Vietnam.

2037
02:50:00,110 --> 02:50:01,940
然而
Nevertheless...

2038
02:50:02,140 --> 02:50:04,300
一份对目前战争态势最详尽的
one of the most exhaustive inquiries...

2039
02:50:04,510 --> 02:50:07,280
经过整理的调查
into the status of the conflict yet compiled...

2040
02:50:07,480 --> 02:50:10,470
提供了足够的证据  表明美国当局
offers considerable evidence that the weight of US power...

2041
02:50:10,690 --> 02:50:13,350
在大举进攻后的两年半
two-and-a-half years after the big buildup began...

2042
02:50:13,920 --> 02:50:16,390
开始感受到了自身的强大
is beginning to make itself felt.

2043
02:50:16,560 --> 02:50:21,690
白宫官员坚称  由此带来的影响
White House offiIcials maintain the impact of that strength...

2044
02:50:21,900 --> 02:50:24,960
可能令敌方
may bring the enemy to the point where he could...

2045
02:50:25,170 --> 02:50:29,100
无法继续抵抗
simply be unable to continue fiIghting.''

2046
02:50:30,410 --> 02:50:31,430
熟悉吧?
Is this familiar?

2047
02:50:33,340 --> 02:50:36,310
由于约翰逊总统  担心美国公众
''Because Lyndon Johnson fears that the US public...

2048
02:50:36,540 --> 02:50:40,380
无法接受这一乐观结论
is in no mood to accept its optimistic conclusions...

2049
02:50:40,620 --> 02:50:43,110
可能不会允许  报告在秋季发布
he may never permit the report to be released in full.

2050
02:50:43,270 --> 02:50:46,700
即便如此  他仍对结论印象深刻
Even so, he is suffiIciently impressed with the fiIndings...

2051
02:50:46,910 --> 02:50:50,140
并迫切想公开  他们的研究结果
and suffiIciently anxious to make their conclusions known...

2052
02:50:50,340 --> 02:50:53,240
以便这方面的专家
to permit experts who have been working on it...

2053
02:50:53,440 --> 02:50:55,500
能泛泛的谈论它
to talk about it in general terms.''

罗伯特汤普森爵士
''Sir Robert Thompson...

2056
02:51:16,330 --> 02:51:19,460
曾在马来半岛  击败共产党游击队
who led the victory over Communist guerillas in Malaya...

2057
02:51:19,700 --> 02:51:22,430
他现在是  兰德公司(美军智库)的顾问
is now a RAND corporation consultant...

2058
02:51:22,710 --> 02:51:25,320
最近回到越南
recently returned to Vietnam

2059
02:51:25,320 --> 02:51:27,940
向尼克松总统报告形势
to sound out the situation for President Nixon.

2060
02:51:28,050 --> 02:51:29,540
上周  他告诉总统
He told the president last week...

2061
02:51:29,750 --> 02:51:32,610
情况大有好转
that things felt much better...

2062
02:51:32,820 --> 02:51:36,840
以后会更好
and smelled much better over there.''

2063
02:51:37,740 --> 02:51:39,800
你怎么想  大兵?
How do they smell to you, soldier?

2064
02:51:52,020 --> 02:51:54,960
你会自由  会有人看管你
You'll be free. You'll be under guard.

2065
02:51:55,620 --> 02:51:57,990
闲暇时读读这些
Read these at your leisure.

2066
02:51:58,190 --> 02:51:59,720
别弄丢了
Don't lose them.

2067
02:51:59,930 --> 02:52:03,060
别想逃  会打死你
Don't try to escape. You'll be shot.

2068
02:52:03,970 --> 02:52:06,760
我们回头可以谈谈这些
We can talk of these things later.

2069
02:55:24,660 --> 02:55:27,830
我们是空心人
''We are the hollow men.

2070
02:55:28,030 --> 02:55:29,860
我们是稻草人
We are the stuffed men...

2071
02:55:30,070 --> 02:55:34,440
依靠在一起  脑壳中装满了稻草
leaning together at peace fiIlled with straw.

2072
02:55:37,080 --> 02:55:38,210
我们干巴的嗓音
Alas, our dried voices

2073
02:55:38,210 --> 02:55:39,340
当我们在一块儿窃窃低语时
when we whisper together...

2074
02:55:39,550 --> 02:55:41,100
寂静又毫无意义
are quiet and meaningless as wind in dry grass...

2075
02:55:41,310 --> 02:55:44,040
好似干草地上的风
or a rat's feet over broken glass in a dry cellar.

2076
02:55:44,250 --> 02:55:46,740
或我们干燥的地窖中
He's really out there.

2077
02:55:48,620 --> 02:55:49,880
他真在那
He is really there.

2078
02:55:50,090 --> 02:55:52,680
成形却没有形式
Shape without form...

2079
02:55:53,390 --> 02:55:55,020
成影却没有颜色
shade without color...

2080
02:55:55,960 --> 02:55:58,190
力量瘫痪
paralyzed force...

2081
02:55:59,100 --> 02:56:00,760
有姿势却无动作
gesture without motion.''

2082
02:56:00,900 --> 02:56:03,300
你知道他在说什么吗?
Do you know what the man's saying?

2083
02:56:03,700 --> 02:56:05,190
知道吗?
Do you?

2084
02:56:05,970 --> 02:56:07,390
这是辩证法
This is dialectics.

2085
02:56:07,390 --> 02:56:08,800
非常简单的辩证法
It's very simple dialectics.

2086
02:56:09,010 --> 02:56:10,770
就像从1到9  没有或许
It's one through nine. No maybes,

2087
02:56:10,770 --> 02:56:12,530
没有假设  没有分数
no supposes, no fractions.

2088
02:56:12,780 --> 02:56:14,060
你不能在太空漫游
You can't travel in space.

2089
02:56:14,060 --> 02:56:15,340
你不能进入太空
You can't go out into space, you know...

2090
02:56:15,510 --> 02:56:18,040
要是没有分数的话
without like, you know, with fractions.

2091
02:56:18,280 --> 02:56:20,510
你要在哪着陆?  1/4? 3/8?
What are you gonna land on? One-quarter? Three-eighths?

2092
02:56:20,790 --> 02:56:22,910
若从这去金星  你要做什么?
What are you gonna do when you go from here to Venus?

2093
02:56:23,060 --> 02:56:24,820
这是辩证物理学  对吗?
That's dialectic physics, okay.

2094
02:56:25,020 --> 02:56:27,010
辩证逻辑认为非爱即恨
Dialectic logic is, there's only love and hate.

2095
02:56:27,290 --> 02:56:29,490
你要么爱人  要么恨人
You either love somebody or you hate 'em.

2096
02:56:30,030 --> 02:56:31,860
蠢货!
Mutt!

2097
02:56:33,200 --> 02:56:34,790
你这蠢货
You mutt.

2098
02:56:35,070 --> 02:56:38,230
这就是这该死的世界  结束的方式
This is the way the fucking world is.

2099
02:56:38,400 --> 02:56:40,770
看看我们这鬼地方
Look at this fucking shit we're in, man!

2100
02:56:40,940 --> 02:56:42,700
并非一声巨响  而是一阵呜咽
Not with a bang. A whimper.

2101
02:56:42,910 --> 02:56:44,760
伴随这阵呜咽
And with a whimper,

2102
02:56:44,760 --> 02:56:46,610
我他妈闪了  杰克
I'm fucking splitting,Jack.

2103
02:57:15,270 --> 02:57:16,590
在河上
On the river,

2104
02:57:16,590 --> 02:57:17,900
在那一刻  我看着他
I thought that the minute I looked at him...

2105
02:57:18,040 --> 02:57:19,910
我会知道要做什么
I'd know what to do.

2106
02:57:20,780 --> 02:57:23,110
结果并非如此
But it didn't happen.

2107
02:57:23,980 --> 02:57:26,420
我和他在一起好几天
I was in there with him for days.

2108
02:57:26,620 --> 02:57:28,140
没有守卫
Not under guard.

2109
02:57:28,350 --> 02:57:30,480
我是自由的
I was free.

2110
02:57:30,720 --> 02:57:33,780
但他知道我哪也不会去
But he knew I wasn't going anywhere.

2111
02:57:33,960 --> 02:57:37,660
我要做什么  他比我还清楚
He knew more about what I was going to do than I did.

2112
02:57:44,640 --> 02:57:48,870
若老川的将军们  看见这一情景
If the generals backin Nha Trang could see what I saw...

2113
02:57:48,970 --> 02:57:51,810
仍想让我杀了他吗?
would they still want me to kill him?

2114
02:57:53,010 --> 02:57:55,450
或许更为急切
More than ever, probably.

2115
02:57:56,010 --> 02:57:57,380
若他的家人知道
And what would his people back home want

2116
02:57:57,380 --> 02:57:58,740
他已经离他们有多遥远时
if they ever learned...

2117
02:57:58,950 --> 02:58:02,180
他们会怎么想?
just how far from them he'd really gone?

2118
02:58:03,720 --> 02:58:04,950
他跟他们决裂了
He broke from them...

2119
02:58:05,720 --> 02:58:08,490
然后  跟自己也决裂了
and then he broke from himself.

2120
02:58:08,790 --> 02:58:11,850
我从没见一个人  被如此的隔绝
I'd never seen a man so broken up and...

2121
02:58:12,060 --> 02:58:13,760
和撕裂
ripped apart.

2122
02:58:14,030 --> 02:58:16,400
我看见了恐怖
I've seen the horrors--

2123
02:58:16,840 --> 02:58:19,300
你见过的恐怖
horrors that you've seen.

2124
02:58:20,870 --> 02:58:22,970
你无权称我是凶手
But you have no right to call me a murderer.

2125
02:58:23,080 --> 02:58:25,600
你有权杀我
You have a right to kill me.

2126
02:58:26,140 --> 02:58:29,600
你有这个权力
You have a right to do that.

2127
02:58:30,250 --> 02:58:33,270
但你无权审判我
But you have no right to judge me.

2128
02:58:39,260 --> 02:58:41,690
对于那些
It's impossible for words...

2129
02:58:43,160 --> 02:58:45,600
不知道什么叫恐怖的人
to describe...

2130
02:58:45,600 --> 02:58:50,600
来说
what is necessary

2131
02:58:52,140 --> 02:58:54,200
无法用语言
to those

2132
02:58:54,640 --> 02:58:57,130
向他们描述
who do not know

2133
02:58:57,240 --> 02:59:01,300
什么是必需的
what horror means.

2134
02:59:02,410 --> 02:59:04,310
恐怖
Horror.

2135
02:59:06,720 --> 02:59:10,380
恐怖有张面孔
Horror has a face.

2136
02:59:11,720 --> 02:59:14,820
你必须与之结交
And you must make a friend of horror.

2137
02:59:15,330 --> 02:59:19,060
恐怖与道德恐怖
Horror and moral terror...

2138
02:59:19,260 --> 02:59:20,630
应是你的朋友
are your friends.

2139
02:59:20,830 --> 02:59:23,060
如果不是
If they are not...

2140
02:59:23,270 --> 02:59:26,830
那他们便是  你应惧怕的敌人
then they are enemies to be feared.

2141
02:59:27,170 --> 02:59:29,540
他们是真正的敌人
They are truly enemies.

2142
02:59:34,110 --> 02:59:38,050
我记得在特种部队的日子
I remember when I was with Special Forces.

2143
02:59:41,490 --> 02:59:46,120
似乎是千百年前的事了
Seems a thousand centuries ago.

2144
02:59:48,930 --> 02:59:52,090
我们进了一个营地
We went into a camp to inoculate...

2145
02:59:53,930 --> 02:59:55,960
给一些孩子打预防针
some children.

2146
02:59:59,400 --> 03:00:01,840
替他们注射完  预防小儿麻痹的疫苗后
We'd left the camp...

2147
03:00:02,210 --> 03:00:06,200
我们离开了营地
after we had inoculated the children for polio.

2148
03:00:07,350 --> 03:00:08,610
这个老人
And this old man came running after us,

2149
03:00:08,610 --> 03:00:09,870
在我们后面边跑边哭
and he was crying.

2150
03:00:10,020 --> 03:00:12,040
他看不见
He couldn't say.

2151
03:00:14,350 --> 03:00:16,450
我们回去时
We went back there...

2152
03:00:16,660 --> 03:00:20,250
他们已经来过了  砍掉了
and they had come and hacked off...

2153
03:00:20,460 --> 03:00:23,330
所有接种过的手臂
every inoculated arm.

2154
03:00:24,660 --> 03:00:26,860
它们堆成了一堆
There they were, in a pile--

2155
03:00:27,070 --> 03:00:29,160
一堆
a pile of...

2156
03:00:30,470 --> 03:00:32,870
小小的手臂
little arms.

2157
03:00:33,710 --> 03:00:37,300
我记得
And I remember...

2158
03:00:37,980 --> 03:00:43,880
我哭了  像一些老大娘般
I-I--I cried.I wept like...

2159
03:00:44,650 --> 03:00:47,910
抹眼泪
some grandmother.

2160
03:00:49,590 --> 03:00:51,870
我咬牙切齿
I wanted to tear my teeth out.

2161
03:00:51,870 --> 03:00:54,150
不知道自己想干什么
I didn't know what I wanted to do.

2162
03:00:54,660 --> 03:00:57,690
我要记着这一幕  永不忘记
And I want to remember it. I never want to forget it.

2163
03:00:57,900 --> 03:01:00,460
永不忘记
I never want to forget.

2164
03:01:01,270 --> 03:01:03,890
然后我顿悟
And then I realized...

2165
03:01:04,540 --> 03:01:06,300
如同中弹
like I was shot--

2166
03:01:06,400 --> 03:01:09,600
如同一颗钻石般  坚硬的子弹
like I was shot with a diamond--

2167
03:01:09,880 --> 03:01:14,070
正中我的前额
a diamond bullet right through my forehead.

2168
03:01:15,050 --> 03:01:18,850
于是我想  天哪  真是天才
And I thought, ''My God, the genius of that.

2169
03:01:19,050 --> 03:01:21,450
天才
The genius.''

2170
03:01:21,650 --> 03:01:25,110
这么干的决心
The will to do that.

2171
03:01:25,790 --> 03:01:31,630
完美  真实 彻底 清晰 纯粹
Perfect, genuine, complete, crystalline, pure.

2172
03:01:32,830 --> 03:01:34,360
然后  我明白了
And then I realized...

2173
03:01:34,570 --> 03:01:38,370
他们比我强悍  因为他们受得了
they were stronger than me because they could stand it.

2174
03:01:38,570 --> 03:01:41,040
这些人并非怪物  他们是人
These were not monsters. These were men--

2175
03:01:41,240 --> 03:01:43,070
受过训练的骨干
trained cadres.

2176
03:01:43,880 --> 03:01:46,370
他们用心作战
These men who fought with their hearts...

2177
03:01:46,580 --> 03:01:48,510
他们有家庭  子女
who have families, who have children...

2178
03:01:48,710 --> 03:01:50,610
心中充满了爱
who are fiIlled with love...

2179
03:01:50,820 --> 03:01:53,810
但他们有力量
that they had the strength--

2180
03:01:54,220 --> 03:01:56,810
有这样做的
the strength...

2181
03:01:59,760 --> 03:02:01,620
力量
to do that.

2182
03:02:01,830 --> 03:02:06,960
若我有十师的这号人马
If I had ten divisions of those men...

2183
03:02:07,170 --> 03:02:11,230
这里的麻烦很快便会摆平
then our troubles here would be over very quickly.

2184
03:02:12,000 --> 03:02:14,400
你的部下必须
You have to have men...

2185
03:02:15,510 --> 03:02:17,700
有道德观
who are moral...

2186
03:02:18,640 --> 03:02:23,210
同时也能
and at the same time...

2187
03:02:24,250 --> 03:02:26,980
利用他们的
who are able to...

2188
03:02:28,520 --> 03:02:31,820
原始本能去杀人
utilize their primordial instincts to kill...

2189
03:02:32,460 --> 03:02:35,790
不带感情  不会激动
without feeling, without passion...

2190
03:02:36,630 --> 03:02:40,220
不去判断是非
without judgment--without judgment.

2191
03:02:44,540 --> 03:02:48,230
因为正是判断令我们落败
Because it's judgment that defeats us.

2192
03:03:06,690 --> 03:03:09,720
我担心我儿子
I worry that my son...

2193
03:03:09,930 --> 03:03:14,870
也许不明白我的用意
might not understand what I've tried to be.

2194
03:03:16,230 --> 03:03:21,500
若我被杀  威尔德
And if I were to be killed, Willard...

2195
03:03:22,570 --> 03:03:25,440
我希望有人去我家
I would want someone to go to my home...

2196
03:03:25,580 --> 03:03:29,270
告诉我儿子这一切
and tell my son everything.

2197
03:03:31,180 --> 03:03:35,140
我所做的和你看到的一切
Everything I did. Everything you saw.

2198
03:03:35,790 --> 03:03:39,190
因为最令我厌恶的
Because there's nothing that I detest more than...

2199
03:03:39,420 --> 03:03:42,790
莫过于谎言的恶臭了
the stench of lies.

2200
03:03:44,530 --> 03:03:47,930
如果你理解我  威尔德
And if you understand me, Willard, you--

2201
03:03:49,530 --> 03:03:52,330
你会为我作这件事的
you will do this for me.

2202
03:04:58,000 --> 03:05:00,400
街霸  这是  全能  完毕
PBRStreet Gang, this is Almighty. Over.

2203
03:05:01,970 --> 03:05:05,430
街霸    全能  已就绪  完毕
PBRStreet Gang, this is Almighty standing by. Over.

2204
03:05:07,350 --> 03:05:09,460
街霸  全能已就绪
PBRStreet Gang, this is Almighty standing by.

2205
03:05:09,460 --> 03:05:11,580
听到了吗?
How do you copy?

2206
03:05:16,620 --> 03:05:19,350
他们会因此升我为少校
They were gonna make me a major for this...

2207
03:05:20,160 --> 03:05:23,460
而我甚至不在  他们的狗屁军队里了
and I wasn't even in their fuckin'army anymore.

2208
03:05:25,460 --> 03:05:28,400
人人都希望我下手
Everybody wanted me to do it.

2209
03:05:29,030 --> 03:05:31,470
最渴望的是他
Him most of all.

2210
03:05:32,140 --> 03:05:34,330
我觉得他似乎就在那
I felt like he was up there...

2211
03:05:34,540 --> 03:05:37,840
等着我去解除痛苦
waiting for me to take the pain away.

2212
03:05:39,840 --> 03:05:42,400
他只想死得像个军人
He just wanted to go out like a soldier...

2213
03:05:43,050 --> 03:05:45,110
站立着
standing up.

2214
03:05:45,320 --> 03:05:50,020
不像那些  可怜的  被遗弃的叛徒
Not like some poor, wasted, rag-assed renegade.

2215
03:05:52,720 --> 03:05:55,850
连丛林也想让他死
Even the jungle wanted him dead.

2216
03:05:56,060 --> 03:05:59,190
而他正是听命于它
And that's who he really took his orders from anyway.

2217
03:07:15,970 --> 03:07:18,810
我们训练年轻人轰炸别人
We train young men to drop fiIre on people...

2218
03:07:19,910 --> 03:07:21,880
但他们的指挥官
but their commanders...

2219
03:07:22,610 --> 03:07:25,980
却不准他们在飞机上
won't allow them to write ''fuck''...

2220
03:07:26,250 --> 03:07:27,280
写  操
on their airplanes

2221
03:07:27,450 --> 03:07:29,150
因为这
because...

2222
03:07:29,350 --> 03:07:31,620
下流!
it's obscene.

2223
03:08:53,910 --> 03:08:56,270
恐怖
The horror.

2224
03:08:59,580 --> 03:09:00,910
恐怖
The horror.

2225
03:14:23,600 --> 03:14:25,660
呼叫街霸
Calling PBRStreet Gang.

2226
03:14:26,600 --> 03:14:28,150
街霸  我是  全能
PBRStreet Gang, this is Almighty.

2227
03:14:28,150 --> 03:14:29,700
听到了吗? 完毕
Do you read me? Over.

2228
03:14:31,410 --> 03:14:33,470
街霸?
PBRStreet Gang?

2229
03:14:33,680 --> 03:14:36,880
街霸  我是  全能
PBRStreet Gang, this is Almighty--

2230
03:15:14,120 --> 03:15:16,450
恐怖
The horror.

2231
03:15:19,820 --> 03:15:22,190
恐怖
The horror.
