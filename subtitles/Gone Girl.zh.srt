00:12:17,060 --> 00:12:18,850
我十岁时放弃学大提琴

但他们有时候真的挺混蛋的

229
00:12:50,470 --> 00:12:54,900
你去跟几个记者还有博主说两句
It would mean so much if you would talk to a few reporters, bloggers,

230
00:12:54,950 --> 00:12:56,220
给他们点小艾米的料
give them a little Amy color.

231

236
00:13:06,700 --> 00:13:09,330
你父母完全就是剽窃了你的童年
Your parents literally plagiarized your childhood.

237
00:13:09,370 --> 00:13:13,420
不  他们升华了它  然后兜售给读者
No, they improved upon it, and then peddled it to the masses.

238
00:13:13,450 --> 00:13:15,660
我以为你会穿白衣服来贴合婚礼主题
I thought you were gonna wear white to match the wedding theme.

239
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:17,170
我觉得会很怪
I thought that would be creepy.

240
00:13:17,210 --> 00:13:19,670
"要是值得去做  那就值得..."
"If it's worth doing, it's worth doing..."

241
00:13:19,710 --> 00:13:22,040
等等  我知道最后怎么说的  别告诉我
Hold up! I know how this ends. Don't tell me.

242

艾米  你知道该怎么让你爸爸开心
Amy, you know what would make dad's night.

244
00:13:25,590 --> 00:13:27,210
马上去
I'm on it.

245
00:13:28,510 --> 00:13:31,510
我最喜欢陌生人来揭我伤疤
I love having strangers pick at my scabs.

246

我很好奇
I'm curious whether

247
00:13:32,850 --> 00:13:34,560
你看到了不起的艾米走上红毯会不会难过
it's difficult for you to see amazing Amy heading down the aisle.

248
00:13:35,180 --> 00:13:38,020
还有这个庆祝这场虚拟婚礼的盛大派对
And this big party celebrating this fictional wedding.

249
00:13:38,060 --> 00:13:40,390
因为据我所知  你还未婚
Because it's my understanding you are not married.

250
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:42,110
是真的吗
Is that correct?

251
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:46,830
没错  了不起的艾米总是先我一步
Correct. Amazing Amy has always been one step ahead of me.

252
00:13:46,860 --> 00:13:50,690
抱歉  对不起  我有几个问题
Excuse me. I'm sorry, I just have a few questions.

253
00:13:51,080 --> 00:13:52,000
是你啊
It's you.

254
00:13:52,030 --> 00:13:54,570
我是秉着严谨的新闻态度来问的
I'm here in a strictly journalistic capacity.

255
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:56,100
现在你跟尼克·邓恩
Now, you had the distinct pleasure

256
00:13:56,100 --> 00:13:58,200
愉快地交往了多久了
of dating Nick Dunne for how long?

257
00:13:58,250 --> 00:14:01,050
-美妙的两年  -美妙的两年啊
- Two magical years. - Two magical years.

258
00:14:01,090 --> 00:14:02,930
在这段时间里  你非常体贴
In the course of that time, you've had the opportunity

259
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:05,420
比如尼克把"藜麦"说成"梨买"
to perform such gracious gestures as

260
00:14:05,460 --> 00:14:09,380
你也不去纠正他
not correcting Nick when he pronounced "Quinoa" as "Kween-o-a."

261
00:14:09,430 --> 00:14:10,890
可以理解的错误
An understandable mistake.

262
00:14:10,930 --> 00:14:12,130
他以为藜麦是种鱼
He also thought it was a fish.

263
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:13,730
他还以为美式软奶酪是奶酪
He thinks Velveeta is a cheese.

264
00:14:14,770 --> 00:14:17,060
尼克年迈的母亲每次见到你
You also manage to appear shocked and delighted

265
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:19,680
都会即兴表演《纽约纽约》时
when Nick's elderly mother breaks into an impromptu rendition
电影《纽约纽约》主题曲  后成为纽约市代表曲  许多纽约的社交场合都可听到

266
00:14:19,730 --> 00:14:21,940
你每次都能表现得很惊喜
Of New York, New York, every time she sees you.

267
00:14:21,980 --> 00:14:24,020
这些破鞋子
These vegabond shoes.

268
00:14:24,070 --> 00:14:25,240
别吓人了
That's just frightening.

269
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:27,910
你还给尼克买了他人生中第一把剪刀
You also bought Nick his very first pair of scissors.

270
00:14:27,950 --> 00:14:29,620
还有配套的订书机

271
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:32,580
艾米 艾略特  你不单是了不起
Amy Elliott, you are more than amazing.

272
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:36,130
你才华横溢还不矫揉造作

273
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,790
你让我充满挑战  充满惊喜
You challenge me. You surprise me.

274
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:41,160
还有给读者爆点料
And, fun fact for the readers,

275
00:14:41,580 --> 00:14:43,290
你床上功夫世界一流
you have a world-class vagina.

276
00:14:46,090 --> 00:14:48,430
我的同僚们告诉我你还未婚
My colleagues tell me that you are not yet married.

277
00:14:48,970 --> 00:14:50,760
是否正确
Is that correct?

278
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,260
我是未婚
I'm not.

279
00:14:52,300 --> 00:14:53,630
我们是不是该解决下这个问题了
Isn't it time we fixed that?

280
00:14:55,100 --> 00:14:56,770
然后
And then...

281
00:14:56,810 --> 00:14:59,650
那晚便不再糟糕了
the night wasn't so bad anymore.

282
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:18,490
好了  这事算完成了
And it's done. Crossed off the list.

283
00:15:18,540 --> 00:15:19,960
这种案子我们一般来说
Now, normally, we would not

284
00:15:19,960 --> 00:15:22,500
不会马上以失踪案处理
treat this as a missing persons case so quick,

285
00:15:22,540 --> 00:15:23,980
但鉴于你屋子里的情况
but given the scene at your house,

286
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,120
还有最近激增的暴力犯罪事件
and given our spike in violent crime of late,

287
00:15:26,170 --> 00:15:28,630
我们会严肃处理这起案件
We are gonna take this very, very seriously.

288
00:15:28,670 --> 00:15:29,670
好的  很好
Okay. Good.

我们派了鉴定科的人去你家

-我可以住我姐姐那  -好
- I could stay at my sister's. - Okay.

292
00:15:34,640 --> 00:15:36,940
我们会追踪艾米的手机  信用卡
We're tracking Amy's phone, her credit cards.

293
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:38,640
还会组织搜索  张贴传单
We will organize searches, put up flyers.

294
00:15:38,680 --> 00:15:40,400
明天就开新闻发布会
We're gonna hold a press conference tomorrow.

295
00:15:40,400 --> 00:15:41,680
你们要开新闻发布会吗
You're having a press conference?

296
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:43,320
引起大家重视
I wanna get the word out, right?

297
00:15:43,350 --> 00:15:45,230
是啊  只是突然感觉
Yeah, it's just all of a sudden,

298
00:15:45,240 --> 00:15:47,640
自己好像在演《法律与秩序》
I feel like I'm on a Law & Order episode.
美国电视史上播映时间最长犯罪剧集

299
00:15:54,700 --> 00:15:57,870
此类案件时间都很紧迫
Now, time is of the essence in these cases.

300
00:15:57,910 --> 00:16:00,660
但话说回来  你想找律师吗
But, that said, do you wanna wait and call a lawyer?

301
00:16:00,710 --> 00:16:01,840
完全不用  我想帮忙
Absolutely not. I just wanna help.

302
00:16:01,870 --> 00:16:03,660
你和艾米来这两年了
So, you and Amy have been here two years.

303

00:16:10,550 --> 00:16:12,350
-没有孩子  -还没有
- No kids? - Not yet.

306
00:16:12,380 --> 00:16:13,840
那艾米通常都做什么
So, what does Amy do most days?

307
00:16:13,890 --> 00:16:16,100
有那么多学位  她都做些什么
A woman with all those degrees, what does she do?

308
00:16:16,600 --> 00:16:18,020
我也不知道  她一直都挺忙的
I don't know. She keeps busy.

309
00:16:18,060 --> 00:16:19,560
忙什么
Doing what?

310
00:16:20,070 --> 00:16:23,090
其实  她特别爱读书
Yeah, I mean, She's a voracious reader.

311
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:26,280
所以她手里随时都拿着一本书
So, she's always got a book in her hand.

312
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:28,820
不过  长日漫漫
Well, days can get long.

313
00:16:28,860 --> 00:16:30,120
我认识几个家庭主妇
I know a few housewives,

314
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:32,700
中午就开始喝红酒了
that evening glass of wine starts coming at noon.

315
00:16:32,740 --> 00:16:34,030
有的是吃处方药
Or prescription pills.

316
00:16:34,070 --> 00:16:34,100
就在上周  有一位足球妈妈
Just last week, we had a soccer mom.

全职顾家支持孩子学习生活的母亲

Just last week, we had a soccer mom.

318
00:16:35,620 --> 00:16:36,000
人很好
Nice lady.

319
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:38,080
因为吃奥施康定[止痛药]出事掉了几颗牙
Got her teeth kicked in over some oxycontin.

320
00:16:38,120 --> 00:16:40,210
自从那间商场倒闭  半个城的人都失业了
Ever since that mall went bust, half the town is out of work.

321
00:16:40,240 --> 00:16:41,740
毒品暴力的问题我们实在处理不过来
We cannot keep up with the drug violence.

322
00:16:41,790 --> 00:16:44,210
我保证  不是毒品暴力的问题
I'm pretty sure that's not it.

323
00:16:44,250 --> 00:16:46,090
艾米有没有什么朋友可以跟我们谈一谈
Has Amy got friends we can talk to?

324
00:16:48,090 --> 00:16:49,380
没  没有
No, not really.

325
00:16:49,420 --> 00:16:51,380
这么大的地方  连一个朋友都没有
No friends? This whole town?

326
00:16:51,420 --> 00:16:55,050
我妈去世以前  她和我妈的关系很好
She was very close with my mom, before she passed away.

327
00:16:55,090 --> 00:16:57,210
我们小区那一带的流浪汉
You know, we have a pretty serious homeless problem.

328
00:16:57,260 --> 00:16:58,380
很是问题的
In our neighborhood.

329
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:00,480
我觉得你们应该查查这个
I think maybe you guys should check that out.

330
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:02,770
我们会调查的
We'll look into that.

331
00:17:02,810 --> 00:17:05,440
你今天十一点左右到酒吧
So, you got to the bar around 11:00 today.

332
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:07,070
那之前你在哪儿  正常排查而已
Where were you before that? Just to cross that out.

333
00:17:07,100 --> 00:17:08,100
早上我在家
Well, I was home.

334
00:17:08,100 --> 00:17:10,740
九点半出门  买了杯咖啡跟报纸
I left at 9:30, I got a cup of coffee, a newspaper.

335
00:17:10,780 --> 00:17:12,410
到索耶海滩看了会儿报纸
I went to Sawyer beach and read the news.

336
00:17:12,440 --> 00:17:14,610
你在那有碰见谁吗
Did you visit with anyone there?

337
00:17:14,650 --> 00:17:16,610
我就图那里没人打扰
I kind of go to Sawyer beach for the solitude.

338
00:17:17,780 --> 00:17:20,360
所以说  你妻子在这里没有朋友
So, your wife has no friends here.

339
00:17:20,410 --> 00:17:22,250
那她是不是比较冷漠呢
Is she kinda standoffish?

340
00:17:22,290 --> 00:17:24,710
读了名校  心高气傲什么的
Ivy league? Rubs people the wrong way?

341
00:17:24,750 --> 00:17:26,250
她是纽约来的
She's from New York.

342
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:30,760
她比较复杂  生活标准很高
She's complicated. She's got very high standards.

343
00:17:30,800 --> 00:17:31,800
A型人格
Type A?

344
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:34,540
如果性格不合  A型性格的人能把你逼疯
That can make you crazy if you're not like that.

345
00:17:34,590 --> 00:17:37,420
你看起来比较闲散  是B型人格
You seem pretty laid-back. Type B.

346
00:17:37,470 --> 00:17:39,640
顺便问一下  艾米是什么血型
Speaking of which, Amy's blood type?

347
00:17:40,180 --> 00:17:41,980
老天  我不知道  我得回家查一下
God, I don't know. I'd have to look it up at the house.

348
00:17:42,010 --> 00:17:43,310
你不知道她有没有朋友
You don't know if she has friends,

349
00:17:43,310 --> 00:17:44,800
也不知道她每天都做些什么
you don't know what she does all day.

350
00:17:44,850 --> 00:17:46,760
连你老婆的血型都不知道
And you don't know your wife's blood type.

351
00:17:46,810 --> 00:17:47,930
你确定你俩结婚了吗
Sure you all are married?

352
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:50,690
可能是O型
Maybe it's type O.

353
00:17:50,690 --> 00:17:52,910
-她的父母在哪  纽约吗  -是的
- Where are her folks? New York? - Yeah.

354

他们能及时赶过来参加明天的新闻发布会吗
Can they get here in time for this press conference tomorrow?

355
00:17:54,690 --> 00:17:56,730
明天吗  我不知道  我还没告诉他们
Tomorrow? I have no idea. I haven't talked to them.

356
00:17:56,780 --> 00:17:58,620
你还没给你老婆的父母打电话
You haven't called your wife's parents yet?

357
00:17:58,660 --> 00:17:59,980
这栋楼又没信号
You can't get a signal in this building.

358
00:17:59,980 --> 00:18:01,080
你又一直在跟我谈话
I've been in here talking to you.

359
00:18:01,120 --> 00:18:03,580
给他们打电话  尼克  现在就打
Call them, please, Nick. Now.

360
00:18:03,620 --> 00:18:04,830
好吧
Fine.

361
00:18:10,330 --> 00:18:12,290
我应该知道自己老婆的血型吗
Should I know my wife's blood type?

362
00:18:12,340 --> 00:18:13,340
不用
No.

363
00:18:13,670 --> 00:18:17,460
抱歉  玛丽贝思  我也不知道是怎么回事
I apologize, Marybeth. I didn't know what was going on.

我现在在警局
You know, now I'm at the station.

家里都是警察
And the cops are at the house,

366
00:18:20,620 --> 00:18:22,550
事情比较严重  所以我给你打电话
and it's serious and I'm calling you.

367
00:18:23,260 --> 00:18:26,220
现在很多事情都还不清楚
There's a lot of things that are being juggled right now.

368
00:18:26,270 --> 00:18:29,530
我现在就站在朗达·邦妮警探旁边
I'm standing right next to detective Rhonda Boney.

369
00:18:29,560 --> 00:18:31,520
她负责这个案件

00:18:33,770 --> 00:18:35,940
我岳母想跟你说几句

我不明白为什么我得待在这

这是我父亲  出什么事了

是吗  你就是尼克·邓恩

联系你一下午都没找到你
We've been trying to get a hold of you all afternoon.

379

我就在那儿  我老婆失踪了

-贱货  -别说了

你父亲午饭后离开养老院四处游荡

我们在79号公路发现了他  他迷路了

我手机在这栋楼里收不到信号
I don't get a cell signal in this building.

385
00:19:02,260 --> 00:19:04,220
我就坐在离你二十英尺的地方
I've been sitting 20 feet away from you.

386
00:19:04,560 --> 00:19:06,190
先生  请不要用这种语气跟我说话

你要不要先送他回去
You wanna drive him home?

我们的性生活好到普通床单无法承受
our sex was too good for ordinary.

428

他们有没有问你需不需要请律师

我不需要律师  好了  我来吧
I don't need a lawyer. Here, I'll do this.

433
00:21:48,550 --> 00:21:50,510
那他们有没有问关于艾米的私人问题
Well, did they ask personal stuff about Amy?

434
00:21:50,560 --> 00:21:51,730
他们问了
You know, they asked,

435
00:21:52,060 --> 00:21:53,520
为什么她没朋友
why didn't she have any friends?

What did you say?

437
00:21:54,430 --> 00:21:56,430
-我说她比较复杂  -尼克
- I said she was complicated. - Nick!

438
00:21:57,440 --> 00:22:00,070
所有人都知道  复杂的意思就是贱人
Everyone knows "Complicated" is code for "Bitch."

439

442
00:22:11,080 --> 00:22:13,580
感觉这种事一定会发生在艾米身上似的
It seems like the kind of thing that would happen to Amy.

她总是那么...

戏剧性
Drama?

445
00:22:17,250 --> 00:22:18,630
你可以说的  就我们俩
You can say it. It's just me and you.

446
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:21,220
虽然我不喜欢和艾米待在一起
Just because I don't like to be around Amy,

447
00:22:21,250 --> 00:22:22,690
但这不代表我不关心她
Doesn't mean I don't care about her.

448
00:22:25,590 --> 00:22:27,760
无论如何  带她走的人肯定会带她回来的
Anyway, whoever took her is bound to bring her back.

449

那就边洗边说
Well, we'll talk in between shampoos.

459
00:23:03,880 --> 00:23:05,180
好了  有什么发现吗

460
00:23:05,210 --> 00:23:07,840
你在厨房看到的肯定是溅出来的血

厨房嘛  刀具  准备食物什么的

应该不奇怪  但那片血迹太高了

463

所以我还要做一下荧光血迹测试

What's that?

467
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:23,810
房子是以她的名义租的  车也在她名下

00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:28,870
连他的酒吧都是在她的名下

471
00:23:28,900 --> 00:23:30,820
我不明白这有什么好奇怪的
I don't know that that's so surprising.

472
00:23:30,860 --> 00:23:32,480
不奇怪  但很耻辱
No. But it is humiliating.

473

你得看着像一夜没睡的样子

481
00:24:12,360 --> 00:24:13,690
说得还真奇怪
That's a weird thing to say.

你郁闷的时候就会喝酒

看起来比较愤怒  就像...

484
00:24:17,540 --> 00:24:19,040
千万别说  跟老爸一副德行
please don't say, "Like dad."

485
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:20,800
要么你就得发动你的乖宝宝魅力攻势
Or else you swing into your momma's-boy charm offensive,

486
00:24:20,800 --> 00:24:21,840
不过那就有点不正经了
and that can feel glib.

487
00:24:21,870 --> 00:24:22,660
很好
Perfect.

488
00:24:22,710 --> 00:24:25,460

00:30:32,830 --> 00:30:33,830
我知道
yeah, I know.

601
00:30:37,920 --> 00:30:40,210
是"小邋遢"吗  还是"贵宾犬"
It's "Puddles", right? Or is it "Poodles"?

602
00:30:44,130 --> 00:30:45,760
没事了
We're good.

603
00:30:47,340 --> 00:30:48,460
你好啊  陌生人
Hello, stranger.

604
00:30:48,510 --> 00:30:50,640
没想到能在这遇到你
Fancy meeting you here.

605
00:30:50,680 --> 00:30:52,980
这是你爸爸的屋子吧
It's your dad's house, right?

606
00:30:53,010 --> 00:30:54,640
你在跟踪我吗
Are you following me?

607
00:30:54,680 --> 00:30:55,550
你来这干什么
What you doing?

608
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,770
如你所说  这是我爸的屋子
Like you said, it's my dad's house.

609
00:30:57,810 --> 00:31:00,520
我每周都会来看一眼  防止失火什么的
I come by once a week, make sure the place hasn't burned down.

610
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:03,610
看来今天还好
But it looks okay.

611
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:06,240
我送你出去吧
I'll walk you out.

612
00:31:09,490 --> 00:31:14,280
我觉得这就是所谓的棕色小屋了
You know, I thought maybe this was the little brown house.

613
00:31:14,330 --> 00:31:15,540
线索里提到的那栋
From the clue.

614
00:31:15,580 --> 00:31:17,540
不可能  明明是蓝色
Nope. Still blue.

615
00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:38,220
想象我是个很坏很坏的女孩
Picture me, I'm a girl who's very, very bad.

616
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:41,980
我必须受到惩罚  活该被逮个正着
I need to be punished, and by "Punished," I mean "Had."

617
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:45,610
有人在那里为结婚五周年藏起了好东西
It's where you keep goodies for anniversary five.

618
00:31:45,900 --> 00:31:49,660
"快打开门来  仔细瞧一瞧
"So open the door, and look alive."

619
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:51,990
贱货
Bitch!

620
00:31:55,700 --> 00:31:56,550
想找到你婚姻的软肋吗
Want to test your marriage for weak spots?

621
00:31:56,550 --> 00:31:58,700
2010年7月18日
想找到你婚姻的软肋吗
Want to test your marriage for weak spots?

622
00:31:58,700 --> 00:31:59,370
2010年7月18日

623
00:31:59,370 --> 00:32:00,000
只需加一场经济萧条
Add one recession.
2010年7月18日

624
00:32:00,000 --> 00:32:00,830
只需加一场经济萧条
Add one recession.

625
00:32:01,170 --> 00:32:02,460
再减去两份工作
Subtract two jobs.

626
00:32:03,040 --> 00:32:05,160
出奇地有效
It's surprisingly effective.

627
00:32:05,210 --> 00:32:07,620
答应我永远别像他们一样
Promise me we'll never be like them.

628
00:32:07,670 --> 00:32:08,790
像谁一样
Like who?

629
00:32:08,840 --> 00:32:10,600
那些失败的夫妻
All those awful couples we know.

630
00:32:10,630 --> 00:32:14,590
妻子把丈夫当成马戏团的猴子
Those wives who treat their men like dancing monkeys.

631
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:16,700
训着管着还得带出去给人看
To be trained and paraded.

632
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:19,430
丈夫眼中妻子就跟公路巡警似的
Husbands who treat their wives like the highway patrol.

633
00:32:19,810 --> 00:32:22,400
怕着躲着还得时刻算计着
To be out-foxed and avoided.

634
00:32:27,150 --> 00:32:28,820
我快被炒鱿鱼了
I think I'm gonna be laid off.

635
00:32:29,610 --> 00:32:30,540
虽然现在经济衰退
We're in a recession.

636
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:32,400
不过没有过不去的坎儿
If it happens, we'll deal with it.

637
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:34,660
我可能也会失业
I'll probably be next.

638
00:32:34,700 --> 00:32:35,950
但我们拥有彼此
We have each other.

639
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:38,870
别的都是身外之物
Everything else is background noise.

640
00:32:39,950 --> 00:32:41,740
你真是独一无二
You are exceptional.

641
00:32:49,460 --> 00:32:50,710
到我说了
My turn.

642
00:32:52,590 --> 00:32:54,270
我父母的出版商不理他们
My parents' publisher dropped them,

643
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:56,050
他们现在债台高筑
and they're in debt up to their ears.

644
00:32:56,100 --> 00:32:56,930
真糟糕
That's terrible.

645
00:32:56,970 --> 00:32:59,390
他们得从我的信托基金里拿钱还债
And they need to borrow from my trust fund.

646
00:32:59,430 --> 00:33:00,930
花了多少
How much?

647
00:33:00,980 --> 00:33:03,190
差不多一百万
Almost a million.

648
00:33:03,770 --> 00:33:05,360
那不是要用完了吗
That's almost all of it.

649
00:33:05,400 --> 00:33:07,700
所以轮到你说"别的都是身外之物"了
This is where you say, "Everything else is background noise."

650
00:33:07,730 --> 00:33:08,770
艾米  要是你失业了
Amy, if you're laid off.

651
00:33:08,940 --> 00:33:10,190
我也失业了
And I'm laid off.

652
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:11,360
我已经决定好了
I said I'd do it.

653
00:33:11,400 --> 00:33:12,650
都不和我商量一下吗
Without talking to me?

654
00:33:12,700 --> 00:33:14,280
-其实...  -你说了算
- Well, it's... - Your call.

655
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:15,900
这本来就是他们的钱
Their money, technically.

656
00:33:20,330 --> 00:33:22,000
你说得对
You know what? You're right.

657
00:33:22,620 --> 00:33:24,620
别的都是身外之物
Everything else is just background noise.

658
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:39,880
还买游戏
More games?

659
00:33:39,930 --> 00:33:41,550
没错  满足一下开枪杀人的欲望
Yeah, I just wanted to shoot some folks.

660
00:33:42,770 --> 00:33:44,230
那买这手提电脑干什么
What's the laptop for?

661
00:33:45,310 --> 00:33:46,310
用
Laptoping.

662
00:33:48,560 --> 00:33:49,480
我算明白了
I see.

663
00:33:49,520 --> 00:33:51,020
你能在不和我商量的前提下
You can give your parents $879,000

664
00:33:51,030 --> 00:33:52,520
借你父母八十八万还债
without talking to me,

665
00:33:53,070 --> 00:33:55,700
而我未经你允许买款游戏就犯了天条了
but God forbid I buy a video game without getting your permission.

666
00:33:55,740 --> 00:33:56,790
你买的太多了
You are spending a lot.

667
00:33:56,820 --> 00:33:59,070
你不相信我  你不相信我的判断
You don't trust me. You don't trust my judgment.

668
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:00,680
甚至怀疑我的动机
You certainly don't trust my intention.

669
00:34:00,700 --> 00:34:01,660
你在胡扯什么
What are you talking about?

670
00:34:01,700 --> 00:34:03,320
这是咱俩婚前约法三章的
That's the basic tenet of a prenup, isn't it?

671
00:34:03,370 --> 00:34:05,620
你怎么又拿这事来说理
Why are you throwing that in my face again?

672
00:34:05,670 --> 00:34:07,210
因为我本来就占理
Because it's easy to throw.

673
00:34:07,250 --> 00:34:08,050
尼克  我不明白
Nick, I don't get it.

674
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:11,420
为什么你要逼着我变成我不喜欢的样子
I don't get why you're daring me to be someone I don't wanna be.

675
00:34:11,460 --> 00:34:14,540
变成一个唠唠叨叨控制欲爆表的泼妇
The nagging shrew. The controlling bitch.

676
00:34:14,590 --> 00:34:16,960
我不是那样的人  我是你妻子
I'm not that person. I'm your wife.

677
00:34:17,010 --> 00:34:18,180
抱歉
I'm sorry.

678
00:34:18,220 --> 00:34:20,560
我只是有点不知所措  我还未曾失业过
I just don't know how to do this. I've never not had a job.

679
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:22,600
以前我卖过汉堡  刷过墙  我不...
I flipped burgers, I painted houses. I don't...

680
00:34:22,640 --> 00:34:24,650
你会找到新工作的
You'll get another job.

681
00:34:29,060 --> 00:34:30,270
嗨  马尔
Hi, go.

682
00:34:32,020 --> 00:34:33,770
什么  等等  你说什么
What? Hold on. What?

683
00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:35,240
-突然间  -慢点儿说  怎么了
- And suddenly. - Slow down, what is it?

684
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,280
我发现一切只会变得更糟
I knew everything was about to get worse.

685
00:34:37,320 --> 00:34:38,900
告诉我发生了什么事
Okay, tell me what's wrong.

686
00:34:48,680 --> 00:34:51,900
七月七日 消失两天后

687
00:35:06,270 --> 00:35:07,770
-上帝保佑你  尼克  -神父
- Bless you, Nick. - Father.

688
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:09,860
汤姆  镇长先生  你们好
Hey, Tom. Mayor!

689
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:11,150
尼克  很高兴见到你
Nick, good to see you.

690
00:35:11,190 --> 00:35:12,190
我也是
Good to see you.

691
00:35:12,230 --> 00:35:13,480
小朋友们
Hey, guys, hey.

692
00:35:15,900 --> 00:35:17,400
-乔蒂  -尼克
- Jodie. - Nick.

693
00:35:19,110 --> 00:35:20,730
我们会找到她的
Oh, we'll find her.

694
00:35:35,710 --> 00:35:37,420
你脸色真差
You look like hammered shit.

695
00:35:37,470 --> 00:35:39,140
谢谢
Thank you.

696
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:48,950
你见过那个戴眼镜的家伙吗
You ever see that guy in the glasses before?

697
00:35:49,600 --> 00:35:50,540
别担心  我们录下了
Don't worry. We videotape everybody

698
00:35:50,540 --> 00:35:52,350
所有出入这栋建筑的人
that comes in and out of these things.

699
00:35:52,400 --> 00:35:54,190
你似乎找了不少
I mean, you tend to get a lot of...

700
00:35:54,230 --> 00:35:55,270
伪善人
Do-gooders?

701
00:35:55,320 --> 00:35:56,530
怪人
Freaks.

702
00:35:56,570 --> 00:35:58,530
我想问问你
Hey, I meant to ask you.

703
00:35:58,570 --> 00:36:00,030
诺艾尔·霍桑
Noelle Hawthorne?

704
00:36:00,910 --> 00:36:02,630
她是你邻居  也是艾米最好的朋友
She lives on your street. Amy's best friend.

705
00:36:03,740 --> 00:36:05,070
从没听过诺艾尔·霍桑这名字
I've never heard the name Noelle Hawthorne.

706
00:36:05,120 --> 00:36:07,290
就是有三胞胎的那一家
She and her husband have triplets.

707
00:36:08,620 --> 00:36:11,450
可能打过几次招呼
Yeah, we might say hi to them on the street.

708
00:36:11,830 --> 00:36:14,000
但绝不是什么最好的朋友
But "Best friend"? No.

709
00:36:14,540 --> 00:36:15,750
抱歉  我过去一下
Excuse me, one sec.

710
00:36:20,050 --> 00:36:22,140
他表现得就像和诺艾尔完全没有来往
He acted like Noelle was a complete stranger.

711
00:36:22,180 --> 00:36:23,270
意料之中
Of course he did.

712
00:36:23,640 --> 00:36:24,930
来  这两个给你
Look, these two are yours.

713
00:36:24,970 --> 00:36:27,340
看  他又在演好人了
Oh, look. He's being a good guy,

714
00:36:27,390 --> 00:36:29,310
这样所有人才会觉得他是无辜的
so everybody can see him being a good guy.

715
00:36:29,350 --> 00:36:31,140
你还真是不喜欢他啊
You really don't like him, do you?

716
00:36:31,190 --> 00:36:32,690
他哪儿讨人喜欢了
What's to like?

717
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:58,010
语音信箱已满  按1转到
This mailbox is currently full. Press one to...

718
00:36:58,050 --> 00:37:01,430
尼克  请容我自我介绍一下  我叫肖纳·凯利
Nick? I just wanted to introduce myself. My name's Shawna Kelly.

719
00:37:01,670 --> 00:37:04,380
我为你遇到的麻烦表示遗憾
I am so sorry for your troubles.

720
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:05,350
谢谢关心
Thank you. That's kind.

721
00:37:05,390 --> 00:37:06,810
你最近有好好吃饭吗
Are you remembering to eat?

722
00:37:06,850 --> 00:37:07,980
吃了不少冻肉
Well, a lot of cold cuts.

723
00:37:08,010 --> 00:37:12,180
那你可得尝尝我闻名世界的玉米鸡肉派
I'm gonna fix you up my world-famous chicken frito pie.

724
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:13,750
十分感谢  不过不用劳烦了
That's very kind and very unnecessary.

725
00:37:13,770 --> 00:37:15,400
吃饱才有力气做事
You have to keep your strength.

726
00:37:15,940 --> 00:37:16,940
你能...
Would you...

727
00:37:17,820 --> 00:37:19,700
说"玉米鸡肉派"
Say, "Chicken frito pie!"

728
00:37:23,910 --> 00:37:27,830
能麻烦你删了这张照片吗
You know what? Would you delete that picture for me?

729
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:29,750
-拍的很棒呀  -我知道
- It's a nice photo. - I know it is.

730
00:37:29,790 --> 00:37:31,210
就当帮我个忙
But just do me a favor.

731
00:37:31,250 --> 00:37:33,000
行吗
Will you?

732
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:35,960
拜托你删了这张照片吧
Would you go ahead and please delete that picture?

733
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,000
你就按一下
You just press...

734
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:38,540
你有病吧
What is wrong with you?

735
00:37:38,590 --> 00:37:39,880
那别给其他人看  行吗
Could you please not share that with anyone?

736
00:37:39,920 --> 00:37:43,250
我爱给谁看就给谁看
I will share it with whomever I please.

737
00:37:47,050 --> 00:37:48,420
-伙计  -怎么了
- Dude. - Yeah?

738
00:37:48,470 --> 00:37:49,800
你岳母生气了
Marybeth is pissed.

739
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:51,520
她生什么气
Why?

740
00:37:54,190 --> 00:37:55,770
玛丽贝思
Marybeth?

741
00:37:55,810 --> 00:37:59,230
你还把自己当成返校节国王了
It's like you're the goddamn homecoming king.

742
00:38:01,650 --> 00:38:04,110
我妈妈教导我要礼貌
It was important to my mother that I be polite.

743
00:38:04,150 --> 00:38:06,070
要做个体贴的绅士
I be considerate, I be a gentleman.

744
00:38:06,110 --> 00:38:07,820
你好像玩得还挺开心
It looked like you were having fun.

745
00:38:07,870 --> 00:38:10,120
这对我来说就是场噩梦
I am in a nightmare!

746
00:38:10,830 --> 00:38:13,250
我只是想尽量用一副好脸色
All I'm trying to do is be nice

747
00:38:13,290 --> 00:38:17,000
去面对那些乐意帮忙寻找艾米的人
to the people who are volunteering to help find Amy.

748
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,720
你说得对
You're right.

749
00:38:21,590 --> 00:38:23,550
抱歉
And I'm sorry.

750
00:38:25,550 --> 00:38:29,180
老天爷  这地方闻起来一股屎味儿

758

告诉她这可能是犯罪现场

当真
Everything?

你怎么这么问
Why would you even ask me that?

778

从艾米失踪那天早晨
Ever since you walked into the bar

00:40:03,170 --> 00:40:05,690
你走进我酒吧开始  你看起来就
that morning Amy went missing, you seem...

-不在状态  -当然了

所有人都跑来质疑我  对我评头论足

你知道我在想什么吗
You know what I keep thinking?

787
00:40:24,590 --> 00:40:25,630
如果妈妈也在这儿
If mom were here?

788
00:40:25,670 --> 00:40:29,090
是啊  就像小时候
Yeah. Like I'm 12.

789
00:40:30,550 --> 00:40:33,350
尼克  要是妈妈还在一定有办法
Nick, mom would fix it.

790
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:43,780
我该吃药睡觉了
I'm gonna go Benadryl myself to sleep.

791
00:40:46,690 --> 00:40:49,020
-爱你  -爱你
- Love you. - Love you.

792
00:40:51,840 --> 00:40:53,360
2010年9月23日

793
00:40:53,360 --> 00:40:55,400
我不得不面对一个新的现实
So, here's a strange, new sentence.
2010年9月23日

794
00:40:55,400 --> 00:40:55,450
2010年9月23日

795
00:40:55,450 --> 00:40:58,920
我现在是密苏里人了
I am a Missourian.
2010年9月23日

796
00:40:58,920 --> 00:40:59,010
2010年9月23日

797
00:41:05,710 --> 00:41:07,090
再见  爸爸
Bye, Dad.

798
00:41:09,010 --> 00:41:12,470
没钱  没工作  前途一片灰暗
No money, no jobs, no prospects.

799
00:41:12,510 --> 00:41:14,680
我们收到了马尔的消息
And then, we heard from go.

800
00:41:14,720 --> 00:41:16,640
莫林  我的婆婆
Mama Maureen.

801
00:41:16,680 --> 00:41:19,520
乳腺癌四期
Stage 4 breast cancer.

802
00:41:21,680 --> 00:41:24,520
所以  我们搬去了密苏里州
So, we moved to Missouri.

803
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:26,180
我倒不介意
I don't mind.

804
00:41:26,230 --> 00:41:29,400
只是希望他至少和我商量一下
I just wish he'd asked.

805
00:41:41,080 --> 00:41:43,540
回到老家的尼克很是开心
Nick is happy to be home.

806
00:41:43,580 --> 00:41:46,080
但我不知道我在会不会扫他的兴
But I don't know if he's happy I'm with him.

807
00:41:47,590 --> 00:41:50,840
我就像他拿错的一件行李
I feel like something he loaded by mistake.

808
00:41:50,880 --> 00:41:54,050
如有必要  丢掉也无妨
Something to be jettisoned, if necessary.

809
00:41:54,090 --> 00:41:56,300
就像一次性的东西
Something disposable.

810
00:41:58,140 --> 00:42:00,770
即便消失了他也不会在意
I feel like I could disappear.

811
00:42:04,870 --> 00:42:06,580
我在门外

812
00:42:44,770 --> 00:42:46,770
天啊
Oh, my God!

813
00:42:46,810 --> 00:42:48,770
-我在电视上看见你了  -好吧
- I saw you on TV. - Okay.

814
00:42:48,810 --> 00:42:50,480
-太疯狂了  -是的

815
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:52,730
-她就这么消失了  -离家出走而已
- She just vanished? - She's just gone.

816
00:42:52,780 --> 00:42:54,620
-我担心死你了  -你去哪儿了
- I've been so worried about you. - Where have you been?

817
00:42:54,650 --> 00:42:56,480
我给你打了无数次电话  你怎么不接
I called you a hundred times. You gotta pick up your phone!

818
00:42:56,530 --> 00:42:57,580
我在排练
Rehearsals.

819
00:42:57,610 --> 00:42:58,650
什么
What?

820
00:42:58,700 --> 00:43:00,000
《福音》

821
00:43:01,830 --> 00:43:03,420
我姐姐在隔壁睡觉呢

822
00:43:03,450 --> 00:43:04,570
我想见你
I needed to see you.

823
00:43:04,620 --> 00:43:06,280
我知道  但这太不理智了
I know this is a bad idea.

824
00:43:06,330 --> 00:43:07,830
我至少要听你说爱我
Can you at least tell me you love me?

825
00:43:07,870 --> 00:43:11,620
我是很爱你  但现在咱们必须得处处小心
I do love you, but we have to be really careful right now.

826
00:43:11,670 --> 00:43:12,930
我吓坏了
I've been so scared.

827
00:43:12,960 --> 00:43:14,170
在排练时吗
Between rehearsals?

828
00:43:14,210 --> 00:43:15,960
你让我过好自己的生活
You told me I needed to have my own life.

829
00:43:16,010 --> 00:43:17,510
我知道
I know.

830
00:43:17,550 --> 00:43:18,810
现在不行
We need to stop.

831
00:43:18,840 --> 00:43:20,010
我要你
I need you.

832

爱抚我
Touch me.

833
00:43:26,390 --> 00:43:29,010
等等  过来
Stop it. Come here.

834

坐下
Sit down.

835
00:43:32,150 --> 00:43:33,490
好
Okay.

836
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:37,610
你有没有和别人提过咱俩的事
Did you, by any chance, tell anybody anything about us?

837
00:43:37,650 --> 00:43:39,150
短信中  或者在脸书上
Even in texting, or on Facebook.

838
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:42,000
脸书  我打电话都用一次性手机
Facebook? I use the disposable phone.

839
00:43:42,030 --> 00:43:43,950
你给我买礼物也都用现金  我不傻  尼克
You buy my presents in cash. I'm not stupid, Nick.

840
00:43:43,990 --> 00:43:44,830
我知道  宝贝
I know, sweetie.

841
00:43:44,830 --> 00:43:46,870
那你是不是留了条红内裤在我办公室
Did you leave a pair of red panties in my office?

842
00:43:46,910 --> 00:43:50,330
可能吧  最好别是别人的
I don't know. Maybe. They better be mine.

843
00:43:50,370 --> 00:43:51,370
宝贝儿  好好想想
Sweetheart, think.

844
00:43:51,380 --> 00:43:53,840
我得回去数数我的红内裤有没有少
I don't know. I'd have to check my red panty inventory.

845
00:43:53,880 --> 00:43:56,510
安迪  现在可不是开玩笑的时候
Andie, I need you to take this seriously, okay?

846
00:43:56,550 --> 00:43:58,350
这是咱俩最后一次见面  直到

847
00:43:58,380 --> 00:43:59,840
到什么时候
Until when?

848
00:44:00,380 --> 00:44:01,840
到风声过去
Until it's safe.

849
00:44:01,890 --> 00:44:03,480
你说过要离婚的
You were going to get a divorce.

850
00:44:03,510 --> 00:44:05,680
别再大声说这句话了
Never say that out loud again.

851
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:08,390
好吧  抱歉
Okay. I'm sorry.

852
00:44:09,270 --> 00:44:10,270
我不想吵架
I don't wanna fight.

853
00:44:12,270 --> 00:44:13,850
我只想和你在一起

854
00:44:13,900 --> 00:44:15,070
安迪  拜托
Andie, please.

855
00:44:15,900 --> 00:44:17,570
我别无所求
That's all I want.

856
00:44:18,900 --> 00:44:19,980
现在不行
I can't.

857
00:44:22,320 --> 00:44:24,570
这是咱俩最后一次见面
It's our last time together.

858
00:44:24,620 --> 00:44:26,670
春宵一刻值千金
Let's make the most of it.

859
00:44:33,420 --> 00:44:36,760
动作快点儿  完事儿你就得走
Real quick, but then you have to go.

860
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:39,990
2011年10月2日

861
00:44:39,990 --> 00:44:42,180
我丈夫已经失控了
My husband has come undone.
2011年10月2日

862
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:42,430
2011年10月2日

863
00:44:42,430 --> 00:44:42,550
我们搬到密苏里州陪莫林治病
We moved to Missouri to save Maureen,
2011年10月2日

864
00:44:42,550 --> 00:44:45,390
我们搬到密苏里州陪莫林治病
We moved to Missouri to save Maureen,

865
00:44:45,430 --> 00:44:48,150
但结果却不尽如人愿
but as it turns out, we couldn't.

866
00:44:51,440 --> 00:44:53,190
你能来真是意义重大
It means a lot that you came.

867
00:44:54,360 --> 00:44:55,740
在上流社会受挫后
We took a hit on the brownstone,

868
00:44:55,770 --> 00:44:58,100
我用剩下的信托基金给他买了一个酒吧
and I used the last of my trust fund to buy him a bar.

869
00:44:58,860 --> 00:45:01,120
目前仍然没有盈利
So far, it's just costing money.

870
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:09,110
尼克有需求时我是他泄欲的工具
Nick uses me for sex when he wants.

871
00:45:12,290 --> 00:45:14,800
其他时候我就跟不存在一样
Otherwise, I don't exist.

872
00:45:16,040 --> 00:45:18,120
今晚我们该进城逛逛
We should go to outback tonight.

873
00:45:18,170 --> 00:45:19,420
听起来不错
That would be nice.

874
00:45:19,460 --> 00:45:22,540
昨晚  绝望的我终于踏出了可悲至极的一步
Last night, I went from desperate to pathetic.

875
00:45:23,470 --> 00:45:26,640
我变成了自己讨厌的人
I became someone I don't even like.

876
00:45:26,680 --> 00:45:28,480
变成了我以前所嘲笑轻视的女人
The kind of woman I used to mock.

877
00:45:28,890 --> 00:45:30,600
你几乎天天出门
You're out so much.

878
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:32,970
-我知道  -今晚在家待着吧
- I know. - Stay home.

879
00:45:33,020 --> 00:45:35,360
-不行  我已经迟到了  -我能一起去吗
- I can't, I'm already late. - Then, can I come?

880
00:45:35,400 --> 00:45:37,190
你会烦死的
You would hate it.

881
00:45:37,230 --> 00:45:40,480
我那帮高中同学都是大老粗
It's a bunch of my dorky high school friends.

882
00:45:41,490 --> 00:45:44,370
约法三章的  别找借口行吗
Do our code. No bullshit.

883
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:47,190
不是说好不效仿那些失败的夫妻吗
I thought we weren't gonna be that couple.

884
00:45:53,710 --> 00:45:55,550
好吧  再见
Okay, bye.

885
00:45:57,210 --> 00:46:00,180
-我一直在想  -什么
- Hey, I've been thinking. - Yeah?

886
00:46:00,210 --> 00:46:01,580
一些能带来希望的事
Something positive.

887
00:46:03,010 --> 00:46:04,050
是时候要个孩子了
Maybe it's time.

888
00:46:05,340 --> 00:46:07,170
可现在最不是时候
Now is literally the worst time.

889
00:46:07,220 --> 00:46:08,460
那会是我们的新开始
It would be a new start for us.

890
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:11,400
对我来说  我才真的有事可做
And for me, I would have a real purpose here.

891
00:46:11,430 --> 00:46:12,640
孩子可不是什么兴趣爱好
A child is not a hobby.

892
00:46:12,680 --> 00:46:13,680
不是兴趣爱好
Not a hobby.

893
00:46:14,690 --> 00:46:15,900
是我的动力
An inspiration.

894
00:46:16,440 --> 00:46:19,570
我们四小时后再争这个  我迟到了
We could have had this fight four hours ago. I'm late.

895
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:20,860
我不知道你会跟我争
I didn't know it was gonna be a fight.

896
00:46:20,900 --> 00:46:22,040
你真的想变成
You really wanna be the

897
00:46:22,040 --> 00:46:24,320
靠孩子来挽救婚姻的人吗
couple that has a baby to save their marriage?

898
00:46:24,360 --> 00:46:25,360
"挽救"
"Save"?

899
00:46:25,860 --> 00:46:28,030
重启  重组  重燃  管他什么词
Reboot, retool, rekindle, whatever!

900
00:46:28,070 --> 00:46:30,240
-而你现在就要摔门而去  -没错
- And you're gonna walk out the door now? - Yeah!

901
00:46:30,280 --> 00:46:32,820
你他妈就是个懦夫
You're a fucking coward.

902
00:46:32,870 --> 00:46:34,740
不  不能这么下去了
No, it can't go on like this.

903
00:46:34,790 --> 00:46:35,840
真的吗
Really?

904
00:46:35,870 --> 00:46:37,370
-我不准  -你不准
- I won't. - You won't?

905
00:46:37,420 --> 00:46:39,760
你不准  凭什么  这还满足不了你吗
You won't? Why, it's not good enough for you?

906
00:46:39,790 --> 00:46:40,710
差远了
It's not even close!

907
00:46:40,750 --> 00:46:42,880
你个臭婊子
You stupid bitch!

908
00:46:43,460 --> 00:46:46,420
他推开我  我并不害怕
What scared me wasn't that he'd pushed me.

909
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:50,310
我怕的是他还会怎么伤害我
What scared me was how much he wanted to hurt me more.

910
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:52,730
怕的是我终将意识到
What scared me was that I'd finally realized,

911
00:46:53,720 --> 00:46:57,390
我惧怕自己的丈夫
I am frightened of my own husband.

912
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:10,780
要我打电话叫增援吗
You want me to call for backup?

913
00:47:10,830 --> 00:47:12,920
不用了  我会保护你的
Nah, I'll protect you.

914
00:47:20,670 --> 00:47:22,090
天啊
Jesus.

915
00:47:27,130 --> 00:47:29,800
他们应该把这儿烧掉
They ought to burn this place down.

916
00:47:30,260 --> 00:47:31,920
这班家伙也快把这烧掉了
Seems like folks are trying.

917
00:47:37,440 --> 00:47:39,730
你真觉得这儿会有什么吗
You really think this is anything?

918
00:47:39,770 --> 00:47:41,930
从单子上划掉吧
Cross it off the list.

919
00:47:53,030 --> 00:47:54,740
詹森
Hey, Jason.

920
00:47:54,790 --> 00:47:56,330
怎么了  朗达
What's up, Rhonda?

921
00:47:56,370 --> 00:47:58,620
1863年林肯在葛底斯堡发表的演说
"奉行一切人生来平等的原则"
"And dedicated to the proposition that all men..."

922
00:47:59,710 --> 00:48:01,370
有在这附近看见这姑娘吗
Have you seen this girl around here?

923
00:48:01,370 --> 00:48:02,210
为什么要问她
Why do you ask?

924
00:48:02,460 --> 00:48:04,300
她失踪了
She was reported missing.

925
00:48:07,470 --> 00:48:09,350
"是否能够长久存在下去"
"And so dedicated, can long endure."

926
00:48:09,380 --> 00:48:11,300
见过  我记得她
Yeah. I remember her.

927
00:48:11,340 --> 00:48:13,470
她来买什么  大麻  摇头丸
What did she want? Weed, pills?

928
00:48:15,140 --> 00:48:16,150
她来买枪
She wanted a gun.

929
00:48:16,390 --> 00:48:18,430
我告诉她我不卖那玩意儿
I told her it's not my thing.

930
00:48:18,480 --> 00:48:21,480
我也不好受  她看上去相当绝望
I felt bad, though. She seemed really desperate.

931
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:25,100
她说要很小的  就能近距离开枪了
She said it needed to be small, so she could keep it close.

932
00:48:25,150 --> 00:48:26,990
你确定是她
Are you sure this is her?

933
00:48:27,030 --> 00:48:29,160
在这地方看到那样的姑娘可忘不了
You don't forget a girl like that in here.

934
00:48:30,150 --> 00:48:31,650
她穿着一身粉
She was all in pink.

935
00:48:31,700 --> 00:48:34,250
那天是情人节
It was Valentine's day.

936
00:48:36,510 --> 00:48:37,200
2012年2月14日

937
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:39,950
情人节我觉得我该买把枪
For Valentine's day, I thought I'd buy a gun.
2012年2月14日

938
00:48:39,950 --> 00:48:40,000
2012年2月14日

939
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,020
我都疯成这样子了
That is how crazy I've become.
2012年2月14日

940
00:48:42,020 --> 00:48:42,590
我都疯成这样子了
That is how crazy I've become.

941
00:48:43,670 --> 00:48:47,800
尼克想要我离开  可又不愿提出离婚
Nick wants me gone but he won't ask for a divorce.

942
00:48:47,840 --> 00:48:50,840
在他看来  我是他酒吧的老板
In his mind, I'm the owner of his bar,

943
00:48:50,840 --> 00:48:51,970
他唯一的资金来源
his only line of credit.

944
00:48:52,010 --> 00:48:53,520
手握婚前协议的贱人
The bitch with the prenup.

945
00:48:55,350 --> 00:48:57,690
我可以回我父母家
I could go home to my parents,

946
00:48:57,720 --> 00:49:00,140
那样我就不得不告诉他们真相
but I'd have to tell them the truth.

947
00:49:00,180 --> 00:49:04,020
可是说出来我自己都不会信
And I don't even know if I believe the truth.

948
00:49:04,060 --> 00:49:06,850
我真觉得尼克会伤害我吗
Can I really think Nick would hurt me?

949
00:49:07,480 --> 00:49:09,860
我开始妄想  太疯狂了
I'm being paranoid. Crazy.

950
00:49:11,200 --> 00:49:12,200
只是
It's just...

951
00:49:13,160 --> 00:49:15,700
有把枪在身边睡得会安稳些
I'd sleep better with a gun.

952
00:49:17,370 --> 00:49:19,550
寻人
艾米·邓恩

953
00:49:23,540 --> 00:49:26,410
七月八日  消失三天后

954
00:49:26,590 --> 00:49:28,010
糟糕
Oh, shit.

955
00:49:28,050 --> 00:49:31,680
起床了  宝贝  我姐要出来了
Wake up, baby. My sister's gonna come out here.

958
00:49:41,770 --> 00:49:43,860
穿好了
Just get that.

959
00:49:46,520 --> 00:49:48,020
小心点
Be very careful.

960
00:49:48,860 --> 00:49:49,860
我没事
I'm all right.

961
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:52,480
给你
Here you go.

962
00:49:52,530 --> 00:49:54,410
向我保证每天都要跟我说话
Promise me we'll talk every day.

963
00:49:54,450 --> 00:49:55,700
好的  会的
Okay, we will.

964
00:49:55,740 --> 00:49:58,460
每天都要  尼克  不然我会疯的
Every day, Nick, or I'll go crazy.

965
00:49:59,240 --> 00:50:00,320
不要疯
Don't go crazy.

966
00:50:00,370 --> 00:50:01,630
好的
Okay.

967
00:50:06,040 --> 00:50:09,370
你个死蠢货
You fucking idiot.

968
00:50:09,420 --> 00:50:13,250
你个王八蛋  你他妈当着我的面撒谎
You fucking asshole! You fucking lied to my fucking face!

969
00:50:14,760 --> 00:50:16,310
很抱歉
I'm sorry.

970
00:50:18,100 --> 00:50:19,100
她多大了
How old is she?

971
00:50:19,430 --> 00:50:20,630
二十出头
She's in her early 20s.

972
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:22,560
有多久了
How long?

973
00:50:23,100 --> 00:50:25,890
-一年半  -你骗了我一年多
- A year and a half. - You lied to me for over a year?

974
00:50:25,940 --> 00:50:27,620
我要是告诉你  你会阻止我的
If I told you, you would have made me stop.

975
00:50:27,650 --> 00:50:29,240
她也太小了
It's so fucking small.

976
00:50:29,270 --> 00:50:32,230
你个大骗子  就跟爸一个德行
You're a liar and a cheat! You're just like dad!

977
00:50:32,280 --> 00:50:33,570
你都怎么认识她的
How did you even meet her?

978
00:50:33,610 --> 00:50:34,820
她是我的学生
She's one of my students.

979
00:50:36,070 --> 00:50:37,740
我还以为作家都讨厌陈词滥调
I thought writers hated cliché.

980
00:50:37,780 --> 00:50:38,610
我不是作家
I'm not a writer.

981
00:50:38,660 --> 00:50:39,890
"呜呜  我被炒了
"Boo-hoo, I got laid off.

982
00:50:39,890 --> 00:50:40,910
我得去操个90后"
I guess I'll fuck a teenager."

983
00:50:40,950 --> 00:50:41,960
不是那样的  好吗
It wasn't like that, okay?

984
00:50:41,960 --> 00:50:43,740
你不知道跟艾米在一起有多惨
You have no idea how shitty it was with Amy.

985
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:45,710
她弄得我感觉多糟糕
How fucking terrible she made me feel.

986
00:50:45,750 --> 00:50:48,920
我真的郁闷得不行
Flyover boy. I would get knots in my stomach.

987
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:50,800
回家时  在我都他妈没进门之前
Just coming home, knowing she would be sitting there,

988
00:50:50,840 --> 00:50:53,000
就知道她会那么坐在那儿一脸不满
dissatisfied, before I even walked in the fucking door.

989
00:50:53,010 --> 00:50:54,430
这样太糟糕了
This is so bad.

990
00:50:54,470 --> 00:50:56,560
要是有人发现了  你就完了
If anybody finds out, you're totally fucked.

991
00:50:56,590 --> 00:50:59,210
邦妮在我办公室发现了一条内裤
Boney found a pair of panties in my office,

992
00:50:59,260 --> 00:51:00,800
偶尔安迪和我会在那儿...
where, occasionally, Andie and I...

993
00:51:01,260 --> 00:51:02,380
我都不知道这意味着什么
I don't know what the fuck it means.

994
00:51:02,430 --> 00:51:03,590
你当她们是傻逼吗
Are they super-twat's?

995
00:51:03,640 --> 00:51:05,720
她叫安迪
Her name is Andie.

996
00:51:05,770 --> 00:51:07,270
她也不太确定
She's not entirely sure.

997
00:51:07,310 --> 00:51:08,970
所以你上的这个姑娘
So we are dealing with a 20-year-old,

998
00:51:09,020 --> 00:51:10,430
都20岁了  少条内裤都不知道
who isn't sure where she leaves her undies?

999
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:12,730
如果不是安迪的  那就是艾米的
If they're not Andie's, that means that they're Amy's,

1000
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:14,490
她刻意留在那儿让我发现的
and she left them there for me to find.

1001
00:51:14,530 --> 00:51:16,490
尼克  之前我还替你担惊受怕
Nick, I was scared for you before,

1002
00:51:16,490 --> 00:51:18,290
现在我真的是目瞪口呆了
and now, I'm fucking petrified.

1003
00:51:18,320 --> 00:51:20,610
我们今晚要为你失踪的妻子守夜
We're having a vigil tonight for your missing wife.

1004
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:23,790
今早你却在跟你的小女友吻别
And this morning, you're kissing your college girlfriend goodbye!

1005
00:51:23,830 --> 00:51:25,000
你能想象吗
Can you imagine?

1006
00:51:25,620 --> 00:51:28,950
你最近有看电视吗
Have you watched television lately?

1007
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:32,010
有线台的新闻全在播你干的好事
Cable news is all over your shit.

1008
00:51:32,630 --> 00:51:34,470
这位酒吧老板犯什么毛病了
I mean, what is wrong with this barkeep?

1009
00:51:34,510 --> 00:51:36,990
妻子失踪了
His wife's nowhere to be found,

1010
00:51:36,990 --> 00:51:39,570
而这位尼克·邓恩却在与别人调情
and here's Nick Dunne for you, flirting.

1011
00:51:39,570 --> 00:51:40,510
拍得不错吧
Cute pic, huh?

1012
00:51:40,550 --> 00:51:43,010
-那是谁  -一个可悲的追星族
- Who is that? - Some fucking tragedy groupie.

1013
00:51:43,060 --> 00:51:44,980
-那他妈是谁  -我不知道
- Who the fuck is that? - I don't know.

1014
00:51:45,020 --> 00:51:46,150
她想给我做派来着
She was trying to give me a casserole.

1015
00:51:46,180 --> 00:51:47,850
今天的节目我们请到了辩护律师
On the show today we have defense attorney,

1016
00:51:47,850 --> 00:51:49,310
坦纳·博尔特
Tanner Bolt.

1017
00:51:49,350 --> 00:51:51,890
杀妻凶手的守护神
Patron Saint to wife-killers everywhere.

1018
00:51:52,190 --> 00:51:53,620
坦纳·博尔特
Tanner Bolt,

1019
00:51:53,620 --> 00:51:55,700
你真的打算为尼克·邓恩辩护吗
would you actually consider defending Nick Dunne?

1020
00:51:55,740 --> 00:51:56,870
一如既往的我想说
Well, let me just say...

1021
00:51:56,900 --> 00:51:59,650
埃伦  感谢你如此热情地欢迎我
as always, Ellen, thank you for such a warm welcome.

1022
00:51:59,700 --> 00:52:01,250
我当然会为尼克·邓恩辩护
But of course, I'd defend Nick Dunne.

1023
00:52:01,530 --> 00:52:04,030
虽然他没有在大家面前痛哭流涕
Listen, just because this guy isn't walking around weeping,

1024
00:52:04,080 --> 00:52:05,500
并不代表他就不受伤
that doesn't mean that he's not hurting.

1025
00:52:05,540 --> 00:52:07,860
坦纳  反社会的标志之一
Tanner, the hallmark of a sociopath

1026
00:52:07,860 --> 00:52:08,880
就是缺乏同情心
is a lack of empathy.

1027
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:10,880
真相是  在这种情况下要显得正常
But the truth is, you'd have to be a sociopath

1028
00:52:11,380 --> 00:52:13,170
就太反社会了
to behave normally in this situation.

1029
00:52:13,210 --> 00:52:15,960
因为这是世上最不正常的情况
Because it's the most abnormal situation in the world.

1030
00:52:16,010 --> 00:52:18,680
坦纳  你是想告诉我这张照片
Tanner, are you trying to tell me that this photo

1031
00:52:18,720 --> 00:52:20,970
根本不是正常行为吗
is remotely in the realm of acceptable behavior?

1032
00:52:21,010 --> 00:52:23,670
我最讨厌被女人批评攻击了
I'm so sick of being picked apart by women.

1033
00:52:25,060 --> 00:52:26,940
你得雇坦纳·博尔特
You need to hire Tanner Bolt.

1034
00:52:29,020 --> 00:52:29,820
我不该沦落至此
I don't deserve this.

1035
00:52:29,850 --> 00:52:31,720
无罪推定
Innocent until proven guilty.

1036
00:52:31,770 --> 00:52:34,140
你就该遭这报应
That's exactly what you deserve.

1037
00:52:34,190 --> 00:52:35,740
回去吧  尼克
Go home, Nick.

1038
00:53:01,720 --> 00:53:03,140
伙计
Hey, buddy.

1039
00:53:19,030 --> 00:53:20,820
我们居然还没逮捕这家伙
I can't believe we haven't arrested this guy.

1040
00:53:20,860 --> 00:53:22,820
不能因这金发碧眼的傻瓜的一面之辞
We're not gonna arrest anybody,

1041
00:53:22,860 --> 00:53:24,420
我们就去逮捕谁
just because some blonde dunce says so.

1042
00:53:24,780 --> 00:53:27,280
你这么给他开脱  爱上他了吗
Why are you going so easy on him? You got a crush?

1043
00:53:27,580 --> 00:53:30,920
首先  我是在办案  不是搜捕女巫
One, I am conducting an investigation, not a witch-hunt.

1044
00:53:30,960 --> 00:53:32,880
其次  别这么跟我说话  永远不要
And, two, don't talk to me that way, ever.

1045
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:34,210
她想要买枪
She was trying to buy a gun.

1046
00:53:34,250 --> 00:53:34,940
我们不知道是谁
We don't know who

1047
00:53:34,940 --> 00:53:36,420
或者什么东西吓到她了  吉尔
or what was scaring her, Gil.

1048
00:53:36,460 --> 00:53:37,460
汇报最新情况
Give me the update.

1049
00:53:37,960 --> 00:53:40,580
目前没有吸毒的可能  这条去掉了
No drug angles panned out yet, so cross that off the list.

1050
00:53:40,630 --> 00:53:42,590
我去找了照顾尼克父亲的护士们
I talked to the nurses who care for Nick's father.

1051
00:53:42,630 --> 00:53:44,350
那家伙虽是个混蛋  但虚弱到不行
The guy's a bastard, but he's weak as a kitten,

1052
00:53:44,360 --> 00:53:45,340
所以也从单子上划去
so cross that off the list.

1053
00:53:46,600 --> 00:53:47,740
鲁米诺荧光测试结果  厨房的血迹
So, luminol lit up the kitchen

1054
00:53:47,740 --> 00:53:50,020
是七月四日的
like the 4th of July.

1055
00:53:51,390 --> 00:53:52,510
血迹相当多
The blood is profuse.

1056
00:53:52,560 --> 00:53:53,670
是艾米的  B型
It is Amy's, type B,

1057
00:53:53,670 --> 00:53:54,780
很快就能提取出DNA了
and we should have DNA soon.

1058
00:53:54,810 --> 00:53:55,890
可能的凶器呢
Thoughts on a weapon?

1059
00:53:55,940 --> 00:53:57,860
这痕迹表明是被钝器重击所致
Trajectory indicates blunt force.

1060
00:53:57,900 --> 00:54:00,240
也许是根球杆  或是小木棍
Maybe a club or a two-by-four.

1061
00:54:00,820 --> 00:54:04,080
她在那儿倒下了  但我怀疑她又爬起来了
She fell there, but I doubt she got back up.

1062
00:54:04,110 --> 00:54:05,530
艾米的医疗记录拿到了吗
Amy's medical records come in?

1063
00:54:05,570 --> 00:54:07,570
还没有  今晚晚些时候能拿到
No, we'll have them later tonight.

1064
00:54:09,160 --> 00:54:10,580
我妻子说他是个杀手
My wife says he's a killer.

1065
00:54:10,830 --> 00:54:13,170
好吧  要是蒂凡尼说...
Well, if Tiffany says...

1066
00:54:45,530 --> 00:54:46,690
感谢你们都能来
Thank you all for coming out.

1067
00:54:48,370 --> 00:54:50,000
唐尼  你还好吗
Hey Donnie, how are you?

1068
00:54:50,030 --> 00:54:53,370
里克  非常感谢
Rich, thank you so much.

1069
00:55:08,720 --> 00:55:12,310
非常感谢  谢谢你们今晚能来
Thank you, folks. Thank you for being here tonight.

1070
00:55:12,350 --> 00:55:14,150
这对我们的家庭意义重大
It just means the world to our family.

1071
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:16,140
对艾米也是
And to Amy.

1072
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:18,730
大家都知道
As you all know,

1073
00:55:19,560 --> 00:55:22,850
我的妻子  艾米·艾略特·邓恩
my wife, Amy Elliott Dunne.

1074
00:55:22,900 --> 00:55:24,400
三天前失踪了
disappeared three days ago.

1075
00:55:24,990 --> 00:55:28,540
我恳求任何知道相关信息的人
And I want to implore anyone who has any information at all.

1076
00:55:28,570 --> 00:55:31,490
请站出来  帮助我们
Please come forward. Help us.

1077
00:55:31,530 --> 00:55:32,450
太性感了
So hot.

1078
00:55:32,490 --> 00:55:33,860
他太可怕了
He is so creepy.

1079
00:55:33,910 --> 00:55:34,980
我想说几句
I wanna say something,

1080
00:55:34,980 --> 00:55:37,370
因为我觉得你们也许会有疑问
because I think some of you might be wondering,

1081
00:55:37,420 --> 00:55:39,340
却又出于礼貌不便提出
and are too polite to ask.

1082
00:55:39,830 --> 00:55:42,920
我与我妻子的失踪毫不相干
I had nothing to do with the disappearance of my wife.

1083
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:45,460
我正配合警方调查
I'm cooperating with the police.

1084
00:55:45,510 --> 00:55:47,550
我也没有雇律师
I haven't hired a lawyer.

1085
00:55:47,590 --> 00:55:48,710
我没什么好隐瞒的
I have nothing to hide.

1086
00:55:50,010 --> 00:55:52,510
艾米是我的灵魂伴侣
Amy is my soul mate.

1087
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:54,050
她美丽
She is brilliant,

1088
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:57,690
迷人而又睿智
she's charming, and wise.

1089
00:55:58,020 --> 00:55:59,730
我爱你  艾米
I love you, Amy.

1090
00:56:03,860 --> 00:56:04,950
混蛋
Asshole.

1091
00:56:06,280 --> 00:56:08,200
我爱我的妻子
I love my wife.

1092
00:56:08,570 --> 00:56:09,780
十分地爱
So much.

1093
00:56:12,280 --> 00:56:16,620
也许我没有为了媒体的镜头而故作姿态
And I may not behave for the cameras the way they want me to,

1094
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:20,250
如果他们想以此惩罚我  我没意见
and if they wanna punish me for that, that's okay.

1095
00:56:20,290 --> 00:56:24,000
但我想请求那些媒体人  请来骚扰我
But I just wanna ask you in the media, please, harass me,

1096
00:56:24,050 --> 00:56:27,090
但不要去骚扰这儿的人
but don't harass the people of this town.

1097
00:56:27,130 --> 00:56:29,170
要嘲弄就嘲弄我吧
If you need to mock somebody, mock me.

1098
00:56:29,220 --> 00:56:30,430
尼克
Nick!

1099
00:56:30,470 --> 00:56:32,630
请不要把调查当儿戏
But please don't turn this investigation into a circus.

1100
00:56:32,640 --> 00:56:34,230
你妻子在哪儿  尼克
Where's your wife, Nick?

1101
00:56:34,260 --> 00:56:35,760
让警察去做他们的工作
Let the police do their jobs.

1102
00:56:36,220 --> 00:56:37,800
你对你怀孕的妻子做了什么
What did you do to your pregnant wife?

1103
00:56:39,640 --> 00:56:40,890
你告诉他们了吗  尼克
Did you tell them that, Nick?

1104
00:56:40,940 --> 00:56:42,990
你告诉他们艾米已经怀孕六周了吗
Did you tell them Amy was six weeks pregnant?

1105
00:56:46,730 --> 00:56:47,870
感谢大家今晚的支持
Thank you for your support tonight.

1106
00:56:47,870 --> 00:56:48,900
让我们一起寻找艾米
Let's find Amy.

1107
00:56:51,070 --> 00:56:52,710
继续吧  如果你们想说点什么
Go ahead, if you guys wanna say something.

1108
00:56:56,790 --> 00:56:58,170
吉尔  快去
Gil, go, go.

1109
00:57:00,500 --> 00:57:01,630
尼克  你去哪儿
Nick, where are you going?

1110
00:57:01,670 --> 00:57:03,260
拦住他
Stop him!

1111
00:57:03,290 --> 00:57:05,500
现在不接受提问  谢谢
No questions right now. Thank you.

1112
00:57:08,010 --> 00:57:09,550
你为什么要逃走
Why are you running away?

1113
00:57:10,630 --> 00:57:12,050
别跑
Don't run.

1114
00:57:13,140 --> 00:57:14,140
大家不要过来
Everybody, stay back.

1115
00:57:18,930 --> 00:57:21,100
大伙  不要拍了  你们知道规矩的
Guys, come on. You know better.

1116
00:57:21,140 --> 00:57:23,600
别踩草坪  从路缘上下来
Get off the grass, get down to the curb.

1117
00:57:23,650 --> 00:57:25,070
-吉尔  -交给我
- Hey, Gil. - On it.

1118
00:57:25,110 --> 00:57:26,150
好了
All right.

1119
00:57:26,190 --> 00:57:27,980
好了  听她的  不许拍照
All right, y'all heard her. No pictures.

1120
00:57:28,030 --> 00:57:29,320
谁
Hello?

1121
00:57:30,070 --> 00:57:31,620
谁
Hello?

1122
00:57:31,650 --> 00:57:32,480
操
Fuck.

1123
00:57:32,530 --> 00:57:34,040
你吓到我了  要喝一杯吗
You scared me. Want a drink?

1124
00:57:34,070 --> 00:57:35,570
你知道她怀孕了吗
Did you know she was pregnant?

1125
00:57:35,620 --> 00:57:36,150
我跟你说了
I told you,

1126
00:57:36,150 --> 00:57:37,750
诺艾尔·霍桑就他妈疯了
Noelle Hawthorne is fucking crazy.

1127
00:57:37,790 --> 00:57:38,830
她都不认识艾米
She doesn't even know Amy.

1128
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:41,100
我看她们是对好闺蜜呢
They look like pretty good friends to me.

1129
00:57:48,670 --> 00:57:49,940
我不知道
Look, I don't know.

1130
00:57:49,940 --> 00:57:52,090
但这也证明不了她怀孕了
But it certainly doesn't prove that she's pregnant.

1131
00:57:52,130 --> 00:57:53,340
我们很快就能拿到她的医疗记录了
We have her medical records coming.

1132
00:57:53,380 --> 00:57:55,260
-好  -趁这会我们聊聊
- Good. - So, let's talk while we wait.

1133
00:57:55,300 --> 00:57:57,510
先从这边开始  犯罪现场
Let's start over here. The scene of the crime.

1134
00:57:57,560 --> 00:58:00,440
我们见过不少私闯民宅的现场
You see, we've seen dozens of home invasions.

1135
00:58:00,470 --> 00:58:02,430
数都数不清
Dozens and dozens.

1136
00:58:02,480 --> 00:58:04,690
这块区域  我们一看见就觉得不对劲
This area right here, it looked wrong from the second we saw it.

1137
00:58:04,730 --> 00:58:07,900
一切都像是刻意摆出来的  看
The whole thing looked staged. Watch this.

1138
00:58:09,820 --> 00:58:11,800
经历了一番生死搏斗
And yet, they remained upright

1139
00:58:11,800 --> 00:58:13,240
却还能这么井然有序
throughout this life-and-death struggle?

1140
00:58:13,650 --> 00:58:15,400
我不知道  你想要我说什么
I don't know. What do you want me to say?

1141
00:58:15,450 --> 00:58:17,080
你妻子失踪后你有打扫过房子吗
Did you do any housekeeping the day your wife went missing?

1142
00:58:17,120 --> 00:58:18,120
没有
No.

1143
00:58:18,120 --> 00:58:20,370
因为我们的人做了荧光测试
Because our guys did a luminol test.

1144
00:58:20,410 --> 00:58:23,080
很遗憾地告诉你  厨房那片可亮了
And I'm sorry to tell you, but that kitchen lit up.

1145
00:58:23,120 --> 00:58:24,510
艾米在那儿流了很多血
Amy lost a lot of blood in there,

1146
00:58:24,520 --> 00:58:25,370
尼克  很多
Nick. A lot.

1147
00:58:25,420 --> 00:58:26,420
我的天哪
Oh, my God.

1148
00:58:26,420 --> 00:58:27,760
没错  接着有人给拖掉了
Yeah, and then somebody mopped it up.

1149
00:58:27,790 --> 00:58:28,380
等一下
Wait a second.

1150
00:58:28,380 --> 00:58:30,250
如果他们想要制造犯罪现场
Why would they mop up the blood,

1151
00:58:30,300 --> 00:58:31,900
为什么还要把血给拖掉
if they're trying to stage a crime scene?

1152
00:58:31,920 --> 00:58:34,670
没有血  也没有尸体  就意味着绑架
No blood and no body suggests kidnapping.

1153
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:37,140
也就告诉我们去调查外面的人
It tells us, look at people outside the house.

1154
00:58:37,180 --> 00:58:38,600
就像你一直在提的那些流浪汉
Like these homeless you keep mentioning.

1155
00:58:38,640 --> 00:58:41,730
一地的血  没有尸体  则意味着谋杀
A pool of blood and no body suggests homicide.

1156
00:58:41,770 --> 00:58:43,770
那我们就要调查家里的人
It tells us to look at people inside the house.

1157
00:58:43,810 --> 00:58:45,960
我们来就是为了这个  尼克
Which is what we're doing here, Nick.

1158
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:46,530
我知道了
I see.

1159
00:58:46,560 --> 00:58:47,880
所以你的婚姻情况如何  尼克
So, how was your marriage, Nick?

1160
00:58:47,880 --> 00:58:49,520
因为现在  只有诺艾尔的描述
Because right now, all we got is Noelle.

1161
00:58:49,570 --> 00:58:51,110
她说  "不好"
She says, "Not good."

1162
00:58:51,150 --> 00:58:52,650
吉尔  你和你妻子都因为些什么起争执
Gil, what do you and your wife argue about?

1163
00:58:52,690 --> 00:58:54,820
-什么最让你生气  -钱  缺钱
- What pisses you off? - Money, lack thereof.

1164
00:58:54,860 --> 00:58:56,610
我和我前任也是一样
Me and my ex, it's the same.

1165
00:58:56,660 --> 00:58:57,460
之所以提这个
I mention that

1166
00:58:57,460 --> 00:59:00,000
是因为我们看了你的财务状况  尼克
because we got a look at your finances, Nick.

1167
00:59:00,030 --> 00:59:02,740
十一万七千美元的信用卡债务
$117,000 in credit card debt.

1168
00:59:02,790 --> 00:59:04,750
-什么  -我调了些你买的东西的清单
- What? - I pulled up some of the merchandise.

1169
00:59:04,790 --> 00:59:06,800
都是这些大手笔的挥霍
There are these fun little splurges.

1170
00:59:06,830 --> 00:59:08,370
这些东西我都没买过
I didn't buy any of this stuff.

1171
00:59:08,420 --> 00:59:09,550
我都不打高尔夫
I don't even golf!

1172
00:59:09,590 --> 00:59:10,920
我打  你买的都是好球杆
I do! You bought great clubs.

1173
00:59:10,960 --> 00:59:12,250
我喜欢机器狗
I like the robot dog.

1174
00:59:12,300 --> 00:59:14,260
这是身份盗窃  这是重罪
This is identity theft! This is a felony!

1175
00:59:14,300 --> 00:59:15,260
我们得查出是谁干的
We need to find out who did this!

1176
00:59:15,300 --> 00:59:17,060
好吧  那我们谈谈人寿保险
All right. Let's talk about life insurance.

1177
00:59:17,090 --> 00:59:17,870
在四月份
Because in April,

1178
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:19,630
你把艾米的人寿保险保额突然提高到了
you bumped up Amy's life insurance

1179
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:20,680
一百二十万
to $1.2 million.

1180
00:59:20,720 --> 00:59:21,510
我是提高了
Yes, I did.

1181
00:59:21,510 --> 00:59:23,090
那是她的主意  她要我提高的
That was her idea. She wanted me to.

1182
00:59:23,140 --> 00:59:24,300
文书的字都是你签的
You filed the paperwork.

1183
00:59:24,350 --> 00:59:25,550
是她让我签的
Because she told me to!

1184
00:59:26,390 --> 00:59:27,310
等一等
Hold on a sec.

1185
00:59:27,350 --> 00:59:29,140
嗯  好的
Yeah? Okay.

1186
00:59:31,070 --> 00:59:32,240
你确定
For sure?

1187
00:59:32,650 --> 00:59:33,820
好吧
All right.

1188
00:59:37,910 --> 00:59:38,910
她是怀孕了
She was pregnant.

1189
00:59:42,990 --> 00:59:44,620
这事太扯了
This is insane.

1190
00:59:44,660 --> 00:59:47,160
那么我的问题就变成了...
So, my question becomes...

1191
00:59:47,210 --> 00:59:50,130
我不会再跟你说话了
I don't want to talk to you again, ever.

1192
00:59:50,170 --> 00:59:51,340
除非有律师在场
Without a lawyer.

1193
00:59:59,680 --> 01:00:00,680
马尔
Margo!

1194
01:00:14,940 --> 01:00:17,360
等一下  让我说完
Just hold on a second. Let me finish.

1195
01:00:17,400 --> 01:00:18,320
尼克
Nick?

1196
01:00:18,360 --> 01:00:21,150
我听到了  我听到了  我也很惊讶
I hear you, I hear you. I was as surprised as...

1197
01:00:21,200 --> 01:00:25,040
我知道你不开心  我也不知道她怀孕了
I know you're upset. I had no idea she was pregnant.

1198
01:00:25,450 --> 01:00:28,580
我也是这么想的  但显然...
Listen, I thought so, too, but evidently that wasn't...

1199
01:00:31,080 --> 01:00:33,210
你想知道真相吗
you want to know the truth?

1200
01:00:33,250 --> 01:00:35,620
真相就是艾米不想要孩子
The truth is, Amy didn't want kids.

1201
01:00:38,050 --> 01:00:40,100
对  我也很震惊
Well, I'm as surprised as...

1202
01:00:41,430 --> 01:00:43,230
你跟我说是你不想要孩子的
you told me you didn't want kids.

1203
01:00:44,220 --> 01:00:45,620
我可不想吵架
I was trying to put a good face on.

1204
01:00:45,640 --> 01:00:47,520
结果你老婆突然就怀孕了
Then, suddenly, you've got a pregnant wife.

1205
01:00:47,560 --> 01:00:48,900
这下你的问题严重了
That's a problem for you.

1206
01:00:48,940 --> 01:00:52,030
再加上那个秘密小情人
Especially when you factor in the secret teenage girlfriend.

1207
01:00:52,060 --> 01:00:53,520
拜托  别再看艾伦·阿伯特的节目了
Oh, stop watching Ellen Abbott!

1208
01:00:53,560 --> 01:00:54,890
那你他妈就告诉我事实
You have to fucking talk to me!

1209
01:00:57,570 --> 01:00:59,910
我没跟你说她不想要孩子
I didn't tell you that she didn't want kids,

1210
01:00:59,910 --> 01:01:01,620
是因为她不想让别人知道  好吗
because she didn't want me to. OK?

1211
01:01:01,660 --> 01:01:03,870
因为那样你们又会多一条恨她的理由
Because it would have just been another reason for you to hate her.

1212
01:01:03,910 --> 01:01:05,790
理由已经够多了  这样比较简单...
And we had enough of those already! It was easier to just...

1213
01:01:05,830 --> 01:01:08,040
-骗我吗  -我想要孩子
- lie to me? - I wanted kids!

1214
01:01:08,080 --> 01:01:10,250
我们刚搬来的时候  我去过人工受孕诊所
When we first moved here, I went to a fertility clinic!

1215
01:01:10,290 --> 01:01:11,960
-没成功吗  -我做了我那一半
- It didn't work? - I did my part!

1216
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:13,050
打飞机吗
Masturbate.

1217
01:01:13,080 --> 01:01:14,080
轮到艾米做她那一半的时候
When it came time for Amy to do her thing,

1218
01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:14,790
突然她就说
all of a sudden it was like...

1219
01:01:14,840 --> 01:01:16,380
"我不清楚诶  还是别做了吧"
"Well, I don't know. Maybe. No, thanks."

1220
01:01:16,420 --> 01:01:18,420
现在还有谁会相信你的话
Now, who would believe you?

1221
01:01:19,590 --> 01:01:20,790
好吧
All right.

1222
01:01:30,430 --> 01:01:32,220
这是诊所寄来的信
This is a letter from the clinic.

1223
01:01:32,270 --> 01:01:34,740
告诉我他们要销毁我的精子
Notifying me that they're gonna destroy my sample,

1224
01:01:34,770 --> 01:01:36,770
除非我联系他们
unless I contact them.

1225
01:01:38,030 --> 01:01:39,570
我把信给了艾米
So, I gave it to Amy.

1226
01:01:39,610 --> 01:01:42,610
第二天却在垃圾桶里找到了它
The next day, I saw it in the trash.

1227
01:01:42,660 --> 01:01:44,240
可是那时候你已经和安迪好上了吧
But you were already with Andie by then, right?

1228
01:01:44,280 --> 01:01:47,110
我想和艾米要个孩子
I wanted a baby with Amy.

1229
01:01:47,160 --> 01:01:48,690
如果一年前艾米能怀孕的话
A year ago, Amy being pregnant

1230
01:01:48,690 --> 01:01:51,340
那就再好不过了
would have been the best thing ever!

1231
01:01:57,880 --> 01:01:59,760
"当你可怜的艾米染上风寒  甜点也..."
"When your poor Amy has a cold, this dessert just..."

1232
01:01:59,800 --> 01:02:01,180
这是你没解开的提示
this is the clue you couldn't solve.

1233
01:02:01,220 --> 01:02:02,350
对
Yeah.

1234
01:02:04,050 --> 01:02:05,220
德西寄来的信
A letter from Desi.

1235
01:02:05,220 --> 01:02:07,420
是艾米的那个变态前男友吗
That creepy boyfriend of Amy's?

1236
01:02:07,470 --> 01:02:09,840
对  那个愿意为她赴汤蹈火的大款
Yeah, it was the fucking rich guy who would do anything for her.

1237
01:02:09,890 --> 01:02:11,850
老是看到他的名字  真是恶心
It just kept hanging over my head. It was disgusting.

1238
01:02:11,890 --> 01:02:12,890
你们的婚前协议
Your prenup?

1239
01:02:13,230 --> 01:02:14,800
尼克  你为啥收着这些东西
Nick, why have you kept this stuff?

1240
01:02:14,800 --> 01:02:16,190
你的恨意都在这个盒子里了
It's like a little box of hate.

1241
01:02:16,230 --> 01:02:18,020
不知道  也许我确实恨她
I don't know, go! Maybe I hate her!

1242
01:02:20,900 --> 01:02:24,020
不管怎样我都爱你
I love you no matter what.

1243
01:02:24,070 --> 01:02:25,440
但是你必须告诉我
But you need to tell me.

1244
01:02:25,490 --> 01:02:26,910
告诉你什么
Tell you what?

1245
01:02:27,740 --> 01:02:29,360
你想问我什么
What are you asking me?

1246
01:02:30,950 --> 01:02:34,120
你是要问我有没有杀我老婆吗  马尔
Are you asking me if I killed my wife, go?

1247
01:02:34,580 --> 01:02:36,660
你是要问我这个吗  我有没有杀我老婆
Is that what you're asking me? If I murdered my wife?

1248

我不会问你这种问题的
I would never ask you that!

1249
01:02:43,090 --> 01:02:44,090
马尔

1250

01:03:18,890 --> 01:03:19,850
线索三

1253
01:03:21,250 --> 01:03:22,830

他的老婆失踪了  为什么要到这儿来

1255
01:03:27,340 --> 01:03:28,340
谁在乎呢

朗达  我们已经破案了

01:09:11,560 --> 01:09:13,770
你需要一本日记
You need a diary.

1350
01:09:13,810 --> 01:09:16,730
至少三百条关于尼克和艾米的故事
Minimum, 300 entries on the Nick and Amy story.

1351
01:09:17,400 --> 01:09:19,690
先从童话般的热恋说起
Start with the fairy tale early days.

1352
01:09:19,740 --> 01:09:22,040
那些都是真的  真实得残忍
Those are true. And they're crucial.

1353
01:09:22,070 --> 01:09:24,070
必须把尼克和艾米写得非常可爱
You want Nick and Amy to be likeable.

1354
01:09:24,410 --> 01:09:27,040
然后  开始编造
After that, you invent.

1355
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:28,080
花天酒地
The spending.

1356
01:09:28,080 --> 01:09:29,880
虐待和恐惧
The abuse. The fear.

1357
01:09:29,910 --> 01:09:32,870
威胁使用暴力
The threat of violence.

1358
01:09:32,920 --> 01:09:34,880
尼克还觉得自己是作家呢
And Nick thought he was the writer.

1359
01:09:35,590 --> 01:09:36,880
烧掉刚刚好的一部分
Burn it just the right amount.

1360
01:09:38,710 --> 01:09:40,590
确定警察能找到它
Make sure the cops will find it.
输入密码

1361
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:48,650
最后  尊重传统  布置特别的寻宝游戏
Finally, honor tradition with a very special treasure hunt.

1362
01:09:51,120 --> 01:09:51,230
七月五日 失踪两小时后

1363
01:09:51,230 --> 01:09:54,030
如果我不出错  全世界都会憎恨尼克
And if I get everything right, the world will hate Nick,
七月五日 失踪两小时后

1364
01:09:54,030 --> 01:09:54,060
七月五日 失踪两小时后

1365
01:09:54,060 --> 01:09:54,470
因为他杀了自己美丽的孕妇妻子
for killing his beautiful, pregnant wife.
七月五日 失踪两小时后

1366
01:09:54,470 --> 01:09:56,770
因为他杀了自己美丽的孕妇妻子
for killing his beautiful, pregnant wife.

1367
01:09:56,820 --> 01:09:59,450
在愤怒平息后  当我准备好时
And after all the outrage, when I'm ready,

1368
01:09:59,490 --> 01:10:01,490
我会吃上一把安眠药  然后跳进水里
I'll go out on the water with a handful of pills,

1369
01:10:01,490 --> 01:10:04,040
口袋里装满石头
and a pocket full of stones.

1370
01:10:04,070 --> 01:10:06,860
当他们找到我的尸体  他们会认为
And when they find my body, they'll know,

1371
01:10:06,910 --> 01:10:10,210
尼克·邓恩像扔垃圾一样抛弃了他的妻子
Nick Dunne dumped his beloved like garbage.

1372
01:10:10,250 --> 01:10:12,590
而她则缓缓飘落  飘过那些
And she floated down past all the other

1373
01:10:12,620 --> 01:10:15,950
受尽凌辱  无人理会  无处求援的女人
Abused, unwanted, inconvenient women.

1374
01:10:17,340 --> 01:10:19,300
然后  尼克也会死去
Then, Nick will die, too.

1375
01:10:20,170 --> 01:10:22,040
尼克和艾米会彻底消失
Nick and Amy will be gone.

1376
01:10:22,090 --> 01:10:24,210
不过  我们也从没存在过
But, then, we never really existed.

1377
01:10:24,260 --> 01:10:27,480
尼克爱上的只是我扮演的女孩罢了
Nick loved a girl I was pretending to be.

1378
01:10:27,510 --> 01:10:28,510
"好妹子"
"Cool girl."

1379
01:10:28,970 --> 01:10:32,810
男人总是这么拍女孩马屁  不是吗
Men always use that, don't they? As their defining compliment.

1380
01:10:32,850 --> 01:10:33,850
"她是个好妹子"
"She's a cool girl."

1381
01:10:34,980 --> 01:10:36,110
好妹子很性感
Cool girl is hot.

1382
01:10:36,150 --> 01:10:37,570
好妹子热情勇敢
Cool girl is game.

1383
01:10:37,610 --> 01:10:38,610
好妹子幽默风趣
Cool girl is fun.

1384
01:10:38,940 --> 01:10:41,440
好妹子从不对她的男人生气
Cool girl never gets angry at her man.

1385
01:10:41,490 --> 01:10:44,120
她只会露出谦卑又忠诚的微笑
She only smiles in a chagrined, loving manner

1386
01:10:44,780 --> 01:10:47,740
然后把嘴凑上去被操
And then presents her mouth for fucking.

1387
01:10:47,780 --> 01:10:49,780
她喜欢他爱的一切
She likes what he likes.

1388
01:10:49,830 --> 01:10:53,290
她的男人肯定是个喜欢色情漫画的音乐迷
So evidently, he's a vinyl hipster who loves fetish manga.

1389
01:10:54,330 --> 01:10:57,620
如果他喜欢狂野的女孩  她就是个时尚潮女
If he likes girls gone wild, she's a mall babe,

1390
01:10:57,670 --> 01:11:01,470
会在猫头鹰餐厅忍受着辣翅大聊橄榄球
who talks football and endures buffalo wings at Hooters.

1391
01:11:01,510 --> 01:11:05,100
遇到尼克·邓恩的时候  我知道他想要个好妹子
When I met Nick Dunne, I knew he wanted cool girl.

1392
01:11:05,130 --> 01:11:07,800
我承认  我愿意为了他尝试一次
And for him, I'll admit, I was willing to try.

1393
01:11:07,850 --> 01:11:09,850
我用蜜蜡刮掉了我的阴毛
I wax-stripped my pussy raw.

1394
01:11:10,520 --> 01:11:12,520
我喝着罐装啤酒看亚当·桑德勒的喜剧
I drank canned beer watching Adam Sandler movies.

1395
01:11:12,520 --> 01:11:13,650
阅读眼镜
我喝着罐装啤酒看亚当·桑德勒的喜剧
I drank canned beer watching Adam Sandler movies.

1396
01:11:13,890 --> 01:11:16,680
我吃冷掉的披萨  保持完美身材
I ate cold pizza and remained a size two.

1397
01:11:16,730 --> 01:11:18,690
基本上定期给他口交
I blew him semi-regularly.

1398
01:11:20,020 --> 01:11:21,350
我活在当下
I lived in the moment.

1399
01:11:21,650 --> 01:11:24,190
我他妈享受人生
I was fucking game.

1400
01:11:24,820 --> 01:11:26,860
不能说我一点儿都不喜欢那样
I can't say I didn't enjoy some of it.

1401
01:11:27,700 --> 01:11:31,000
尼克发掘了我性格中从未出现过的部分
Nick teased out of me things I didn't know existed.

1402
01:11:31,040 --> 01:11:34,340
温和  幽默  轻松
A lightness, a humor, an ease.

1403
01:11:34,370 --> 01:11:37,290
但我也让他变得更聪明  更锋利
But I made him smarter. Sharper.

1404
01:11:37,330 --> 01:11:40,960
让他成为了和我旗鼓相当的对手
I inspired him to rise to my level.

1405
01:11:41,000 --> 01:11:44,730
我造就了自己的梦中情人
I forged the man of my dreams.

1406
01:11:44,730 --> 01:11:44,750
七月五日 失踪十小时后
我造就了自己的梦中情人
I forged the man of my dreams.

1407
01:11:44,750 --> 01:11:47,090
七月五日 失踪十小时后

1408
01:11:47,090 --> 01:11:49,000
我们乐于扮演别人
We were happy pretending to be other people.
七月五日 失踪十小时后

1409
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:50,010
我们乐于扮演别人
We were happy pretending to be other people.

1410
01:11:50,050 --> 01:11:51,880
我们是最幸福的夫妻
We were the happiest couple we knew.

1411
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:54,780
如果不是最幸福的一对
And what's the point of being together,

1412
01:11:54,780 --> 01:11:56,520
那还在一起干什么呢
if you're not the happiest?

1413
01:11:57,190 --> 01:11:59,400
可尼克变得懒惰
But Nick got lazy.

1414
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:01,650
变成了我绝不会嫁给的男人
He became someone I did not agree to marry.

1415
01:12:01,690 --> 01:12:04,860
他居然希望我无条件地爱他
He actually expected me to love him unconditionally.

1416
01:12:05,530 --> 01:12:07,550
然后他把身无分文的我
Then he dragged me, penniless,

1417
01:12:07,550 --> 01:12:10,040
拖来了中部的穷乡僻壤
to the navel of this great country

1418
01:12:10,070 --> 01:12:14,030
给自己找了个更新鲜  更年轻  更活泼的
And found himself a newer, younger, bouncier

1419
01:12:14,080 --> 01:12:15,080
好妹子
Cool girl.

1420
01:12:17,420 --> 01:12:18,830
我会看着他毁掉我
You think I'd let him destroy me

1421
01:12:18,830 --> 01:12:21,590
然后自己去过幸福生活吗
And end up happier than ever?

1422
01:12:22,090 --> 01:12:23,760
门都没有
No fucking way.

1423
01:12:24,130 --> 01:12:25,930
他不会赢的
He doesn't get to win.

1424
01:12:36,270 --> 01:12:40,230
我可爱  有魅力  正直的密苏里男生
My cute, charming, salt-of-the-earth, Missouri guy.

1425
01:12:42,650 --> 01:12:45,110
他需要上一课
He needed to learn.

1426
01:12:45,820 --> 01:12:48,450
成年人会努力争取
Grown-ups work for things.

1427
01:12:48,990 --> 01:12:50,950
成年人会付出努力
Grown-ups pay.

1428
01:12:52,330 --> 01:12:54,920
成年人会承担后果
Grown-ups suffer consequences.

1429
01:12:58,410 --> 01:12:59,620
等一下
Wait.

1430
01:13:00,000 --> 01:13:02,800
给我二十秒  不要责备我或者打断我
I need 20 seconds where you don't judge me, interrupt me

1431
01:13:02,840 --> 01:13:04,470
也别生气
Or get angry.

1432
01:13:05,920 --> 01:13:07,460
好吧
Okay.

1433
01:13:11,430 --> 01:13:13,390
这是信用卡账单上的那些东西吗
Is that all the stuff from the credit cards?

1434
01:13:13,430 --> 01:13:16,600
五周年纪念的东西都放哪了
Where do you store goodies for anniversary five?

1435
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:17,430
木婚
Wood.

1436
01:13:17,480 --> 01:13:20,610
-所以是小木屋  -我的小木屋
- Woodshed. - Yeah, my woodshed.

1437
01:13:20,650 --> 01:13:23,150
那个该死的贱人
That fucking bitch.

1438
01:13:24,980 --> 01:13:26,310
-我还以为...  -没关系
- I thought... - It's all right.

1439
01:13:26,360 --> 01:13:27,820
换我也会那么想
I would have, too.

1440
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:32,480
那礼物是什么
What's that present?

1441
01:13:32,530 --> 01:13:34,280
不知道
I don't know.

1442
01:13:34,330 --> 01:13:36,290
打开看看吧
Let's find out.

1443
01:13:42,880 --> 01:13:44,260
"亲爱的老公  我知道
"Dear husband, I know

1444
01:13:44,260 --> 01:13:46,800
你以为自己可以在这个世界上为所欲为
You think you're moving through this world unseen.

1445
01:13:46,840 --> 01:13:48,260
别再这么想了
Don't believe that for a second.

1446
01:13:48,300 --> 01:13:50,580
我知道你去过哪里  也知道你将要去哪里
I know where you've been, and I know where you're going.

1447
01:13:53,800 --> 01:13:55,840
这个纪念日  我安排了一次旅行
For this anniversary, I've arranged a trip.

1448
01:13:55,890 --> 01:13:57,770
沿着河流  一直向上
Follow the river, up, up, up.

1449
01:13:57,810 --> 01:14:00,520
好好享受吧  因为你已经完蛋了
Sit back and relax, because you are done."

1450
01:14:00,560 --> 01:14:01,980
"沿河向上"是什么意思
What's "Up, up river"?

1451
01:14:02,020 --> 01:14:04,190
进监狱的意思
"Up the river." Prison.

1452
01:14:04,230 --> 01:14:06,150
这贱人真他妈疯了
Fucking crazy bitch.

1453
01:14:06,190 --> 01:14:07,810
原来是这样
That's what this is.

1454
01:14:07,860 --> 01:14:10,160
她想诬陷我谋杀了她
She's framing me for her murder.

1455
01:14:10,190 --> 01:14:11,480
你娶了个变态啊
You married a complete psychopath.

1456
01:14:11,530 --> 01:14:13,660
周年纪念那天早上
The morning of our anniversary

1457
01:14:13,700 --> 01:14:18,000
我想跟她提离婚的  我实在受不了了
I was gonna ask her for a divorce. I just couldn't do it.

1458
01:14:18,040 --> 01:14:20,500
没办法再假装下去  一天都不行
I couldn't fake it for another year, another day.

1459
01:14:20,540 --> 01:14:21,460
结果呢
Then what happened?

1460
01:14:21,500 --> 01:14:22,800
在我开口以前  她说
Before I could say anything, she said,

1461
01:14:22,830 --> 01:14:24,520
"我希望你出去静一静
"I need you to go somewhere,

1462
01:14:24,520 --> 01:14:26,210
想想我们的婚姻"
and really think about our marriage."

1463
01:14:26,250 --> 01:14:27,500
她知道我会去索耶沙滩
She knew I would go to Sawyer beach.

1464
01:14:27,550 --> 01:14:28,840
这样你就没有不在场证明了
So you'd have no alibi.

1465
01:14:28,880 --> 01:14:31,100
她一步步操纵了我
She stage-managed me.

1466
01:14:31,380 --> 01:14:35,050
她知道我会怎么做  我他妈还真的那么做了
She knew exactly what I would do. And I fucking did it.

1467
01:14:35,090 --> 01:14:36,630
我去了沙滩  思考了我们的婚姻
I went to the beach, I thought about our marriage.

1468
01:14:36,680 --> 01:14:38,390
决定回去提出离婚
I came back and decided I wanted a divorce.

1469
01:14:38,430 --> 01:14:39,670
但等你到家的时候
And by the time you got home,

1470
01:14:39,680 --> 01:14:41,220
她已经不见了
she was gone.

1471
01:14:41,850 --> 01:14:44,360
-真他妈的  -她真厉害
- You fuck! - She's good.

1472
01:14:45,350 --> 01:14:47,350
想到她不在了
Part of me was relieved

1473
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:49,700
我有点解脱了的感觉
when I thought she was gone.

1474
01:14:54,070 --> 01:14:55,780
潘趣与朱迪的木偶
Punch and Judy puppets.

1475
01:14:58,080 --> 01:15:01,870
记得吗  他把朱迪打死  又杀了孩子
Remember, he beats Judy to death and kills that baby.

1476
01:15:01,910 --> 01:15:03,030
所以我是潘趣咯
So I'm punch.

1477
01:15:04,040 --> 01:15:04,740
这我们都知道了
We already knew that.

1478
01:15:04,740 --> 01:15:06,050
艾米  你想表达什么
Amy, what's your point?

1479
01:15:07,210 --> 01:15:10,050
密苏里州有死刑吗
Does Missouri have the death penalty?

1480
01:15:14,320 --> 01:15:18,700
七月六日 消失一天后

1481
01:15:19,860 --> 01:15:22,990
自杀?

1482
01:15:23,370 --> 01:15:24,370
自杀?

1483
01:15:26,160 --> 01:15:27,660
自杀?
丢掉所有东西
把车丢掉
没有指纹
擦干净

1484
01:15:29,480 --> 01:15:30,750
在艾伦·阿伯特的网站发匿名留言
寻找丢车地点

1485
01:15:36,950 --> 01:15:38,370
邻居你好啊
Hey, neighbor.

1486
01:15:39,280 --> 01:15:41,660
我已经好几周没见到正常的邻居了
It's been weeks since I had anyone decent next door.

1487
01:15:42,290 --> 01:15:44,920
我可不知道自己算不算正常
Well, I don't know how decent I feel.

1488
01:15:44,960 --> 01:15:46,310
只要你不养蛇
As long as you don't own a python,

1489
01:15:46,310 --> 01:15:48,090
或者在凌晨四点放死亡金属
and blast death metal at 4 am,

1490
01:15:48,130 --> 01:15:50,130
咱们就能成好闺蜜
we're gonna be best friends.

1491
01:15:50,170 --> 01:15:52,260
好吧  很高兴认识你
All right. Nice meeting you.

1492
01:15:52,300 --> 01:15:53,890
我是格蕾塔
I'm Greta.

1493
01:15:54,510 --> 01:15:55,800
我是南希
I'm Nancy.

1494
01:15:55,840 --> 01:15:57,800
你要去码头吗  我需要涂点防晒霜
Are you going to the marina? I could use some creamer.

1495
01:15:57,840 --> 01:15:59,260
抱歉  我帮不了你
I'm sorry. I can't.

1496
01:15:59,300 --> 01:16:00,510
我还有事要做
I've got work to do.

1497
01:16:00,810 --> 01:16:02,850
好吧  回头见
All right. See you around!

1498
01:16:03,140 --> 01:16:05,050
会的
You will.

1499
01:16:16,550 --> 01:16:20,170
七月七日 失踪两天后

1500
01:16:42,110 --> 01:16:42,320
艾伦·阿伯特

1501
01:16:51,020 --> 01:16:56,230
快  让我看看你的专属亲切微笑
Come on. Show me that darling Nicky smile.

1502
01:16:58,030 --> 01:16:59,910
你个混蛋
You asshole.

1503
01:17:13,850 --> 01:17:19,320
七月八日 失踪三天后

1504
01:17:19,680 --> 01:17:21,430
南希
Nancy.

1505
01:17:23,720 --> 01:17:25,550
南希
Nancy.

1506
01:17:26,560 --> 01:17:28,770
今天又热起来了
It's hot again today.

1507
01:17:30,560 --> 01:17:32,890
你从哪来的
So, where are you from?

1508
01:17:33,400 --> 01:17:34,570
我猜猜
Let me guess.

1509
01:17:37,690 --> 01:17:38,690
内布拉斯加州
Nebraska.

1510
01:17:40,910 --> 01:17:42,120
是新奥尔良市
New Orleans.

1511
01:17:45,580 --> 01:17:48,080
如果要涂防晒油  我技术很好的
You know, I am an expert oiler.

1512
01:17:48,120 --> 01:17:49,910
我猜也是
Oh, I just bet you are.

1513
01:17:49,960 --> 01:17:52,590
润肤乳和香精  还有防晒霜
Lotions and balms. Ointment.

1514
01:17:53,290 --> 01:17:55,210
你们被晒黑了我可是会心疼的
I would hate for y'all to get tan lines.

1515
01:17:55,250 --> 01:17:57,250
真贴心
So sweet.

1516
01:17:58,090 --> 01:18:00,760
好吧  你们知道到哪里可以找到我
Okay. You know where I'll be.

1517
01:18:03,640 --> 01:18:06,060
看来我们挑男人的眼光一致啊
I see we have the same taste in men.

1518
01:18:07,770 --> 01:18:10,020
那种眼光已经被我丢进浴室的柜子里了
I clipped it on a bathroom cabinet.

1519
01:18:10,060 --> 01:18:13,110
至少你可以不必为他保守秘密了
Least you could do is not keep his secrets for him.

1520
01:18:14,150 --> 01:18:15,530
我猜猜看
Let me guess.

1521
01:18:15,570 --> 01:18:19,450
他想看比赛  而你却在旁边唠叨个没完
He's trying to watch the big game and you just won't shut up.

1522
01:18:19,740 --> 01:18:22,580
不对  你看起来不像是话多的人
No, you don't seem like much of a talker.

1523
01:18:22,610 --> 01:18:23,610
我懂了
I got it.

1524
01:18:23,610 --> 01:18:26,070
你男人被你捉奸在床
You caught your boy rubbing up on some hot little skank,

1525
01:18:26,120 --> 01:18:28,120
他也搅了你的好事  当做礼尚往来
and he apologized to you by busting you a good one.

1526
01:18:30,500 --> 01:18:31,500
更糟糕
Worse.

1527
01:18:31,620 --> 01:18:32,620
更糟吗
Worse?

1528
01:18:33,460 --> 01:18:37,170
我去他上班的酒吧想给他一个惊喜
I went to the bar where he works to surprise him.

1529
01:18:37,210 --> 01:18:38,710
结果他和一个
And out he comes with

1530
01:18:38,710 --> 01:18:41,920
完全不该出现在酒吧的女孩出来了
this girl who had no business being in a bar.

1531
01:18:44,890 --> 01:18:46,890
我们相识的第一个晚上
On the very first night that we met,

1532
01:18:47,140 --> 01:18:51,310
走过一家在卸糖霜的面包店
we walked by a bakery that was having their sugar delivered.

1533
01:18:52,140 --> 01:18:54,520
漫天都是糖霜  到处都是
And it was in the air, everywhere.

1534
01:18:54,560 --> 01:18:56,850
像一场糖霜暴风雪
A sugar storm.

1535
01:18:56,900 --> 01:18:59,030
他第一次吻我之前
And before he kissed me,

1536
01:18:59,070 --> 01:19:01,160
他俯过身
he leaned in,

1537
01:19:02,650 --> 01:19:04,940
做了这个动作
and did this.

1538
01:19:15,630 --> 01:19:18,090
-猜猜怎么着  -怎么了
- And guess what. - What?

1539
01:19:18,130 --> 01:19:19,840
他对她做了同样的动作
He did the exact same thing with her.

1540
01:19:24,090 --> 01:19:27,090
这是我听过的最让我恶心的事了
That is the most disgusting thing I ever heard.

1541
01:19:27,140 --> 01:19:28,850
谢谢你
Thank you.

1542
01:19:43,610 --> 01:19:45,190
非常感谢
Thanks very much.

1543
01:19:51,990 --> 01:19:54,280
好了  我们成焦点了
Well, we've gone mainstream.

1544
01:19:54,430 --> 01:19:58,680
七月九日 失踪四天后

1545
01:20:09,890 --> 01:20:13,020
这是上诉程序  我们会尝试起诉他们
It's an appeals process, so we will attempt to appeal to them.

1546
01:20:13,060 --> 01:20:15,190
博尔特先生  坦纳·博尔特
Mr. Bolt. Tanner Bolt?

1547
01:20:17,060 --> 01:20:18,470
尼克·邓恩
Nick Dunne.

1548
01:20:18,520 --> 01:20:20,810
我一直在等你的电话  我的朋友
I have been sitting by the phone, my friend.

1549
01:20:24,280 --> 01:20:25,530
抱歉
I'm sorry.

1550
01:20:25,570 --> 01:20:27,410
你不相信我吗
Do you not believe me?

1551
01:20:27,450 --> 01:20:30,700
不  我相信  但这是我听过的最疯狂的事
No, I believe you. It's just the craziest thing I've ever heard.

1552
01:20:30,740 --> 01:20:34,070
我挺喜欢的  但对你来说  糟糕透顶
I love it. But, for you, it sucks.

1553
01:20:34,790 --> 01:20:36,120
但这种情况下你不是应该
But you gotta have a grudging respect

1554
01:20:36,120 --> 01:20:38,090
向她的手段致敬吗
for your wife at this point, right?

1555
01:20:38,120 --> 01:20:39,700
-你是想把我嘲笑出去吗  -不
- Are you laughing me out of the building? - No!

1556
01:20:39,750 --> 01:20:41,500
开什么玩笑  案子我接了
Are you kidding me? I'm in.

1557
01:20:41,540 --> 01:20:43,000
必须接
I'm way in.

1558
01:20:43,050 --> 01:20:45,680
你找对人了  我就接这种案子  尼克
You came to the right guy. This is what I do, Nick.

1559
01:20:45,720 --> 01:20:47,720
所以我的定金是十万
This is why I have a $100,000 retainer.

1560
01:20:47,720 --> 01:20:49,140
我能打赢"必输"的官司
I win the unwinnable cases.

1561
01:20:49,180 --> 01:20:50,850
十万
$100,000?

1562
01:20:50,890 --> 01:20:52,430
这个我们可以想办法
We'll figure something out.

1563
01:20:52,470 --> 01:20:53,510
我会给你一个特别的
I'll give you a special

1564
01:20:53,510 --> 01:20:56,430
"我的妻子深谙复仇之术"折扣
"My wife is skilled in the art of vengeance" Rate.

1565
01:20:56,480 --> 01:20:57,520
好吧
Okay.

1566
01:20:57,560 --> 01:20:59,190
那么  打算怎么办
So, what's the plan?

1567
01:20:59,230 --> 01:21:01,110
眼下  是双方各执一词的阶段
Well, right now, it's a "He said, she said."

1568
01:21:01,150 --> 01:21:03,610
-她说的故事比我的好  -不  尼克
- She's telling a better story. - No, Nick.

1569
01:21:03,650 --> 01:21:05,490
她讲诉的故事堪称完美
She is telling the perfect story.

1570
01:21:05,780 --> 01:21:07,020
所以今天我们就要开始
So, we need to start today

1571
01:21:07,020 --> 01:21:09,080
准备你的辩词  如果用得上的话
to prepare your defense, should we need it.

1572
01:21:09,110 --> 01:21:11,510
-而如果我们决定采用你的版本  -真相
- And if we decide to go with your version of... - The truth.

1573
01:21:12,410 --> 01:21:15,750
那我们需要改变公众对艾米的看法
Then we'll need to realign the public's perception of Amy.

1574
01:21:15,790 --> 01:21:18,040
不能再让他们把她当美国甜心
Make them stop seeing her as America's sweetheart,

1575
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:19,450
而是看清她的本质
and see her for what she is,

1576
01:21:19,450 --> 01:21:21,410
一个善于操纵别人思想的人
which a mind-fucker of the first degree.

1577
01:21:21,830 --> 01:21:23,640
现在  这是个浩大的改观工程
Now, that is a huge realignment.

1578
01:21:23,650 --> 01:21:25,790
除你之外  我们还需要其他人的声音
We'll need other voices besides yours.

1579
01:21:25,840 --> 01:21:26,720
必须有一个人
There has to be someone out there

1580
01:21:26,720 --> 01:21:28,100
曾经吃过她苦头的人
that she's screwed with in the past.

1581
01:21:28,130 --> 01:21:31,210
有个纽约人  叫汤米·欧哈拉
There's a New York guy. O'Hara, Tommy O'Hara.

1582
01:21:31,260 --> 01:21:33,630
八年前  她起诉过他
Eight years ago, she pressed charges against him.

1583
01:21:33,680 --> 01:21:35,850
那应该很容易找到
That should be easy to find.

1584
01:21:36,390 --> 01:21:39,760
曾经的同学  德西·柯林斯
Ex-classmate, Desi Collings.

1585
01:21:39,810 --> 01:21:41,690
她说他跟踪过她  他住在圣路易斯
She said that he stalked her. He's in St. Louis.

1586
01:21:42,980 --> 01:21:45,230
你去找汤米  我去起草合同
You go talk to Tommy, and I'll draw up the contract.

1587
01:21:49,530 --> 01:21:52,540
和你说了  你找对人了
I told you, you came to the right guy.

1588
01:21:54,740 --> 01:21:55,950
是的
Apparently.

1589
01:22:05,000 --> 01:22:06,790
汤米
Tommy?

1590
01:22:06,840 --> 01:22:08,390
我是
Yeah.

1591
01:22:08,800 --> 01:22:10,760
-谢谢你来见我  -没事
- Thanks for seeing me. - Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1592
01:22:13,850 --> 01:22:15,560
你需要喝点东西
You're gonna want a drink.

1593
01:22:16,100 --> 01:22:17,440
对
Yeah.

1594
01:22:17,470 --> 01:22:20,260
她说你对她动粗了
So, she said you got physical with her.

1595
01:22:20,310 --> 01:22:23,280
不  哥们  她说我强奸她
No, dude, she said I raped her.

1596
01:22:23,310 --> 01:22:25,680
强奸是一级重罪
First degree, felony rape.

1597
01:22:26,440 --> 01:22:28,150
-你做了吗  -你呢
- Did you do it? - Did you do it?

1598
01:22:29,320 --> 01:22:31,410
可能要蹲30年大牢  甚至终身监禁
I was looking at 30 years to life.

1599
01:22:31,950 --> 01:22:33,490
-你有被庭审过吗  -他妈的根本没有
- Did you get a trial? - Fuck, no.

1600
01:22:33,530 --> 01:22:35,740
我看起来像能吃牢饭的人吗
Do I look like I would do well in the yard?

1601
01:22:35,780 --> 01:22:38,700
我做了个辩诉交易  只是性侵  无需入狱
I pled down, man. Sexual assault one, no jail time.

1602
01:22:39,120 --> 01:22:40,790
-那也不是小事  -是啊
- That's something. - Oh, yeah.

1603
01:22:40,830 --> 01:22:42,250
这八年来我都找不到工作
I've been unemployed for the last eight years,

1604
01:22:42,290 --> 01:22:43,160
因为我必须在每一份求职信上
because I have to write

1605
01:22:43,170 --> 01:22:44,800
注明我曾性侵他人
"Sexual offender" on every job application.

1606
01:22:44,830 --> 01:22:46,150
邻里监督组织那里也有我的名字
I'm on a neighborhood watch list,

1607
01:22:46,160 --> 01:22:47,790
因为我不得不报备自己是名危险分子
because I have to register as a predator.

1608
01:22:47,840 --> 01:22:49,720
我快十年没交过女朋友了
I haven't had a date in almost a decade,

1609
01:22:49,720 --> 01:22:51,180
因为只要她们上网搜索我...
because if a girl googles me...

1610
01:22:53,130 --> 01:22:55,050
你能和我说说这是怎么回事吗
Could you walk me through what happened?

1611
01:22:55,340 --> 01:22:58,470
我在这场派对上认识了艾米
I meet Amy at this party, you know?

1612
01:22:58,510 --> 01:23:00,140
我们一拍即合  她很完美
We click. She's perfect.

1613
01:23:00,180 --> 01:23:02,510
漂亮  聪明  又博览群书
She's beautiful, she's smart, she's well-read.

1614
01:23:02,560 --> 01:23:04,860
还有二十岁脱衣舞娘的妖娆身材
She's got an ass like a 20-year-old stripper.

1615
01:23:04,900 --> 01:23:06,690
我想  "这里面有什么内幕"
I think, "What's the catch?"

1616
01:23:06,730 --> 01:23:09,900
几个月之后  我才想到  这事不会善了
A few months, it hits me. This is not going to be easy.

1617
01:23:10,570 --> 01:23:13,620
女生就像需要修缮的房屋  但是艾米
Girls like a fixer-upper, but Amy?

1618
01:23:13,650 --> 01:23:17,110
我成了她的附属物  她把我当成她的东西
She annexed me. She made me her business.

1619
01:23:17,160 --> 01:23:20,960
有点过分了  她出去给我买领带
It was just too much. She went out and bought me ties.

1620
01:23:21,000 --> 01:23:23,210
我们至少去了二十趟
And we must have gone 20 rounds over that.

1621
01:23:23,250 --> 01:23:26,010
就买个领带  这整件事变得...
Ties. The whole thing just became...

1622
01:23:26,040 --> 01:23:29,830
-所以你和她分手  -不  我只是躲着她
- So, you broke up with her. - No, I just backed away.

1623
01:23:29,880 --> 01:23:32,680
给她点空间  没什么大不了  对吧
Gave her some space. No big deal, right?

1624
01:23:32,720 --> 01:23:34,390
我是这么想的
So I thought.

1625
01:23:34,430 --> 01:23:36,720
后来有天晚上  艾米来我家
Then one night, Amy comes over to my place,

1626
01:23:36,760 --> 01:23:39,680
带了一瓶波旁威士忌和我喜欢的乐队的盗版碟
with a bottle of Bourbon and a bootleg of this band I love.

1627
01:23:39,720 --> 01:23:42,720
不到两分钟  她把我内裤脱了
And within two minutes, she's got my pants around my ankles,

1628
01:23:42,770 --> 01:23:44,360
然后她跪着  然后...
and she is kneeling down, and...

1629
01:23:44,390 --> 01:23:46,390
抱歉  我知道她是你妻子
I'm sorry. I know it's your wife.

1630
01:23:46,440 --> 01:23:48,320
-你们做爱了  -对  两厢情愿的
- You had sex? - Yeah, consensual.

1631
01:23:48,360 --> 01:23:50,450
很激烈  但那是她强烈要求的
It was rough, but she was screaming for it.

1632
01:23:50,900 --> 01:23:53,240
第二天早上  两名警察来敲我的门
Next morning, there's two cops at my door.

1633
01:23:53,570 --> 01:23:56,490
艾米的受伤情况与强奸吻合
Amy has wounds that are consistent with rape.

1634
01:23:56,530 --> 01:23:59,700
手腕上被捆的痕迹  还有我的精液
Ligature marks on her wrist, and my semen.

1635
01:23:59,740 --> 01:24:03,410
看起来就像我把艾米绑在床上  强奸了她
It looks like I've tied Amy to my bed, and raped her.

1636
01:24:03,450 --> 01:24:04,910
说是我干的
Me!

1637
01:24:04,960 --> 01:24:06,710
然后  猜猜他们找到了什么
And then, guess what they find.

他为什么去他爸爸的房子里烧日记本

那是私人房产  而且没有人在

1758
01:30:25,420 --> 01:30:28,220
他为什么没有确保日记被完全烧毁

1762
01:30:33,640 --> 01:30:35,730
比如发现写着"线索"的信封

01:31:18,720 --> 01:31:21,020
展示给大家  还变本加厉
of my infidelities. Rubbing my nose in it.

1782
01:31:21,060 --> 01:31:23,110
她把线索一的卡片留给警察
And she leaves clue number one for the police,

1783
01:31:23,140 --> 01:31:24,850
引他们去我的办公室
which will lead them back to my office,

1784
01:31:24,900 --> 01:31:27,440
而那正是我和安迪经常私会的地方
which is a place where Andie and I would often...

1785
01:31:27,480 --> 01:31:28,810
她还在那儿放了一条红色内裤
And she leaves a pair of red panties.

1786
01:31:28,860 --> 01:31:30,030
影响你的形象
Right. Racy, looks bad.

1787
01:31:30,070 --> 01:31:31,780
-线索二呢  -我爸爸的房子

1789
01:31:33,070 --> 01:31:34,200
偶尔发生关系的地方

1790
01:31:34,240 --> 01:31:35,620
-线索三呢  -在小木屋

1791

1792
01:31:37,200 --> 01:31:38,960
-我们没处可去  -去开房啊
- We had limited options. - A hotel.

1793
01:31:38,990 --> 01:31:40,430
艾米会看见信用卡账单
Amy would have seen the credit card bill.

1794
01:31:40,430 --> 01:31:41,490
那就用安迪的信用卡
Put it on Andie's credit card.

1795
01:31:41,540 --> 01:31:42,880
安迪的账单会直接传到她爸妈那儿
Andie's statement went right to her parents.

1796
01:31:42,910 --> 01:31:44,030
尼克  马尔

01:31:44,030 --> 01:31:45,450
我们能谈谈那个棕色房子吗

1798
01:31:45,500 --> 01:31:47,300
-它指的是哪儿  -我爸爸家

1799
01:31:47,340 --> 01:31:49,090
爸爸的房子是蓝色的
Dad's house is blue.

1800
01:31:50,380 --> 01:31:53,430
爸妈离婚之后  他不在我们身边
After the divorce, when dad wasn't coming around.

1801
01:31:53,760 --> 01:31:58,020
我一直都假装他是个间谍  叫布朗先生
I used to pretend that he was a spy named Mr. Brown, who...

1802
01:31:58,050 --> 01:32:00,170
为了确保他孩子的安全
For the sake of his children's safety,

1803
01:32:00,170 --> 01:32:01,720
不能与他们相认
had to deny their existence.

1804
01:32:01,770 --> 01:32:03,190
你从没跟我说过
You never told me that.

1805
01:32:03,430 --> 01:32:05,220
你竟然告诉她了
You told her that?

1806
01:32:05,270 --> 01:32:07,570
在办公室发现了可以让你定罪的红内裤
We've got incriminating red panties in your office.

1807
01:32:07,900 --> 01:32:10,300
你的小木屋里有一堆价值不菲的奢侈品
We've got a showcase showdown worth of crap in your woodshed.

1808
01:32:11,400 --> 01:32:13,820
那么  你爸爸的房子里到底有什么
So, what in God's name is at your father's house,

1809
01:32:13,820 --> 01:32:14,730
尼克
Nick?

1810
01:32:14,780 --> 01:32:15,870
实话实说
And be honest.

1811
01:32:15,910 --> 01:32:17,750
我真的不知道
I honestly have no idea.

1812
01:32:17,760 --> 01:32:19,050
案发现场 请勿进入

1813
01:32:24,910 --> 01:32:25,700
无论他们发现了什么
Whatever they found,

1814
01:32:25,700 --> 01:32:28,620
肯定不是什么好东西
I think it's safe to assume that it's very bad.

1815
01:32:30,460 --> 01:32:32,710
我们有太多不可控因素
We got a lot of uncontained issues here.

1816
01:32:32,960 --> 01:32:36,050
尼克  安迪现在是什么态度
Nick, do you have any idea as to what Andie's mindset is?

1817
01:32:37,260 --> 01:32:39,060
守夜之后我们还没联系过
Well, We haven't communicated since the vigil.

1818
01:32:39,100 --> 01:32:40,430
好吧  艾米的父母呢
Okay. Amy's parents?

1819
01:32:40,470 --> 01:32:42,050
-不好说  -更麻烦了
- No, it's... - More pressure.

1820
01:32:42,100 --> 01:32:42,850
我们有个硬伤
We got a hurt,

1821
01:32:42,850 --> 01:32:45,360
你的小女朋友随时都可能把事情公之于众
young girlfriend who will no doubt go public at any moment.

1822
01:32:45,390 --> 01:32:46,890
-不  安迪不会那么做  -她会的
- No, Andie won't do that. - She will.

1823
01:32:46,940 --> 01:32:48,650
这种女孩都会这么做  别感情用事
They always do. Don't take it personally.

1824
01:32:49,150 --> 01:32:51,320
艾米巧妙地把我们束缚住了
Amy's got us in an interesting bind.

1825
01:32:51,650 --> 01:32:53,420
我们得向警察坦白你和安迪的关系
We need to tell the cops about Andie.

1826
01:32:53,420 --> 01:32:53,950
不是吧
Really?

1827
01:32:53,990 --> 01:32:56,160
现在安迪的存在让你多了一个杀人动机
Right now, Andie just gives you another motive.

1828
01:32:56,990 --> 01:32:58,160
我们还要告诉警察小木屋的事
We need to tell the cops about the woodshed.

1829
01:32:58,450 --> 01:32:59,870
我们必须主动坦白
We need to be on the front end of that.

1830
01:32:59,910 --> 01:33:02,250
但是我要提醒你接下来会发生的事
But I'm gonna warn you as to what will happen.

1831
01:33:02,830 --> 01:33:04,040
他们会逮捕马尔
They'll go after Margo.

1832
01:33:04,080 --> 01:33:05,080
他们没权这样做  能吗
They can't do that, can they?

1833
01:33:05,120 --> 01:33:07,030
她是你的共犯  帮你隐藏了证据
She's your accomplice. She helped you hide the evidence.

1834
01:33:07,080 --> 01:33:09,160
看起来她知道你杀了艾米
In all likelihood, she knows that you killed Amy.

1835
01:33:10,080 --> 01:33:11,500
天啊
God.

1836
01:33:11,840 --> 01:33:13,930
那我们该怎么做
Well, what are we going to do?

1837
01:33:13,960 --> 01:33:14,960
我们得找到艾米
We find Amy.

1838
01:33:15,260 --> 01:33:17,600
不  其他策略都忽略了重点
No. Any other strategy is missing the point.

1839
01:33:17,630 --> 01:33:19,960
我认识两个前特工哥们  很能干
I've got two ex-secret service guys that are really good.

1841
01:33:21,680 --> 01:33:23,100
但是该从哪儿开始找  尼克
But where do they start, Nick?

1842
01:33:23,470 --> 01:33:24,590
艾米会去哪儿
Where would Amy go?

1843
01:33:26,770 --> 01:33:28,400
不知道
I have no idea.

1844
01:33:32,860 --> 01:33:35,490
我们记分吗
Are we keeping score?

1845
01:33:36,150 --> 01:33:37,520
喂
Hey!

1846
01:33:39,160 --> 01:33:42,330
我还以为我们最近对男性敬而远之呢
I thought we were steering clear of men for a while.

1847
01:33:42,370 --> 01:33:43,370
他人很好
He's nice.

1848
01:33:43,370 --> 01:33:45,870
因为他想干你
Because he wants to fuck you.

1849
01:33:47,500 --> 01:33:49,040
她还在为前任而苦恼吗
She's still moping about her ex?

1850
01:33:50,830 --> 01:33:53,500
他也被背叛过
He got cheated on, too.

1851
01:33:56,880 --> 01:33:59,750
我们三个是欧扎克最悲伤的人
We three are the saddest sacks in all the Ozarks.

1852
01:33:59,800 --> 01:34:01,340
我不悲伤
I'm not sad.

1853
01:34:01,890 --> 01:34:02,890
我是生气
I'm angry.

1854

我被老婆抛弃那时都要宿醉而死了

1856
01:34:07,390 --> 01:34:09,640
我想要自杀  你信吗
I was gonna kill myself. Can you believe that?

1857
01:34:09,690 --> 01:34:10,820
别便宜了他
Don't give him the pleasure.

1858
01:34:10,850 --> 01:34:13,980
我想把自己淹死在墨西哥湾

成为大白鲨的美餐

1861
01:34:18,400 --> 01:34:22,320
为什么要死的是我  我又不是那个混蛋

1862
01:34:22,370 --> 01:34:24,830
应该把这话印在T恤上

1863

土豪小姐  你不是说你破产了吗

零头  你做什么的  脱衣舞娘
Singles? What are you, a stripper?

1867
01:34:44,850 --> 01:34:47,440
应召女郎  还是"口"艺高超
Swamp girls, or treasure chest?

1868
01:34:48,560 --> 01:34:49,610
我们逗你玩呢
We're just teasing.

1869
01:34:50,390 --> 01:34:52,180
你们在新奥尔良不开玩笑的吗

尼克·邓恩随时都可能被捕

看看她裙子底下
Look under her dress.

1926
01:38:25,640 --> 01:38:27,600
但喊你名字你总是没反应
but you don't even answer to it half the time.

1927
01:38:27,650 --> 01:38:28,290
你在躲避什么
You're hiding.

1928
01:38:28,290 --> 01:38:30,110
我不知道为什么  也不关心这个
I don't know why, and I don't really care.

1929
01:38:30,150 --> 01:38:32,190
但是你绝对不会报警
But you ain't gonna call the cops.

1930
01:38:32,530 --> 01:38:34,610
而且我觉得你也没被虐待过
And I don't think you've ever really been hit before.

1931
01:38:40,830 --> 01:38:42,830
我靠
Holy shit.

1932
01:38:45,880 --> 01:38:48,680
抱歉  我们真的很需要钱
Sorry, but we really need the money.

1933
01:38:48,710 --> 01:38:50,340
下次一定多加小心  明白吗
Next place, be more careful, okay?

1934
01:38:50,380 --> 01:38:52,740
外面有很多比我们还坏的人
There are a lot of people out there a lot worse than we are.

1935
01:39:27,340 --> 01:39:28,970
抱歉  你不能在这儿睡觉
Excuse me. You can't sleep here.

1936
01:39:54,380 --> 01:39:56,570
七月十二日 失踪七天后

1937
01:39:56,570 --> 01:39:57,420
我没有杀害我的妻子
I did not kill my wife.
七月十二日 失踪七天后

1938
01:39:57,420 --> 01:39:59,660
我没有杀害我的妻子
I did not kill my wife.

1939
01:40:00,660 --> 01:40:03,950
再来一遍吧  别那么愣
Why don't you try it again? A little less wooden.

1940
01:40:04,000 --> 01:40:05,090
我没杀我妻子
I didn't kill my wife.

1941
01:40:06,920 --> 01:40:08,630
-干嘛  -你每次表现得自以为是
- What are you doing? - Every time you look smug,

1942
01:40:08,670 --> 01:40:10,060
生闷气  或者紧张的时候
or annoyed or tense,

1943
01:40:10,060 --> 01:40:11,340
我就拿小熊软糖扔你
I'm gonna hit you with a gummy bear.

1944
01:40:11,380 --> 01:40:12,570
难道这能缓解我紧绷的神经吗
That's supposed to make me less tense?

1945
01:40:12,570 --> 01:40:13,340
我们再来一遍
Let's try it again.

1946
01:40:13,380 --> 01:40:15,050
邓恩先生  据我了解
Mr. Dunne, from what I understand,

1947
01:40:15,050 --> 01:40:16,670
你和你的妻子有些矛盾
you and your wife had some bumps.

1948
01:40:17,720 --> 01:40:20,550
是  我们这几年过得不是很顺利
Yeah, we had some tough years.

1949
01:40:20,550 --> 01:40:21,680
我失业了
I lost my job.

1950
01:40:21,720 --> 01:40:22,720
是你们都失业了
You both did.

1951
01:40:25,440 --> 01:40:27,320
我们都失业了
We both lost our jobs.

1952
01:40:27,360 --> 01:40:29,900
我们不得不回老家照顾我母亲
I had to move back home so we could take care of my mother,

1953
01:40:29,940 --> 01:40:32,480
她癌症晚期  我的爸爸...
who was dying of cancer and my dad, who had...

1954
01:40:32,530 --> 01:40:34,280
你爸爸提不得
your dad's scorched earth.

1955
01:40:34,320 --> 01:40:35,990
尽量谈你的母亲  说说你们的关系
Let's talk about your mom, how close you were.

1956
01:40:36,030 --> 01:40:37,190
接着说
Go on.

1957
01:40:37,240 --> 01:40:39,750
时间一久  就会积累矛盾
For a while, things had been building up.

1958
01:40:39,780 --> 01:40:43,280
"积累"让人感觉要爆发  不能这么说
"Built up" implies that an explosion is coming. No.

1959
01:40:43,330 --> 01:40:45,750
可以说  我们的婚姻走上了错误的轨道
At a certain point, we got on the wrong track.

1960
01:40:46,580 --> 01:40:48,200
我一时懦弱
I had a moment of weakness.

1961
01:40:48,250 --> 01:40:50,660
你的"一时"可是持续了十五个多月
Your "Moment" Was over 15 months.

1962
01:40:54,470 --> 01:40:56,560
我对妻子很无礼
I disrespected my wife.

1963
01:40:57,220 --> 01:40:59,640
对婚姻不重视
And I disrespected my marriage.

1964
01:41:00,100 --> 01:41:01,480
我一直都很后悔
And I'll always regret it.

1965
01:41:02,220 --> 01:41:03,050
这话管用
That works.

1966
01:41:03,100 --> 01:41:05,520
别怕表现得像个愚蠢的老公  尼克
Don't be afraid to play up the dufus husband thing, Nick.

1967
01:41:05,560 --> 01:41:07,270
我就是个傻瓜  我糟透了
I was an idiot. I'm a fuck-up.

1968
01:41:07,310 --> 01:41:08,140
我做的一切都是错的
Everything I do is wrong."

1969
01:41:08,190 --> 01:41:10,240
我懂男人都需要怎么做
I know. What men are supposed to do in general.

1970
01:41:12,360 --> 01:41:13,410
-谢了  -你感觉怎么样
- Thank you. - How do you feel?

1971
01:41:13,440 --> 01:41:16,650
感觉不错  能递给我那个盒子吗
I feel good. Go, can you pass me that box, please?

1972
01:41:17,070 --> 01:41:19,690
这是艾米在我三十三岁生日时送的礼物
It's Amy's 33rd birthday present to me.

1973
01:41:19,740 --> 01:41:20,740
你不喜欢这手表
You hate that watch.

1974
01:41:20,780 --> 01:41:22,860
不  我喜欢
No, go. I love that watch.

1975
01:41:22,910 --> 01:41:24,910
就像我喜欢这条领带
Just like I love this tie.

1976
01:41:24,950 --> 01:41:28,080
就像我爱我的妻子
Just like I love my wife.

1977
01:41:42,610 --> 01:41:44,030
赌场

1978
01:41:58,450 --> 01:41:59,830
你来了
It's you!

1979
01:41:59,860 --> 01:42:01,860
真是你
It's you.

1980
01:42:02,700 --> 01:42:04,700
对不起
I'm sorry.

1981
01:42:05,370 --> 01:42:06,710
对不起
I'm sorry.

1982
01:42:07,620 --> 01:42:09,620
天啊
Good God.

1983
01:42:09,670 --> 01:42:11,050
上周
Last week,

1984
01:42:11,540 --> 01:42:13,660
我威胁他说我要离开
I threatened to leave,

1985
01:42:13,660 --> 01:42:16,710
他说要找到我并且杀了我
and he said he'd find me and he'd kill me.

1986
01:42:17,050 --> 01:42:19,220
所以我才消失掉
So, I disappeared.

1987
01:42:20,380 --> 01:42:22,210
我流产了
I lost the baby.

1988
01:42:22,720 --> 01:42:24,510
我甚至都不敢告诉父母
I couldn't even tell my parents.

1989
01:42:24,560 --> 01:42:28,480
我感到很羞耻  也很害怕
I'm so ashamed and I'm so afraid.

1990
01:42:29,230 --> 01:42:30,400
他在找你
Well, he is looking for you.

1991
01:42:31,060 --> 01:42:33,020
三天前他来过我家
He showed up on my doorstep three days ago.

1992
01:42:33,060 --> 01:42:35,560
他看见我给你的信就找过来了
He tracked me from my letters to you.

1993
01:42:36,690 --> 01:42:37,900
你还留着那些信
You saved them.

1994
01:42:38,490 --> 01:42:39,530
你的存在
Knowing you were out there,

1995
01:42:39,570 --> 01:42:42,190
是这几年来唯一支撑我的事
was the only thing that's kept me going these past few years.

1996
01:42:42,240 --> 01:42:43,620
我们报警吧  你可以说明一切
Let's go to the police. You can explain everything.

1997
01:42:43,660 --> 01:42:44,960
不  我现在不能露面
No, I can't turn up now.

1998
01:42:44,990 --> 01:42:48,070
我会很难堪  人人都会瞧不起我
I'd be a pariah. Everyone would hate me.

1999
01:42:49,910 --> 01:42:52,200
我想让尼克蹲监狱是不是错了
Is it wrong to want Nick to go to prison?

2000
01:42:52,250 --> 01:42:54,090
他应该为他所做的进监狱
He should go to prison for what he's done.

2001
01:42:56,920 --> 01:42:59,380
我把你安顿在我的湖边小屋
I'm setting you up at my lake house.

2002
01:42:59,420 --> 01:43:00,420
那里非常隐蔽
It's utterly secluded.

2003
01:43:01,840 --> 01:43:03,670
你为什么对我这么好
Why are you so good to me?

2004
01:43:03,720 --> 01:43:05,060
你知道原因

01:43:05,100 --> 01:43:06,230
打扰一下
Excuse me.

2006
01:43:06,260 --> 01:43:07,380
我们见过  对吧
I know you, don't I?

01:43:07,430 --> 01:43:08,220
不
No.

2008

你是那个新奥尔良姑娘  对吗
You're one of the Nolan girls, right?

No, I had some gummy bears.

2021
01:43:34,040 --> 01:43:35,620
搞什么
What the fuck?

2022
01:43:36,790 --> 01:43:37,920
怎么了

我们关于了不起的艾米失踪一案

我的天
Oh, my God.

我叫安迪·菲茨杰拉德

我在学校认识了尼古拉斯·邓恩

2030
01:43:54,690 --> 01:43:58,320
他是我的创意写作老师
when he was my creative writing teacher at Mill Valley.

2031
01:43:58,360 --> 01:44:00,450
她为什么穿得像个保姆
Why is she dressed like a babysitter?

2032
01:44:00,480 --> 01:44:01,940
我非常惭愧
I am deeply ashamed...

2033
01:44:01,990 --> 01:44:05,120
与已婚男人发展恋爱关系
of having been romantically involved with a married man.

2034
01:44:05,160 --> 01:44:07,080
这个大胸骚货
The girl with the giant cum-on-me tits.

2035
01:44:07,120 --> 01:44:09,120
我以为我们是真爱
I truly believed we were in love.

2036
01:44:09,160 --> 01:44:11,000
现在开始装圣女了
Now, she looks like a fucking mennonite.

2037
01:44:12,500 --> 01:44:13,960
我知道这种事没有借口
I know that is no excuse.

2038
01:44:14,000 --> 01:44:15,300
对  没借口
No, it is not.

2039
01:44:15,330 --> 01:44:16,780
在我心里
I do not, in my heart,

2040
01:44:16,780 --> 01:44:19,670
我不认为尼克·邓恩会为我而杀人
believe Nick Dunne would have killed for me.

2041
01:44:19,710 --> 01:44:22,130
我为每个关心艾米的人祈祷

2043

我们待尼克·邓恩如亲生儿子

但从今往后 恩断义绝
That love ended today.

2045
01:44:34,850 --> 01:44:36,470
走吧  他们看起来很不好
Come on, you're staring at ghosts.

2046
01:44:36,520 --> 01:44:39,180
他用无尽的谎言回报我们的信任
He met our trust with lie after lie.

2047
01:44:39,520 --> 01:44:41,440
我们现在坚定地相信
We now absolutely believe,

2048
01:44:41,480 --> 01:44:43,860
尼克与我们女儿的失踪有很大关系
Nick is involved in the disappearance of our daughter.

2049
01:44:43,900 --> 01:44:46,150
我们的了不起的艾米
Our amazing Amy.

2050
01:44:47,030 --> 01:44:49,150
真是个劲爆的消息
Well, this just got very exciting.

2051
01:44:49,870 --> 01:44:51,580
我们需要点时间
We need a moment.

2052
01:44:53,580 --> 01:44:55,340
我们得取消访谈
We're gonna have to bow out of this.

2053
01:44:55,370 --> 01:44:57,170
-什么都没变  -一切都变了
- Nothing has changed. - Everything has changed.

2054
01:44:57,210 --> 01:44:57,810
一小时之间
An hour ago,

2055
01:44:57,810 --> 01:44:59,630
我们还掌握主动权  现在呢
we were ahead of this. Now?

2056
01:44:59,670 --> 01:45:01,310
-我能处理好  -我们是被动的
- I can handle this. - We're on the defense.

2057
01:45:01,340 --> 01:45:03,390
现在的事态完全不同了
This is a completely different dynamic.

2058
01:45:03,420 --> 01:45:06,170
-我能处理好  -她能活剥了你
- I can handle it. - She's going to eat you alive.

2059
01:45:06,720 --> 01:45:08,390
相信我
Just trust me.

2060
01:45:12,770 --> 01:45:14,150

Mic him.

2063

谢谢
Thank you.

2065
01:45:47,590 --> 01:45:48,880
他不该对化妆师微笑
He shouldn't smile at the makeup artist.

2066
01:45:48,930 --> 01:45:49,930
就是  呵呵
Yeah, no kidding.

2067
01:45:54,600 --> 01:45:57,730
准备  五  四
Roll tape. Five, four,

2068
01:45:57,770 --> 01:45:59,400
三  二
three, two...

2069
01:46:01,610 --> 01:46:04,530
说真的  我都不敢相信你表现得这么好
Seriously, I can't believe how fucking good you were.

2070
01:46:04,570 --> 01:46:05,520
是艾米激发出了我的潜能
Amy brings out the best in me.

2071
01:46:05,520 --> 01:46:06,030
别这么说
Don't.

2072
01:46:06,070 --> 01:46:07,080
你们两个别放松
Keep it together, you two.

2073
01:46:07,080 --> 01:46:09,240
至少在接下来的二十四小时里
At least for the next 24 hours.

2074
01:46:09,280 --> 01:46:10,050
大家仍然不喜欢你
People still hate you.

2075
01:46:10,060 --> 01:46:11,700
女人都恨不得把你眼珠子挖出来
Women want to scratch your eyes out.

胡说

那条领带是我买的

我没有杀我妻子

2156
01:51:17,670 --> 01:51:19,210
我不是杀人犯
I am not a murderer.

2157
01:51:19,260 --> 01:51:21,180
但是你出轨了
But you were unfaithful.

2158
01:51:21,220 --> 01:51:23,430
我是出轨了
I was unfaithful.

2159
01:51:23,470 --> 01:51:25,140
我也感到很羞愧
And I am deeply ashamed.

2160
01:51:25,180 --> 01:51:27,520
更严重的是  你让艾米的父母
And, on top of that, you allowed Amy's parents,

2161
01:51:27,810 --> 01:51:30,560
她的朋友  以及你镇上的所有人

2165
01:51:37,480 --> 01:51:38,640
说是这么说  不过我很好奇
You say that, but I'm wondering,

2166
01:51:38,640 --> 01:51:40,480
你要怎么让我们相信你
how you expect us to believe you.

2167
01:51:40,530 --> 01:51:42,240
我们现在知道你是个骗子
Now that we know you're a liar.

2168
01:51:42,530 --> 01:51:45,660
我之前没承认自己有外遇
I didn't come forward with my affair.

2169
01:51:45,700 --> 01:51:48,870
因为我知道  这会让我看起来坏得无可救药
Because I knew it would make me look really, really bad.

2170
01:51:49,700 --> 01:51:51,490
但我已经不在乎了

我只是想找到我的妻子

2172
01:51:53,210 --> 01:51:55,760
-我只是想搞清楚  -让我给你说清楚
- I'm just trying to get clear... - let me be clear.

2173
01:51:55,790 --> 01:52:00,210
我虽然不是个杀人犯  我也不是个好人
Just because I am not a murderer doesn't make me a good guy.

2174
01:52:00,260 --> 01:52:01,430
我不是个好人
I'm not a good guy.

2175
01:52:01,840 --> 01:52:04,300
我是一位好妻子的坏丈夫
I was a bad husband to a great wife.

2176
01:52:04,680 --> 01:52:06,430
我打破了对她的誓言
I broke the vow that I made to her.

2177
01:52:06,680 --> 01:52:09,230
说得真好  尼克
Those are pretty words, Nick.

2178
01:52:09,560 --> 01:52:11,310
但这对你来说到底意味着什么
But what does that really mean to you?

2179
01:52:11,350 --> 01:52:13,390
我是个彻头彻尾的骗子
It basically means that I was a con artist.

2180
01:52:14,350 --> 01:52:17,560
七年前  我遇到艾米·艾略特
I met Amy Elliott seven years ago.

我完全被迷住了
I was completely transfixed.

2182
01:52:19,650 --> 01:52:21,560
艾米非常迷人
Amy can do that to you.

2183
01:52:21,610 --> 01:52:24,150
我只是一个普通的男人
I was this average guy from an average place.

2184
01:52:24,200 --> 01:52:26,200
怀揣着一丝梦想
with mediocre aspirations.

2185
01:52:26,240 --> 01:52:28,740
我遇到了一个让我为之倾倒的女人
And I met a woman who dazzled me.

2186
01:52:28,780 --> 01:52:30,740
我希望得到她的爱
And I wanted her to love me.

2187
01:52:30,790 --> 01:52:33,130
所以我假装自己很优秀
So I pretended to be better than I was.

2188
01:52:34,000 --> 01:52:37,670
在我们结婚时  我承诺会成为那样的人
When we got married, I promised to be that guy.

2189
01:52:37,710 --> 01:52:39,540
一个勤奋工作的人
That guy who works harder.

2190
01:52:39,590 --> 01:52:41,800
一个跟她一样  努力向上
That guy who, who lives and acts,

2191
01:52:41,840 --> 01:52:44,760
用尽全力去爱的人
and loves with as much passion as she does.

2192
01:52:45,010 --> 01:52:46,220
但我让她失望了
But I failed her.

2193
01:52:47,140 --> 01:52:48,500
我没有正确处理事情
Instead of doing what was right.

2194
01:52:49,760 --> 01:52:50,930
我选择了逃避
I did what was easy.

2195
01:52:51,680 --> 01:52:55,310
你说得好像你的妻子能起死回生
You talk like a man who believes he can make amends to his wife.

2196
01:52:55,350 --> 01:52:56,970
还活着似的
Who believes his wife is still alive.

2197
01:52:57,020 --> 01:52:58,310
她的确还活着
She is still alive.

2198
01:53:00,190 --> 01:53:03,020
你能看着镜头吗
Will you look at that camera for me?

2199
01:53:03,360 --> 01:53:06,320
看着镜头
Will you look in the lens,

2200
01:53:06,360 --> 01:53:08,320
跟你的妻子说话
and talk to your wife?

2201
01:53:08,370 --> 01:53:11,460
如果她依然活着  能看到你今晚的采访
If she is out there, able to hear and see you tonight.

2202
01:53:11,490 --> 01:53:14,160
你会对她说什么  尼克
What would you like to say to her, Nick?

2203
01:53:17,710 --> 01:53:20,010
艾米  我爱你
Amy, I love you.

2204
01:53:20,710 --> 01:53:23,500
你是我见过最棒的人
You're the best person I've ever known.

2205
01:53:23,550 --> 01:53:25,310
我已经对我的所作所为

2206
01:53:25,310 --> 01:53:28,020
感到无比后悔
woodshed for the way that I've treated you.

2207
01:53:28,050 --> 01:53:30,010
如果你能回来  我保证
And if you come back, I promise,

2208
01:53:30,050 --> 01:53:32,550
我会花一辈子的时间去弥补你
I will spend every day making it up to you.

2209

我会成为我承诺的完美男人
I will be the man that I promised you I would be.

2210
01:53:39,480 --> 01:53:40,480
我爱你

01:53:41,400 --> 01:53:42,990
回家吧
Come home.

2212
01:53:47,740 --> 01:53:48,740
给我

不管你怎么想
Regardless of what you thought,

2214
01:53:56,540 --> 01:53:58,710
怎么样
What does it say?

2215

我想我们都同意
I think we can all agree,

2216
01:54:00,330 --> 01:54:01,830
天啊  你太厉害了
Oh, my God. You fucking killed it.

事情远远没那么简单
there's more to him than meets the eye.

2218
01:54:03,090 --> 01:54:04,210
他们都为你疯狂
They're going crazy for you.

2219
01:54:04,210 --> 01:54:08,710
他们从不喜欢我  喜欢我  恨我
They disliked me, they liked me, they hated me,

2220
01:54:08,760 --> 01:54:10,390
变成了爱我
and now they love me.

2221
01:54:10,430 --> 01:54:13,390
坦诚的人值得尊重
A candor and an honesty that's worthy of respect.

2222
01:54:13,430 --> 01:54:15,340
很显然  他赢得了我的尊重
He's certainly earned mine.

2223
01:54:16,180 --> 01:54:17,260

Margo Dunne, this is a search warrant for your property.

2226
01:54:31,030 --> 01:54:33,240
我通常会忽略爆料电话
I usually ignore tipline calls.

2227
01:54:33,280 --> 01:54:35,150
但有邻居看到陌生男子
But a neighbor was concerned

2228
01:54:35,150 --> 01:54:37,870
在你的小木屋附近游荡
about a strange man around your woodshed.

2229
01:54:38,290 --> 01:54:39,290
打给坦纳
Call Tanner.

2230
01:54:39,290 --> 01:54:40,460
该死的
Okay. Fuck!

2231
01:54:44,590 --> 01:54:46,050
你的女朋友很可爱  尼克
Girlfriend's real cute, Nick.

2232
01:54:47,300 --> 01:54:48,380
是因为这件事吗
Is that what this is about?

2233
01:54:49,800 --> 01:54:52,300
整个调查中
I have treated you more than fair

2234
01:54:52,300 --> 01:54:54,550
我都对你很公平
throughout this entire investigation.

2235
01:54:54,600 --> 01:54:56,900
我一次又一次给你机会坦白
I gave you the benefit of the doubt over and over.

2236
01:54:56,930 --> 01:54:58,430
每次你说了愚蠢的话
Every time you said something stupid.

2237
01:54:58,480 --> 01:55:00,860
我就想  他只是蠢而已
I thought, "Maybe he's just stupid."

2238
01:55:00,900 --> 01:55:03,440
但我错了  事情原来是这样的
But I was wrong. That's what this is about.

2239
01:55:03,480 --> 01:55:04,600
这些就是你不用的高尔夫球杆吗
Are these the clubs you don't play golf with?

2240
01:55:04,650 --> 01:55:05,650
那些全都不是我的
None of that is mine.

2241
01:55:05,940 --> 01:55:07,520
也不是我放在这里的
None of this was put here by me.

2242
01:55:07,570 --> 01:55:08,920
很不错的球杆
Those are nice clubs.

2243
01:55:08,920 --> 01:55:11,120
好一个男人的密室
You got the makings of a real man cave.

2244
01:55:11,160 --> 01:55:14,290
就等着妻子永远消失了
Everything just waiting until the wife goes away for good.

2245
01:55:14,330 --> 01:55:15,410
尼克
Nick!

2246
01:55:16,660 --> 01:55:19,580
-你们不能这样做  -我们当然可以
- You can't do that! - Of course we can.

2247
01:55:27,880 --> 01:55:30,460
艾米  是时候重新开始了
Amy, it's time to move on.

2248
01:55:30,510 --> 01:55:32,220
我有什么能帮忙的吗
What can I do to help?

2249
01:55:32,930 --> 01:55:34,480
我需要时间考虑
I need some time to think.

2250
01:55:34,510 --> 01:55:37,010
-这是你最不需要的  -德西
- That's the last thing you need. - Desi.

2251
01:55:37,060 --> 01:55:39,650
二十年来  你一直让我等
Twenty years, you have kept me dangling.

2252
01:55:39,680 --> 01:55:43,350
你昨晚终于来见我了  你选择了我
Finally, last night, you came to me, and you chose me.

2253
01:55:44,060 --> 01:55:45,390
跟着昨晚的直觉走
Follow that instinct.

2254
01:55:45,440 --> 01:55:47,600
不要再让自己挨打
Don't trust the instinct that left you beaten,

2255
01:55:47,600 --> 01:55:51,570
睡在车里无家可归  担惊受怕
and homeless, sleeping in your car, fearing for your life.

2256
01:55:54,910 --> 01:55:57,620
我不会强迫你
I'm not gonna force myself on you.

2257
01:56:00,040 --> 01:56:02,710
你说的我都懂  德西
I understand what you're saying, Desi.

2258
01:56:03,960 --> 01:56:05,590
我真的懂
I do.

2259
01:56:07,120 --> 01:56:11,580
我被长时间虐待
Just been... I've been so mistreated for so long.

2260
01:56:13,590 --> 01:56:16,470
都忘了如何处事
I've forgotten how to behave.

2261
01:56:22,230 --> 01:56:24,530
我明天会搬进来
I'll move in here tomorrow.

2262
01:56:24,560 --> 01:56:27,140
我们一起想办法解决
And we'll work it out together.

2263
01:56:29,230 --> 01:56:32,940
我只想要你做回自己
I just want you to be you again.

2264
01:56:40,790 --> 01:56:42,310
他们抓走马尔是为了吓唬你
They only took Margo to fuck with you.

2265
01:56:42,330 --> 01:56:44,040
我不能让她在那里多待一秒
She's not spending another fucking second in there.

2266
01:56:44,080 --> 01:56:46,830
我要进去告诉他们真相
I'm gonna go in, and I'm gonna tell them everything.

2267
01:56:47,500 --> 01:56:49,250
怎么了
What?

2268
01:56:51,260 --> 01:56:52,890
我们只能跟邦妮透漏一点
We tell Boney very little.

2269
01:56:52,920 --> 01:56:55,050
没有尸体  没有凶器
Without a body, without a murder weapon.

2270
01:56:55,090 --> 01:56:57,380
他们只能期望你认罪
Their only hope is a confession.

2271
01:56:57,430 --> 01:56:59,390
把说话权让给他们
So, you let them do all the talking.

2272
01:56:59,430 --> 01:57:01,550
那我们就有时间组织你的辩词
That way, we can jump-start your defense.

2273
01:57:01,600 --> 01:57:03,980
真相就是我的辩词
The truth is my defense.

2274
01:57:09,940 --> 01:57:10,940
认得它们吗
Recognize these?

2275
01:57:10,940 --> 01:57:13,060
艾米送我的周年纪念日礼物
Yes. It's Amy's anniversary present to me.

2276
01:57:13,110 --> 01:57:14,900
她是通过这些告诉你她怀孕的吗  尼克
Was that how she told you she was pregnant, Nick?

2277
01:57:14,950 --> 01:57:17,450
妈妈爸爸孩子  这就让你生气了吗
Mommy, daddy, baby, and that made you real mad?

2278
01:57:17,950 --> 01:57:19,120
不
No.

2279
01:57:20,370 --> 01:57:22,490
-认得这个吗  -从未见过
- Recognize this? - Never seen that before in my life.

2280
01:57:22,700 --> 01:57:25,950
这是艾米的日记  在你爸爸家里找到的
It's Amy's diary. We found this at your father's house.

2281
01:57:27,960 --> 01:57:29,260
这是你妻子的笔迹吗
Is this your wife's handwriting?

2282
01:57:29,290 --> 01:57:31,290
-他又不是鉴定专...  -看上去是
- He's not a handwriting ex... - looks like it.

2283
01:57:31,340 --> 01:57:32,470
我们的专家也这样认为
Our experts thought so, too.

2284
01:57:33,800 --> 01:57:35,940
我们来玩个是真还是假的游戏
Do you wanna play a little true or false?

2285
01:57:36,260 --> 01:57:37,470
没问题
Sure.

2286
01:57:37,510 --> 01:57:41,980
"他抹掉我嘴唇上的糖霜  吻了我"
"And then he brushes the sugar off my lips so he can taste me."

2287
01:57:43,100 --> 01:57:45,110
真的
Yeah, that's true.

2288
01:57:46,350 --> 01:57:48,350
你还以为藜麦是种鱼
You thought quinoa was a fish?

2289
01:57:49,650 --> 01:57:50,990
这也是真的
That is also true, yes.

2290
01:57:53,150 --> 01:57:55,270
她想要孩子  你攻击了她
She wanted to get pregnant, you assaulted her.

2291
01:57:55,320 --> 01:57:57,330
我打了她  从来没有
I hit her? No, never happened.

2292
01:57:57,360 --> 01:57:58,980
-这里说的是推  -完全没有
- "Pushed," It says "Pushed." - Absolutely not.

2293
01:57:59,030 --> 01:58:00,110
我从来没碰过她
I never touched her.

2294
01:58:02,540 --> 01:58:04,170
她试图去买枪
She tried to buy a gun.

2295
01:58:04,830 --> 01:58:06,710
不会吧  不过我也不知道
I doubt that, but I don't know.

2296
01:58:08,120 --> 01:58:09,750
我要读下最后一句吗
Shall I read the last entry?

2297
01:58:09,790 --> 01:58:10,830
读吧
Sure.

2298
01:58:12,130 --> 01:58:14,260
"这男人可能会杀了我"
"This man may kill me."

2299
01:58:14,300 --> 01:58:16,510
她的原话  "这男人可能会杀了我"
In her own words, "This man may kill me."

2300
01:58:16,550 --> 01:58:18,680
就是个简单的尾注罢了
It's kind of a convenient end note.

2301
01:58:25,180 --> 01:58:26,600
以备日后参考
For future reference.

2302
01:58:26,640 --> 01:58:28,970
记住  你不是笔迹鉴定专家
The truth, you are not a handwriting expert.

2303
01:58:29,020 --> 01:58:30,070
我知道了
Okay, I know.

2304
01:58:38,490 --> 01:58:40,330
朱蒂失踪的手柄
Judy's missing handle.

2305
01:58:41,870 --> 01:58:44,160
宽四寸厚二尺  跟球杆一样大
Big as a two-by-four, right? Big as a club.

2306
01:58:44,200 --> 01:58:46,950
我们第一天在你家办公室的壁炉里找到的
We found this day one, in the fireplace in your home office.

2307
01:58:47,000 --> 01:58:48,020
我们一开始不知道是什么
We didn't know what the hell it was,

2308
01:58:48,020 --> 01:58:49,670
但七月里生火吗
but fire in July?

2309
01:58:49,710 --> 01:58:50,550
我们把它包了起来
We bagged it.

2310
01:58:50,580 --> 01:58:51,700
我也从未见过
I've never seen that before either.

2311
01:58:51,750 --> 01:58:54,370
我们验过了  火是抹不去血迹的  尼克
We just tested it. Fire doesn't erase blood, Nick.

2312
01:58:54,420 --> 01:58:56,630
尼古拉斯·邓恩
So, finally, Nicholas Dunne,

2313
01:58:56,670 --> 01:58:58,290
你因杀害你妻子而被捕
you're under arrest for the murder of your wife.

2314
01:58:58,340 --> 01:58:59,550
别说话
Do not say another word.

2315
01:58:59,590 --> 01:59:00,920
-不听听我的辩词吗  -尼克
- What about my side? - Nick!

2316
01:59:06,700 --> 01:59:09,740
七月二十六日 失踪二十一天后

2317
01:59:14,270 --> 01:59:15,730
还要咖啡吗
More coffee?

2318
01:59:15,780 --> 01:59:17,570
好的
I'd love it.

2319

记得以前我们逃课去的那个岬角吗

2320

当然  现捞的龙虾

德西  我怎么会无聊呢
Desi, how could I be bored?

2325
01:59:35,250 --> 01:59:37,710
你可以谈论十八世纪的交响乐
You can discuss 18th-century symphonies.

2326

十九世纪的印象派

年轻人都这样穿
That's how the kids wear it.

2336
02:01:22,860 --> 02:01:26,690
邓恩  有律师要见你

坦纳  有任何艾米的消息吗

我的两个得力助手在查

有种你就回家  艾米
Come home, Amy. I dare you.

Are we pals again?

2376
02:06:49,520 --> 02:06:53,060
我知道你没杀你的妻子  所以是的
Now that I know you didn't murder your wife, yes.

2377
02:06:53,110 --> 02:06:54,110
你怎么看
What do you think?

2378
02:06:54,110 --> 02:06:57,030
绑架  这故事太扯了
Kidnapping? The story's insane.

2379
02:06:59,200 --> 02:07:01,660
她吃了好多止痛药
She's on fairly heavy painkillers.

2380
02:07:01,700 --> 02:07:03,620
没关系  我想帮忙
It's okay. I want to help.

2381
02:07:03,660 --> 02:07:05,080
邓恩女士  我知道你受了不少苦
Ms. Dunne, I know what you've been through

2382
02:07:05,120 --> 02:07:07,460
所以我们会尽量简短
so we'll keep this very brief.

2383
02:07:07,500 --> 02:07:09,880
你能给我们讲一下事发经过吗
Can you walk us through what happened?

2384
02:07:12,500 --> 02:07:15,120
那天早晨我听到门铃响
That morning, the doorbell rang.

2385
02:07:16,010 --> 02:07:18,010
很正常
So normal.

2386
02:07:18,050 --> 02:07:19,890
于是我打开了门
I opened the door.

2387
02:07:20,510 --> 02:07:22,350
好奇怪
So strange.

2388
02:07:22,970 --> 02:07:26,590
从高中起  他就不肯放过我
Since high school, he won't ever go away.

2389
02:07:26,640 --> 02:07:29,720
而我只是不想伤害他
And I've just tried to be nice to him.

2390
02:07:29,770 --> 02:07:31,400
于是我给他回信
Answer his letters.

2391
02:07:31,650 --> 02:07:33,650
让他保持冷静
Keep him calm.

2392
02:07:35,070 --> 02:07:36,530
天啊
Oh, my God.

2393
02:07:37,150 --> 02:07:38,770
是我鼓励了他的行为
I've encouraged him.

2394
02:07:38,820 --> 02:07:40,620
你不能怪自己
You can't blame yourself.

2395
02:07:42,240 --> 02:07:44,410
他推开门进了屋
He pushed inside.

2396
02:07:45,990 --> 02:07:48,030
然后就抓住我
And he grabbed me.

2397
02:07:48,750 --> 02:07:51,840
但我挣脱了  跑到了厨房
But I got away, and ran to the kitchen.

2398
02:07:52,170 --> 02:07:53,880
他用棒子打我
And he clubbed me.

2399
02:07:54,340 --> 02:07:55,760
我跌倒了
I collapsed.

2400
02:07:55,800 --> 02:07:59,850
那根棍子实际上是一个潘趣和朱迪玩偶的手柄
That club was actually the handle to a Punch and Judy puppet.

2401
02:07:59,880 --> 02:08:01,300
没错
Right.

2402
02:08:02,220 --> 02:08:03,640
寻宝游戏
Treasure hunt.

2403
02:08:05,560 --> 02:08:07,600
我在马尔家藏了一些玩偶
I'd hidden some puppets at Go's...

2404
02:08:07,640 --> 02:08:09,360
那这个手柄怎么会落在德西手里呢
Then how did Desi have that handle?

2405
02:08:11,230 --> 02:08:13,150
是我随手抓到的
I'd just found it.

2406
02:08:13,900 --> 02:08:16,320
它肯定是掉下来了
It must have fallen off.

2407
02:08:18,230 --> 02:08:20,350
德西推门闯进来时我正抓着它
I was holding it when Desi pushed in.

2408
02:08:20,350 --> 02:08:21,900
所以他是从我那抢的
So, he got it from me.

2409
02:08:21,950 --> 02:08:23,160
关于那个小木屋...
About that woodshed...

2410
02:08:23,200 --> 02:08:24,870
他把我带到他的湖边小屋
He took me to his lake house.

2411
02:08:25,450 --> 02:08:27,160
把我绑到他的床上
Tied me to his bed.

2412
02:08:27,200 --> 02:08:29,740
再说一下那个小木屋  很快  很快
Back to the woodshed real quick. Real quick.

2413
02:08:29,790 --> 02:08:31,630
你去那里放玩偶的时候
When you went to place the puppets there,

2414
02:08:31,660 --> 02:08:33,060
有没有注意到那个棚屋很满
did you notice that it was packed...

2415
02:08:33,080 --> 02:08:34,240
里面好多东西
Lots of stuff.

2416
02:08:34,290 --> 02:08:35,930
都是用你丈夫名下的信用卡
Corresponding to purchases

2417
02:08:35,930 --> 02:08:38,710
买来的东西
made on credit cards in your husband's name.

2418
02:08:38,750 --> 02:08:40,250
尼克和他的信用卡
Nick and credit cards.

2419
02:08:40,300 --> 02:08:42,850
他买东西  我唠叨  我不知道  也许吧
He buys, I nag. I don't know, probably.

2420
02:08:42,880 --> 02:08:44,500
他在马尔家藏了很多东西
He hid a lot of stuff at Go's.

2421
02:08:44,500 --> 02:08:45,670
他们俩很亲近
They're very close.

2422
02:08:46,220 --> 02:08:50,550
我现在可以继续讲我被一个
Now, may I go back to where I was being held prisoner

2423
02:08:50,600 --> 02:08:53,360
有精神病史的人囚禁的事了吗
by a man with a history of mental problems?

2424
02:08:53,390 --> 02:08:54,470
请继续  邓恩女士
Please continue, Ms. Dunne.

2425
02:08:58,770 --> 02:09:00,850
德西当晚侵犯了我
Desi assaulted me that night.

2426
02:09:01,820 --> 02:09:03,660
晚晚如此
Every night.

2427
02:09:04,780 --> 02:09:07,190
他把我像狗一样绑着
He tied me up like a dog.

2428
02:09:08,580 --> 02:09:11,080
然后他就惩罚我
And then, he'd punish me.

2429
02:09:13,000 --> 02:09:15,050
饿着我
Starve me.

2430
02:09:16,330 --> 02:09:18,250
给我除毛
Shave me.

2431
02:09:19,880 --> 02:09:21,840
鸡奸我
Sodomize me.

2432
02:09:22,630 --> 02:09:24,460
他家到处都是摄像头
There were cameras everywhere.

2433
02:09:24,510 --> 02:09:27,470
请找出来  请把录像带找出来
Please find this. Please find the tapes.

2434
02:09:29,140 --> 02:09:32,350
她用开箱刀割了他的喉咙
She slit his throat with a box cutter.

2435
02:09:33,430 --> 02:09:35,640
如果她一直被他绑着
How did she manage to get a hold of a box cutter,

2436
02:09:35,690 --> 02:09:38,280
那她是怎么拿到开箱刀的呢
if he had her tied up the whole time?

2437
02:09:39,230 --> 02:09:41,270
你就不能为你妻子安全回家而开心吗
Can't you just be happy your wife is home and safe?

2438
02:09:42,070 --> 02:09:44,030
艾米  我们找到了你的日记
Amy, we found your diary.

2439
02:09:44,070 --> 02:09:45,690
里面你多次指控
It contains many concerning

2440
02:09:45,690 --> 02:09:48,160
你丈夫对你进行精神和身体上的虐待
allegations of mental and physical abuse.

2441
02:09:48,200 --> 02:09:51,080
这就是丑恶的真相
Well, it's the ugly truth.

2442
02:09:51,910 --> 02:09:53,410
尼克不想要孩子
Nick didn't want a baby.

2443
02:09:55,250 --> 02:09:58,550
他脾气大  我们还有经济问题
He has a temper. We had money problems.

2444
02:09:59,460 --> 02:10:00,580
但我爱他
But I love him.

2445
02:10:00,630 --> 02:10:02,380
那你为什么要买枪呢
Then why did you try to buy a gun?

2446
02:10:04,340 --> 02:10:06,420
对不起  我觉得我要晕了
I'm sorry, I feel myself fading.

2447
02:10:06,470 --> 02:10:08,310
请再让我问清楚一件事
If I could just clarify one thing...

2448
02:10:08,340 --> 02:10:11,550
如果这个案子一直交给你这么无能的人
If this case had been left in your deeply incompetent hands

2449
02:10:11,600 --> 02:10:13,480
我丈夫肯定早就被判了死刑
my husband would be on death row,

2450
02:10:13,770 --> 02:10:17,520
而我肯定还被绑在床上呢
and I'd be tied, still, spread-eagle.

2451
02:10:17,810 --> 02:10:21,480
邓恩女士  您很勇敢  我们问完了
Ms. Dunne, you've been very brave. We're finished.

2452

现在  我得问你
Now, I have to ask you

2453

你觉得和你丈夫回家安全吗
do you feel safe going home with your husband?

2454
02:10:39,830 --> 02:10:42,460
我们向上帝祈祷  上帝回应了我们的祷告

心怀感激

你很完美
You were perfect.

2465
02:12:06,460 --> 02:12:09,000
电视上的尼克正是我当初爱上的那人
The Nick I saw on TV, that's the Nick I fell in love with.

2466
02:12:09,050 --> 02:12:09,970
你知道我只是
You do know I was just

2467
02:12:09,970 --> 02:12:11,760
故意拣你想听的说  对吧
telling you what you wanted to hear, right?

2468

你杀了人  艾米  你是个杀人犯

而我还专攻狗血案

2525
02:16:29,600 --> 02:16:31,430
你和艾米住在同一个屋檐下

2526
02:16:31,480 --> 02:16:33,280

你现在不再身处险境了

我全身都写满了"身处险境"

2540
02:17:03,260 --> 02:17:05,410
有人请你写书  拍电影
You got a book deal, a lifetime movie,

2541
02:17:05,410 --> 02:17:07,390
酒吧也变成了连锁

2542

你也许该感谢她

全国的焦点都在我们身上  但我们搞砸了

九月二十三日 回家七周后

2570
02:18:59,470 --> 02:18:59,660
都是谎言

2571
02:18:59,710 --> 02:19:03,800
她是个工于心计  凶残的变态
She is a calculating, murderous psychopath.

2572
02:19:04,420 --> 02:19:05,960
我一直和她串通一气

亲爱的

我们该拉手
We should hold hands.

2577
02:19:22,060 --> 02:19:25,150
不用一直拉着  但要偶尔拉一下

"尼克  娇妻失而复得感觉如何"

2582
02:19:36,410 --> 02:19:38,120
"棒极了"有点轻浮
"Fantastic" is a little flippant.

2583
02:19:38,540 --> 02:19:39,670
"了不起"
"Amazing"?

2584
02:19:39,710 --> 02:19:42,550
我要你承认你用信用卡买了那些东西

2594
02:20:14,370 --> 02:20:15,620
我是跟着故事走

2595
02:20:15,660 --> 02:20:18,630
你暗示我跟我姐之间存在不伦关系
You implied that I had carnal relations with my sister.

2596
02:20:18,660 --> 02:20:22,200
我可没那么说  只是说你们俩"非常亲近"
I didn't use the "I" word. I said you two were "Extremely close."

2597
02:20:22,250 --> 02:20:26,930
你和一群笨蛋把我分析成反社会者
You and a panel of nitwits diagnosed me as a sociopath.

2598
02:20:28,130 --> 02:20:29,880

2599
02:20:33,590 --> 02:20:35,380

02:21:03,540 --> 02:21:05,200
我根本没碰过你
I didn't touch you.

2607
02:21:05,250 --> 02:21:06,290
你不需要碰我
You didn't need to.

2608
02:21:06,340 --> 02:21:09,550
胡扯  那张废弃通知书
Bullshit. That notice of disposal.

2609
02:21:09,590 --> 02:21:11,100
我有的  被你给扔了

随便你怎么教那些人恨我

我不在乎  我要离开你

2616
02:21:24,730 --> 02:21:27,440
我不用教你的孩子恨你

他自己就会了

2618
02:21:29,900 --> 02:21:31,770
你这个该死的婊子
You fucking cunt!

02:21:33,650 --> 02:21:36,030
那我也是你娶回家的婊子
I'm the cunt you married.

你唯一喜欢自己的时候
The only time you liked yourself,

02:21:37,910 --> 02:21:41,580
就是当你努力成为这个婊子喜欢的人的时候

2622
02:21:41,620 --> 02:21:45,080
我不会放弃的  我就是这种婊子

2623
02:21:48,840 --> 02:21:52,090
我为你杀过人  还有谁能这么说

2624
02:21:53,340 --> 02:21:55,880
你以为你娶个中西部的小姑娘就开心了
You think you would be happy with a nice midwestern girl?

2625
02:21:55,930 --> 02:21:58,770
不可能的  宝贝  你要的人就是我
No way, baby. I'm it.

2626
02:21:58,800 --> 02:22:02,220
你有妄想症  你神经错乱了

02:22:02,270 --> 02:22:03,770
你做这些到底是为什么呀
Why would you even want this?

2628

是  我是爱过你
Yes, I loved you.

2629
02:22:05,270 --> 02:22:07,290
可后来咱俩只剩互相怨恨
And then all we did was resent each other,

2630
02:22:07,290 --> 02:22:08,740
互相试图控制对方
and try to control each other.

2631
02:22:08,770 --> 02:22:09,810
和给对方造成痛苦了
And cause each other pain.

2632
02:22:10,320 --> 02:22:12,110
这就是婚姻
That's marriage.

2633
02:22:14,780 --> 02:22:17,160
我要去准备了
Now, I'm getting ready.

2634

我无法眼睁睁地看着你

我不能一走了之

02:22:48,940 --> 02:22:52,820
不可能的  你也清楚
