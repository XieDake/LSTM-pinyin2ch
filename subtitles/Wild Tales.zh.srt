他们会认为是他是胆固醇太高才死的
They are going to think that it was the cholesterol

152
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:12,000
你给他做薯条煎蛋吧
Can you make him the fries with eggs?

153
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:24,000
我能问问你在某些事情上的意见吗？
Can I ask for your opinion on something?

154

你看着像个细心的女孩，来这儿

你觉得我在这张照片上看着太严肃了吗

谢谢
Thank you

162
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,000
并且监狱也不是太差
Besides jail is not that bad

163
00:14:58,500 --> 00:15:00,000
它只是公众影响不好
It just has bad publicity

164
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,000
他们给你吃的
They give you food

165
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:05,000
你不用付房租
You don't pay rent

166
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:07,000
你无忧无虑地生活
You live with no worries

167
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:09,000
如果找对了狱友圈子，你会玩儿得很开心的
And if you have good group
you'll have a lot of fun

168
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:13,000
一起打桥牌
You play bridge

169
00:15:13,500 --> 00:15:15,000
你在监狱里待过？
You were in jail?

170
00:15:15,700 --> 00:15:17,000
待过一段时间
For some time

171
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:19,000
我保证在里面我更自由
And I can assure I felt more free there

172
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,000
这个餐厅真是个破地方
This is a shithole

173
00:15:22,900 --> 00:15:24,000
你做了什么进了监狱
And wht did you do?

00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:26,000
我不会后悔的事
Nothing that I regret

175

并且他还要竞选市长
Besides he is going to run for mayor

176
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,000
那个混蛋，你能相信吗
That son of a bitch. Can you believe it?

177
00:15:37,300 --> 00:15:40,000
怎么不相信，那些混蛋现在都统治世界了
How am I not going to believe it when those bastards
rule the world

178
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,000
清醒点，姑娘
Wake up, girl!

179
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:46,000
你觉得怎么样
What do you say

180
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,000
我们要为这个社会做点好事吗
Do we make a favor for the community?

181
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,000
太好了
Perfect

182
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,000
你放了老鼠药
You put the rat posion!

183
00:16:24,500 --> 00:16:28,000
别装无辜，你早看见了
Don't play like a naive girl. Tell me you
didn't noticed it

184
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,000
这个国家就是这么做事的
That's how this country runs

185
00:16:33,000 --> 00:16:37,000
每个人都想报复这种混蛋，但是从没人敢动一根指头
Everybody wants give this characters what they deserve
but nobody wants to move a finger

186
00:16:39,000 --> 00:16:40,500
自豪吧，姑娘
Feel proud about it, girl

187
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:46,000
你终于在你悲惨的生活中做了点有意义的事了
For once in your miserable life you are
doing something worthy

188
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:48,000
嘿！我什么也没做
Hey! I'm not doing anything here

189
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:51,000
没做？跟我商量毒死他而不是撤掉他盘子的可是你
No? You keep discussing with me instead of taking away his plate?

190
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,000
放松，你什么事也不用担心
Calm down. You don't have to worry about anything

191
00:16:55,500 --> 00:16:59,000
审问的时候我会说是我今天早上在厨房放了老鼠药
In the investigation I'm going to say that this morning
I was placing poison in the kitchen

192
00:16:59,000 --> 00:17:02,000
因为这儿到处长虫子，这也确实是真的
Because everything was full of bugs, which on the other hand
it is completely true

193
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:06,000
有一小块药恰好掉到盘子里了，警方又能说什么
And that coincidentally a little rock got inside a pan.
What are they going to tell me

194
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,600
这真是疯了
This is madness

195
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:17,000
嘿，这破药没过期，对吧？
Hey, this shit wasn't expired, right?

196
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,000
上面没写保质期
It doesn't say the expiring date

197
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,000
老鼠药要是过期了
How was it?

198
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:29,000
会怎么样
When a poison is expired

199
00:17:29,500 --> 00:17:31,000
毒性更强还是更弱？
Is it more or less deadly

200
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:52,000
-你好吗
-Everything fine?
-当然

-What if I got heat these up a little?
-不用了，不用了，放这儿就行
-No, no, leave it there

205

需要热的话我会叫你
If i need you to heat them up I'll ask you

206

能给他来瓶芬达吗
Could you bring him a Fanta, please?

207
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:25,900
我受够这姑娘了
I'm fed up with this girl

208
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:33,500
我们得做点儿什么，他俩现在都在吃
We have to do something, both are eating now

209
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:35,000
到底放了毒药吗
Do we put more posion?

210
00:18:35,000 --> 00:18:36,000
他是个孩子！
He's a kid!

211
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:38,000
不过他会长大的，变得跟他爹一个德行
But he is going to grow. Like father like son

212
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:40,000
斩草要除根
It's better if we finish with all the weed right now

213
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,000
嘿，我感觉不太舒服
Hey, I don't think I'm feeling right

214
00:18:48,800 --> 00:18:49,900
你怎么了
What is happening to you?

215
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:54,000
你还好吗
Are you ok?

216
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:56,000
-不好意思，这菜肯定都冷了
-Excuse me, this has to be freezing by now
-别动，放在这儿
-No, leave it there!

217
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,000
谁他妈的教你这么工作的，能让人好好吃饭吗
Who the fuck taught you to work like these
Could you let people eat in peace?

218
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:18,000

好的，亲爱的

不，我要去我办公室看有没有语音信息，然后就走
No, I'm going to go to my office to check the voicemail
and then I'll leave

306
00:41:20,000 --> 00:41:21,500
我会带着蛋糕5点去的，别担心
I'm going to be there at 5 with the cake. 
Don't worry

307
00:41:23,500 --> 00:41:25,000
5点，带着蛋糕，别担心，我不会忘了
At 5 I'm there with the cake. Don't worry,
I'll not forget it

308
00:41:45,500 --> 00:41:47,000
我希望你喜欢蛋糕的样子
I hope you like how it looks

309
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:50,000
当然，她会非常喜欢的，谢谢
Yes, she's going to love it. Thank you

00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:06,000
一共360块
It will be 360

311
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:08,000
它是进口的吗
Was it imported?

312
00:42:11,000 --> 00:42:12,900
一，二，能给我张账单吗
One, two... Can you give me a bill?

313
00:42:13,000 --> 00:42:15,000
我们有羊角面包，"治安委员"
Yes, we have croissants, "vigilantes"

314
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,000
票，账单
The ticket. Bill

315
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:20,000
哦，是的，当然，我会带来的
Oh! yes, of course. I'll bring it

316
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:14,000
他们一定是一群蠢蛋
They had to be a bunch of douchebags

317
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:26,000
请微笑，我们在拍你
[SMILE, WE ARE FILMING YOU]

318
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:29,000
下一个
Next!

319
00:43:32,000 --> 00:43:33,000
你好
Hello

320
00:43:34,000 --> 00:43:37,000
是这样的，我把车停在...
Look, I parked my car...

321
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:38,000
请出示驾驶证
Your license, please

322
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:40,600
好的
Yes

323
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:45,000
请好好跟我说话
Talk to me nicely, please

324
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:46,000
我在好好跟你说话啊，先生
I'm talking to you nicely, sir

325
00:43:46,000 --> 00:43:47,000
可能吧
More or less

326
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,000
拖车费用是430比索，我们会把发单寄到你的地址
The towing service will be 430 pesos and you we will
send the fine to your address

327
00:43:54,300 --> 00:43:57,000
好的，但是你没听我的解释
Yes, but you're not listening to what I want to explain

328
00:43:57,000 --> 00:44:00,000
人行道根本就没划线
The sidewalk was completely unpainted

329
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:03,000
我不可能知道这里是禁止停车的
There was no possible way that I could know that the place
was a no-parking area

330
00:44:05,000 --> 00:44:06,000
我明白
I understand

331
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:09,000
我懂了，如果你想从这儿把车开走，你必须付拖车费用，好吗
I see. Now, if you want to retreive the vehicle from here
You will have to pay the towing service. Ok?

332
00:44:10,000 --> 00:44:13,000
然后，你可以在工作日申请退款
Later, if you want you can make a withdrawal from monday to friday,
from eight to fourteen hours

333
00:44:13,000 --> 00:44:19,000
请找一楼211房间的Carlos Pellegrini.
In the address Carlos Pellegrini 211, first floor

334
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:21,000
嗯..不，你知道我们会做什么吗
Hmm. No. Do you know what we are going to do?

335
00:44:23,000 --> 00:44:26,000
我会让你找遍你能找的人
I'm going to ask you to go and talk to whoever you have to

336
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:30,000
我想不花一分钱就取走我的车
I want to take my car without paying a penny

337
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,500
我想让你赔我到这儿的打车钱
I want you to give me what I paid 
for the taxi to get here and

338
00:44:33,500 --> 00:44:35,000
并且给我一个真诚的道歉
And that you give my respective apologies

339
00:44:35,500 --> 00:44:37,000
你笑什么，我是认真的
What are you laughing about, I'm being serious

340
00:44:37,000 --> 00:44:40,000
那种当他们错了会给你道歉的办公室在哪儿
Where is the office where they give you your apologies
when they make a mistake?

341
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:43,000
我们是一条船上的，先生，请快点
We are all in the same boat, sir. Hurry up, please

342
00:44:43,000 --> 00:44:47,000
你看，罚单上说你的车停在了禁停区
Look. The ticket said your car
was in a no-parking zone

343
00:44:47,000 --> 00:44:49,000
我会再重复一遍，我们不需要更多的证据
We don't need more proof than that.
I'll repeat again

344
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:51,000
你想取车就得付钱
If you want to take your car you have to pay

345
00:44:51,000 --> 00:44:54,000
如果不行请你离开，我们还要继续工作
If that's not the case I'll ask you to leave
and let me continue working

346
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,000
我要是没有现金呢
And if I don't have cash?

347
00:44:55,000 --> 00:44:58,000
可以用信用卡，借钱，或者改天再来
You can pay it with credit, debit,
or you can come another day.

348
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:00,000
不管怎样，我们都要收到罚款
However, we will charge you for the car
parked here

349
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:04,000
你知道你是个罪犯吗
Did you know that you're a criminal?

350
00:45:04,500 --> 00:45:07,000
-我只是在做我的工作
-I'm doing my jobe here
-不是
-No

351
00:45:07,000 --> 00:45:10,000
协助犯罪的人也是罪犯
The ones who work for criminals are
other criminals

352
00:45:10,500 --> 00:45:12,400
当然，这也是一种看待问题的方法
Well, it's a way of looking at it

353
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:15,000
悲惨的公务员
Miserable public worker

354
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,000
腐败的公共服务系统
Of this corrupt system

355
00:45:22,000 --> 00:45:24,000
谢谢，日安
Thank you, have a nice day

356
00:45:36,300 --> 00:45:38,000
你出生的时候我们和你在一起
We were with you when you were born

357
00:45:39,000 --> 00:45:41,000
当你收到第一个玩具
When you received your first toys

358
00:45:43,000 --> 00:45:45,000
我快到了
[I'M ARRIVING]

359
00:45:57,000 --> 00:46:00,000
别来了，人都快走完了
[DON'T COME, ALMOST EVERYBODY LEFT]

360
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:35,000
祝你生日快乐，祝你生日快乐
Happy Birthday to you. Happy Birthday to you

361
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:43,000
祝亲爱的Camila生日快乐
Happy Birthday dear Camila.
Happy Birthday to you

362
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:47,000
生日快乐，亲爱的
Happy Birthday, honey

363
00:46:49,000 --> 00:46:50,000
让他们再唱一遍
Tell them to sing again

364
00:46:51,000 --> 00:46:52,500
别跟我说话，Simon
Don't even talk to me, Simón

365
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:57,000
你好，亲爱的，生日快乐
Hello, darling. Happy Birthday

366
00:47:02,000 --> 00:47:02,600
你好孩子们
Hello kids

367
00:47:03,000 --> 00:47:03,900
你好吗，Antonio
How are you, Antonio

368
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,000
你好，亲爱的，一切都很好
Hello, dear! Everything's good

369
00:47:07,000 --> 00:47:09,000
-嗨，你好吗
-Hello. How are you
-我们要走了
-We were leaving

370
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:14,000
等等，我和你一块儿走
Wait, I'll come with you

371
00:47:23,000 --> 00:47:25,000
你就不能先打车过来，完事之后再去取车
Couldn't you take a taxi and take the car later?

372
00:47:25,000 --> 00:47:28,000
-不能！
-No! No!
-你错过了你女儿的生日聚会
-You missed your daughter's brithday, Simón

373
00:47:29,500 --> 00:47:33,000
你觉得什么事都简单，我已经厌倦了人们从我身上拿钱
Everything is so easy for you.
I'm just tired of people taking my money

374
00:47:33,000 --> 00:47:35,000
人行道绝对没划线！
The sidewalk was absolutely unpainted!

375
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:40,000
你知道这让我多生气吗
Do you have any idea of the anger this produces on me?

376
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:44,000
你事事责怪别人让我很生气你知道吗
Do you have any idea of the anger this produces on me
that you always blame everything?

377
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,000
你事事都抱怨社会
That you have to blame society for everything

378
00:47:47,000 --> 00:47:50,000
今天是车，昨天是交通，明天没准是抗议集会
Today it was the car. Yesterday it was the traffic.
Tomorrow will be the protest

379
00:47:51,000 --> 00:47:53,000
事实是你本来可以早点到这儿
The truth is that you were perfectly capable
of leaving earlier

380
00:47:53,000 --> 00:47:56,000
你还能帮我组织聚会
You could've helped me organize the party

381
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,000
你也能来迎接你女儿的客人
And you would be ready to receive your daughter's guests

382
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:01,000
但是事情不是这样的，你觉得什么事都比家庭优先
But no. Everything is a priority except
your family

383
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:05,000
-不
-No
-而我像个傻子似的站在这儿，想着你能改变
-And I am standing here like an idiot
Thinking that you'll change

384
00:48:06,000 --> 00:48:07,000
你知道吗？
And you know what?

385
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:08,000
社会是不会变的
Society will not change

386
00:48:09,500 --> 00:48:10,500
你也不会变
You will not change

387
00:48:11,000 --> 00:48:12,500
我已经受够了
And I am tired of it

388
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:19,000
这是什么意思
What does that mean?

389
00:48:20,000 --> 00:48:23,000
你是工程师，你来算算
The engineer here is you. 
Make the math

390
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:29,000
政府让私企白赚钱
The goverment lets a private company
make money for nothing

391
00:48:29,300 --> 00:48:32,000
很明显是为了让我们去花政府让我们花的钱
Obviously in exchange for a payment that
we all have to choose

392
00:48:34,000 --> 00:48:36,000
真不公平，不过事实就是这样的
It's indignant, but it'ss like that

393
00:48:37,000 --> 00:48:38,000
你有两种选择
And you have two choices

394
00:48:38,000 --> 00:48:40,000
要不然交了钱再工作赚回来
You either pay and work a little

395
00:48:40,000 --> 00:48:42,000
要不然当街暴毙而亡
Or your heart explodes due to stress

396
00:48:44,000 --> 00:48:45,000
你明白的
And you know what, man

397
00:48:46,000 --> 00:48:48,000
我活着有很多原因
I have a lot of reasons to live

398
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:51,000
我想航海，和我的孙辈旅行
I want to sail.
Travel the world with my grandchildren

399
00:48:52,000 --> 00:48:53,000
别生气
Don't get angry

400
00:49:01,000 --> 00:49:03,000
-你好，早上好
-Hello. Good morning
-早上好
-Good morning

401
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:09,000
他们归档没问题，我也已经付了拖车费，不过这儿有误会
They filed this fine, and I already payed
the towing service. But there's an error

402
00:49:09,000 --> 00:49:11,500
-因为人行道没划线
-Because the sidewalk was unpainted...
-能让我看看吗
-Would you let me see?

403
00:49:11,500 --> 00:49:12,000
当然
Yes

404
00:49:16,000 --> 00:49:17,000
一共560比索
It is 560 pesos

405
00:49:20,000 --> 00:49:26,000
听着，我有点紧张，所以请听我说
Look. I'm a little nervous here
So I'll ask you to listen to me

406
00:49:28,000 --> 00:49:34,000
人行道没划线，我认为你应该让人标明他们在哪儿拖走了我的车
The sidewalk was unpainted. I think you should
send someone to the address where they took my car

407
00:49:34,500 --> 00:49:36,000
来证明我是对的
In order to verify that I'm right

408
00:49:38,000 --> 00:49:42,000
然后，让市政府向我道歉，因为我是对的
Then, ask the city's government to
forgive me, because I'm right

409
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:46,000
还了我的钱，并且为我损失的时间赔偿
Give me back the money I paid.
AND pay me for all the time I've been wasting

410
00:49:48,000 --> 00:49:50,000
罚单上写了车停在了禁停区
The ticket says that the car was
in a no-parking zone

411
00:49:51,000 --> 00:49:53,000
这就是足够的证据
And that is considered enough proof

412
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:56,000
你必须付罚款560比索
The fine is 560 pesos that you HAVE to pay

413
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:59,000
如果不付我们会开始收利息
If you don't pay we will start charging interests

414
00:50:00,000 --> 00:50:01,000
你在听吗
Are you listening to me?

415
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,000
足够的证据？去你妈的
Enough proof? Fuck off.

416
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:08,000
我是说路边没有画黄线
I'm telling you
the curb was not painted yellow

417
00:50:08,000 --> 00:50:10,000
首先，请你不要侮辱我
First, I'm going to ask you
to stop insulting me

418
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:12,000
因为我在工作
Because I'm working here

419
00:50:12,000 --> 00:50:15,000
其次，你需要好好了解法律的作用
Second, you should inform yourself
of how the law works

420
00:50:15,500 --> 00:50:20,000
法律上没有不知者无罪这一说
The fact that you don't know the laws
does not excempt you from braking them

421
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:25,500
有天你杀了人还说：“我不知道不可以那么做。”你早进监狱了
Tomorrow you kill somebody and say
"I didn't know you couldn't do that"
You'll go to jail

422
00:50:25,500 --> 00:50:27,000
没关系，没人告诉过你
That's fine, maybe nobody explained it to you 

423
00:50:27,000 --> 00:50:29,000
但是你还说会进监狱，你懂吗？
But you still go to jail.
Is it understandable?

424
00:50:29,700 --> 00:50:33,000
你的例子不够贴切
This example that you just gave wasn't
very accurate

425
00:50:33,000 --> 00:50:38,000
照这么说我得记住哪些街道能停车哪些不能
With that criteria I should know by heart
the streets where I can park and the ones where I can't

426
00:50:38,000 --> 00:50:41,000
根本不用考虑划没划线
Without taking in account whether they are painted or not

427
00:50:41,000 --> 00:50:44,000
对，这些信息在车管所的网站上都有
Exactly. The information is available in the website
of the Department of Mobile Vehicles

428
00:50:45,000 --> 00:50:48,000
好吧，我想和你们经理谈谈
Ok. I need to talk with your manager, please

429
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,000
不能，这儿没有你可以谈的经理
No, there's no manager to call

430
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:50,500
没有？
No?

431
00:50:50,500 --> 00:50:53,000
你以为你是谁？国家总统吗？
Who do you think you are?
The president of the country, moron?

432
00:50:54,000 --> 00:50:56,000
先生，还有好多人等着呢
Sir, there's a lot of people

433
00:50:56,300 --> 00:50:58,000
你要是不交罚款请让我继续工作
If you don't want to pay I'll ask you to let me work

434
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:02,000
当一个罪犯是什么感觉？来，告诉我
What does it feel like to be a criminal?
Come on, tell me

435
00:51:03,000 --> 00:51:04,000
保安
Security in station seven

436
00:51:04,000 --> 00:51:06,000
你要叫保安？太好了
Are you calling for security? Great!

437
00:51:07,000 --> 00:51:10,000
我要声明，我维护我作为公民的权利，所以我是个罪犯
I am making a claim. I am defending as a citizen
and I'm a criminal

438
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:11,300
你要躲在后面叫保安
You have to be behind there
and call for security

439
00:51:11,300 --> 00:51:12,400
你想叫保安吗
Do you want to call security?

440
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:16,000
叫保安啊，叫啊
Call security! Call it!

441
00:51:19,600 --> 00:51:20,600
快叫保安
Now call for security!

他们没强奸你吧？
They didn't rape you, right?

446
00:51:59,000 --> 00:52:03,000
真是不敢相信，太不敢相信了
It's unbelievable. 
Really unbelievable

447
00:52:04,000 --> 00:52:05,000
真是疯了

00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:09,000
Seijas已经叫了公司的律师并且让他全权负责
Seijas sent a lawyer from the company
and told him to be in charge of everything

他们说你在公司工作
They mention that you work for the firm

454
00:52:22,000 --> 00:56:25,000
（我大工行？）

455
00:52:24,300 --> 00:52:27,000
Seijas的父母可不喜欢你闯的祸
Seija's partners didn't like the shit you pulled

456
00:52:28,000 --> 00:52:31,000
市政府是我们的主顾之一
The city's government is one of our main clients!

457
00:52:34,000 --> 00:52:36,000
他们要把你裁掉，Simon

已经决定了
It has been decided

459
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:46,000
我明白你现在没有工作，Fischer先生
I understand that at this moment you don't have a job, Mr. Fischer

460
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,000
是的，问这个干吗
Yes. Why you ask?

461
00:52:48,000 --> 00:52:49,000
这是一种犯罪吗
Is it a crime?

462
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:51,000
我没说这是犯罪，对吧？
I didn't say it was a crime, right?

463
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:56,000
对，但是我觉得我听出了谴责的语气
Right. But I think I perceived certain condemning tone

464
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:01,000
这不是犯罪，不过现在付你妻子的生活费会成问题
It is not a crime, but it's a problem at the time
to be pay the living of your wife

465
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:08,000
律师在谈Camila的生活费的事，包括衣服，学费...
The lawyer is talking about the living expenses of Camila
that includes clothes, school...

466
00:53:08,000 --> 00:53:09,000
不好意思
Excuse me

467
00:53:11,000 --> 00:53:15,000
从我认识我妻子开始我就已经每年都给她生活费了
I've been in charge of the yearly expenses of my wife
since I know her

468
00:53:16,000 --> 00:53:19,000
我女儿也什么都不缺
And my daughter will not be missing anything

469
00:53:19,000 --> 00:53:21,000
如果我有问题，别担心，我会处理好的
If I have a problem, don't worry because I'll fix it

470
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:25,000
幸运的是Malamut女士还真有份工作
Luckily Ms. Malamut DOES have a job at the moment

471
00:53:25,000 --> 00:53:29,000
所以我们认为Fischer先生没有必要共享这份生活费
So we don't see the necesitty of granting Mr. Fischer
the shared expenses

472
00:53:30,000 --> 00:53:31,000
对不起，不好意思
I'm sorry. Excuse me

473
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:36,000
我已经负担各种各样的费用很多年了
I've been in charge of everything for years

474
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:39,000
就这一个月她有工作我没有
And for a month where she has a job and I don't

475
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:43,000
我都没有权利分享我自己女儿的生活费
I don't have the right to share the expenses of my daughter?

476
00:53:43,000 --> 00:53:47,000
我希望法官能考虑考虑这多不公平
I hope the judge will take into account
how unfair this situation is

477
00:53:47,000 --> 00:53:51,800
法官不会考虑的是你对妻子使用的暴力
What the judge won't take into account is the violence
that you are using with your wife

478
00:53:51,800 --> 00:53:54,000
什么暴力？
WHAT violence?!

479
00:53:54,000 --> 00:53:58,000
我只是在描述一种情况，你在哪儿看见了暴力
I'm describing a situation.
Where do you see the violence?

480
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:02,000
我看暴力了，在很多地方
I see violence, Mr. Fischer.
In a lot of places

481
00:54:02,000 --> 00:54:06,000
我看见街上有暴力，我看见电视上也有暴力
I see violence in the street.
I see violence when the TV is on

482
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:10,000
就说近处，我在报纸上就看见了
Without going very far. I can see it
in an article of this newspaper

483
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:17,000
我觉得这种情节小孩子还是少见为好
And I'm convinced that the less contact a small kid
can have with this type of episodes

484
00:54:17,000 --> 00:54:19,000
为了他们的精神健康

你想把我女儿带走吗
Do you want to take away my daughter?

487
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:24,000
不，不是那样的
No, it's not that

488
00:54:25,000 --> 00:54:27,000
那是什么样的？你傻了吗？
Then what is it?! Are you going nuts?

489
00:54:27,000 --> 00:54:31,000
好吧，我和我的客户要终止这次调解
All right. My client and I will end the mediation

490
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:34,000
我们法院上再见吧
And we will mantain silence until we see each other in Tribunales

491
00:54:35,000 --> 00:54:38,000
你就不说点什么吗？谁雇的你？她？
You're not planning to say anything?
Who hired you. Her?

492
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:41,000
Fischer先生，请冷静一下
Mr. Fischer, calm down. Please

493
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,000
-你好

我更希望自己交给她

497
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:17,000
如果Ederer先生在这儿，我想跟他聊聊
and if Mr. Ederer's here,
I'd like to have a word with him

498
00:55:17,000 --> 00:55:19,000
我在马丁内斯联营公司
I worked for over ten years...

499

工作了十多年
at Seijas Raffo Martinez and Associates

00:55:21,000 --> 00:55:23,000
我不是新手

工程师现在不在这儿
The engineer is on a construction site

我又不掌控她的行程

505
00:55:34,000 --> 00:55:38,000
你猜怎样？我他妈的不会给你留下任何东西
You know what?
I won't leave you a damn thing

506
00:55:38,000 --> 00:55:42,000
你，Ederer和他的秘书，都去你妈的
You can all go fuck yourselves:

507

尤其是他的秘书，所有人都去你妈的

Everybody can go fuck themselves!

508

下午4点吃午餐？他们还真当我是傻子了
Lunch at 4 pm?
They must think I'm an idiot!

509

你的车是蓝色的雪佛兰吗
The blue Chevrolet?

510
00:59:17,000 --> 00:59:21,000
你太没礼貌了，纯属是个法西斯主义者
You are being rude, and this is completely fascist

511
00:59:21,000 --> 00:59:24,000
-我得先付钱再讨论？

Friends, or any girls?

559
01:04:52,000 --> 01:04:56,000
我不知道，不记得了
I don't know, I can't remember

died on their way to the hospital

562

给您这种建议真是太难为情了
I'm really embarassed
to propose this to you,

565
01:06:09,000 --> 01:06:13,000
但是我们认识这么多年了
But we've known you for years

566
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:18,000
大家都像一家人了
And I feel we have this
kind of a bond

567
01:06:19,000 --> 01:06:24,000
并且你是个父亲，你希望你的家庭能得到最好的
Besides you are a father,
and you want the best for your family

568
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:31,000
所以我觉得这样比较合适
So I think that an arrangement
like this one will help you

569
01:06:33,500 --> 01:06:42,000
如果你说你昨晚趁家里人睡觉的时候开走了车
If you say that you took the car last night
while we were sleeping

570
01:06:42,000 --> 01:06:47,000
事故发生的时候也是你在开车
And that you drove during the accident

571
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:55,000
我会找最好的律师让你尽快出监狱

get you out of jail as quickly as possible

态度良好的话不到一年半就能出来了
With good conduct you're out in less than
year and a half

573
01:06:58,000 --> 01:07:01,000
-真这样吗
-Does it work that way?
-是的
-It does

574
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:08,000
帮我们这么大忙，我要给你五十万美元
And for that incredible favor
I'll offer you 500,000 dollars

575
01:07:10,000 --> 01:07:14,000
你从来都没赚过那么多钱
You will never win that amount
of money with your job

576
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:18,000
下半辈子你就能让家里人接受良好的教育了
You will be able to provide good education
and well-being to your family for the rest of your life

577
01:07:19,000 --> 01:07:21,000
你了解Santiago
You know Santiago.

578
01:07:23,000 --> 01:07:28,000
他在监狱里过不下去的
He would not survive in a jail

01:07:47,000 --> 01:07:50,000

01:07:55,000 --> 01:07:57,000
尽可能多摸几下
Touch it as much as you can

582
01:08:01,000 --> 01:08:02,000
很好
Good

583
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:06,000
你喝了一杯威士忌，你的老板睡着了
You drank a glass of whisky and your boss
was sleeping

584
01:08:06,000 --> 01:08:09,000
当你像每个晚上那样停车的时候
When you came to park the car like every night

585
01:08:09,000 --> 01:08:10,000
你想把车开出去试试
You felt the need to go drive outside

586
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:12,000
他们要是问起来，你就要说
If they were going to ask you about it,
what are you going to say

587
01:08:12,000 --> 01:08:15,000
你去开车看看车胎性能怎么样
That you just went to check the tires

588
01:08:16,000 --> 01:08:18,000
突然什么东西经过马路
Suddenly something crossed your path

589
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:22,000
你觉得颠了一下，不知道发生了什么
You felt a bump and from then on
you don't remember anything

590
01:08:25,000 --> 01:08:25,700
是的
Yes

591
01:08:29,000 --> 01:08:32,000
Jose,我不知道该怎么表达谢意
José, I can't explain how
grateful I am with you

592
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,000
别，别碰他
No, don't touch each other. Please.

593
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:36,000
没关系，女士
It's fine, Mrs.

594
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:44,000
对不起
Excuse me

595
01:08:46,000 --> 01:08:49,000
我想...我不知道
I'm thinking that... I don't know

596
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:52,000
我想跟我妻子谈谈
I would like to talk it out with my wife

597
01:08:52,000 --> 01:08:56,000
不要，她不能知道，至少现在不行
No. She can't know this, José.
At least for now

598
01:08:56,000 --> 01:08:58,000
万一她说出真相怎么办，我们不能冒这种险
We can't run the risk if she talks

599
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:03,000
如果她说出真相，我们不会帮你，你还是会因为撒谎
And if she talks, the arrangement we did
finishes and you still go to jail

600
01:09:03,000 --> 01:09:04,000
而进监狱
For lying

601
01:09:06,000 --> 01:09:07,000
我亲爱的
My darling

602
01:09:13,000 --> 01:09:16,000
你们两个开着我的SUV去农场
You two take my SUV and go to the ranch

603
01:09:16,000 --> 01:09:20,000
经过收费站的时候别太显眼，也别在任何加油站停下
When you pass the tollbooth look down,
and don't stop at any gas station

604
01:09:20,000 --> 01:09:24,000
想买什么只能付现金
And if you want to buy something
pay only in cash

605
01:09:26,000 --> 01:09:28,000
Santiago，我们走
Santiago, let's go

606
01:09:29,000 --> 01:09:30,000
我们走
Let's go

607
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:40,000
Jose，再坐到车里
José, sit again in the car

608
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:42,000
他坐在后排
He sits in the back

609
01:09:44,000 --> 01:09:46,000
把座移到前面
Move the sit forward

610
01:09:52,000 --> 01:09:56,000
你们两个快回房间睡觉
You two go to your room and go to bed

611
01:09:56,000 --> 01:09:58,000
没人知道这件事 
Nobody knows anything about this

612
01:10:02,000 --> 01:10:04,000
冷静下来，保持沉默
Calm down and be quiet

613
01:10:05,000 --> 01:10:06,000
我会处理好的
I'm in charge of this

614
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:25,500
Mauricio Pereyra Hamilton?

615
01:10:25,500 --> 01:10:26,000
我是他的律师
I'm his lawyer

616
01:10:26,000 --> 01:10:29,000
我正要叫警察，请进
I was about to call the police.
Please, come in

617
01:10:29,500 --> 01:10:31,000
真是太惨了
What a horrible tragedy

618
01:10:31,000 --> 01:10:35,000
大约一小时之前我的客户听见一楼有响动
About an hour ago my client heard something
in the first floor

619
01:10:35,000 --> 01:10:36,000
他以为是小偷进来了
He thought that burglars were trying to get in

620
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:40,000
他下楼时看见了管家
When he goes down to see what happened
He finds the housekeeper

621
01:10:42,000 --> 01:10:45,000
坐在我的客户的车里，喝醉了还受了惊吓
Sitting in his car, drunk and in shock

622
01:10:45,300 --> 01:10:48,000
之后他看了新闻，推断出发生了什么，就马上给我打电话
Then he heard what happened in the news,
he connected everything and then he called me

623
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:54,000
Mauricio Pereyra.这是负责这起事件的律师
Mauricio Pereyra. This is the attorney
in charge of the case

624
01:10:55,000 --> 01:10:56,000

625
01:10:56,000 --> 01:10:58,000
这就是Jose先生
And the gentlman here is José

626
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,000
-你好
-Hello
-他已经为这个家工作了...
-He has worked for the family for...

627
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:03,000
-15年吗
-...15 years?
-是的
-Yes

628
01:11:05,000 --> 01:11:11,000
受害者的丈夫。先生，你对这件事怎么看
...The husband of the victim.
Sir, what's your reaction about this?

629
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:15,000
怎么看？我应该怎么看
What's my reaction about this?
How am I supposed to react

630
01:11:15,000 --> 01:11:16,000
关掉电视，这没必要
Turn it off, it's unnecesary

631
01:11:19,000 --> 01:11:20,500
我只想说一件事
...I'm only going to say one thing

632
01:11:20,500 --> 01:11:22,000
不管是谁都要付出代价的
Whoever was it is going to pay for this

633
01:11:23,000 --> 01:11:27,000
听见了吗？不管你藏在哪儿
Can you hear me? It doesn't matter
where you hide

634
01:11:27,000 --> 01:11:28,000
我都会找...
I'm going to fi...

635
01:11:29,000 --> 01:11:30,000
怎么了Jose
What happened, José?

636
01:11:31,000 --> 01:11:35,000
不好意思，Jose，我想提醒你，你可以保持沉默
Excuse me. José. I want to remind you
that you can stay in silence

637
01:11:35,000 --> 01:11:38,000
在我客户的要求下我要代表Torres先生
I'm going to represent Mr. Torres
by request of my client

638
01:11:38,000 --> 01:11:42,000
没有问题，他还是两个儿子的父亲
There has never been a problem
and he is the father of two sons

639
01:11:44,000 --> 01:11:46,000
你能告诉我这起事故的过程吗
Could you tell me the story of the accident?

640
01:11:47,000 --> 01:11:49,000
可以，这个...
Yes, well...

641
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:52,000
我经常给Mauricio先生停车
I always park the car of Mr. Mauricio

642
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:56,000
我想开他的车兜风已经很久了
And for a while I always wanted
to take the new car for a ride

643
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,000
像宝马这种好车，开出去转转，你懂的
Run it a little, you know? The BMW

644
01:12:00,000 --> 01:12:02,000
昨天晚上
And last night

645
01:12:02,000 --> 01:12:04,000
说实话，我喝了点酒
I drank a little, to be honest

646
01:12:05,300 --> 01:12:07,000
我感觉很兴奋就把车开出去了
And...well. I felt excited so I went out

647
01:12:07,000 --> 01:12:09,000
我从来都没想过会发生什么不好的事
I never imagined that something wrong could happen

648
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:14,000
车开到解放者大街上，然后...
And I was going down Libertador Avenue, and..

649
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:18,000
我开得有点快了，说实话，非常快
And I was going a little fast, to be honest...
...Very fast

650
01:12:19,000 --> 01:12:22,000
突然什么东西经过马路，我没看见
And suddenly something crossed my path.
I couldn't see what was it

651
01:12:22,000 --> 01:12:24,000
我觉得那是条狗
I though it was a dog

652
01:12:24,000 --> 01:12:26,000
我感觉车很重地颠了一下
I felt a very hard bump

653
01:12:27,000 --> 01:12:31,000
我觉得我弄坏了Mauricio先生的车，我很怕
And I got scared because I thought
I ruined Mr. Mauricio's car

654
01:12:32,000 --> 01:12:36,000
所以我想快点回去，在Mauricio先生醒来之前修好车
And I wanted to come back fast
so I could fix it before Mr. Mauricio woke up

655
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:05,000
不好意思
Excuse me

656
01:13:37,000 --> 01:13:41,000
Jose,你能坐到前座上吗
José, would you be kind enough to sit
in the front seat?

657
01:13:49,000 --> 01:13:51,000
-用握方向盘吗
-Do I touch it?
-是的，抓住方向盘
-Yes, grab the steering wheel

658
01:13:55,000 --> 01:13:56,000
请靠在靠背上
Sit back, please

659
01:14:03,000 --> 01:14:05,000
-能关下车门吗
-Could yo close the door?
-当然
-Sure

660
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:21,000
Jose,你用过后视镜吗
José. Do you ever use the rearview mirrors?

661
01:14:21,000 --> 01:14:23,000
后视镜？当然啦，怎么可能不用
Rearview mirrors? Of course!
How am I not going to?

662
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:26,000
因为你在车里位置你只能看到车顶
Because in that position you can
only look at the ceiling

663
01:14:26,000 --> 01:14:28,000
你只压到一个人真是个奇迹
It's a miracle that you only ran over
one person

664
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:31,000
可能他们跟着颠的那一下一起动了
May be they moved with the bump

665
01:14:32,000 --> 01:14:34,000
他们都一起？
All of them at once?

666
01:14:35,000 --> 01:14:36,000
好吧，你可能是对的
Yeah, you may be right

667
01:14:38,000 --> 01:14:42,000
我觉得是一个比你高的人开的车
I would say that his car was drived
by someone taller than you

668
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:45,000
谁还住在这儿
Who else lives in this house?

669
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:49,000
我妻子和儿子，还有一条狗
Yes. My wife and son... The dog

670
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:52,000
让狗接着睡吧
Let the dog sleep

671
01:14:52,000 --> 01:14:54,000
我想见见你的妻子和儿子
I'd like to meet your wife and son

672
01:14:55,000 --> 01:14:58,000
当然可以，我会告诉他们你想见他们
Of course! I'll let them know that you
want to see them

673
01:15:00,000 --> 01:15:03,000
我可以跟你商量一下吗
Do you give me permission
to make a negotiation?

674
01:16:19,000 --> 01:16:21,000
怎么样了
How did it go?

675
01:16:21,000 --> 01:16:22,000
很好
Everything's fine

676
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:26,000
他说事情有回旋的余地，但是...
He is willing to negotiate but...

677
01:16:26,000 --> 01:16:27,000
代价可不便宜
it won't be cheap

678
01:16:28,000 --> 01:16:29,000
多少钱
How much

679
01:16:29,300 --> 01:16:31,000
-一百万
-One million
-美元？
-Dollars?!

680
01:16:31,000 --> 01:16:33,000
他看你吃的住的知道你是个有钱人
He saw how you lived and
the house you've got...

681
01:16:33,000 --> 01:16:34,000
他不会少要的
He won't ask for less

682
01:16:35,000 --> 01:16:37,000
好事是他会打点一切
The good thing is that he will
be in charge of everything

683
01:16:37,000 --> 01:16:40,000
他认识警长和大多数陪审团
He knows the chief of police,
most of the jury

684
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:42,000
他也帮我们圆这个谎
And he would help us reinforce
our story

685
01:16:42,000 --> 01:16:45,000
那管家呢，他能被撇到这件事之外吗
The one of the housekeeper?
We cannot take him out of the deal?

686
01:16:45,000 --> 01:16:47,000
不能，必须得有个肇事者为这件事负责
No, there has to be a responsible for this

687
01:16:47,000 --> 01:16:49,000
这可是一尸两命，每个新闻台都在报道这件事
There were two deaths involved and it's
in every news channel

688
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:52,000
好吧，但是我没有那么多现金给他
That's fine, but I don't know if
I have that amount of money in cash

689
01:16:52,000 --> 01:16:53,000
那可是一百万美元
It's 1.5 million dollars!

690
01:16:53,000 --> 01:16:55,000
我知道，我那部分也在里面
I know, and my part is also in that

691
01:16:55,400 --> 01:16:56,400
你那部分？
Your part?

692
01:16:56,500 --> 01:16:59,000
我可是给你打点好所有事情的人
My part because I'm the person who is fixing
everything for you

693
01:16:59,000 --> 01:17:01,000
我每年给你的公司那么多钱
I pay a lot of money to your firm every year

694
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:05,000
但这是另一回事,Mauricio
But that is for other things, Mauricio

695
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:07,000
这不是日常费用
This is not an every-day fee

696
01:17:08,000 --> 01:17:10,000
我是冒着名声受损的危险
I'm risking my repuation here

697
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:15,000
我可是打算把我的车给你帮你家人逃跑的
I was about to give my SUV to your family
so they could escape

698
01:17:15,000 --> 01:17:16,000
我觉得你可是不讲理了
I think your being inconsiderate

699
01:17:16,000 --> 01:17:18,000
多少钱？
How much are talking

700
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:20,000
我不知道
I don't know...

701
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,000
再加五十万美元？
Another 500,000 dollars?

702
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:26,000
如果你想找别的律师，那也没关系
If you want to call another lawyer
it's fine,

703
01:17:26,000 --> 01:17:27,000
我的工作已经做完了
My work would be done here

704
01:17:30,000 --> 01:17:32,000
收拾好这摊子事
Go finish this

705
01:17:53,000 --> 01:17:55,000
一切还好吗,Jose
Is everything fine, José?

706
01:17:55,000 --> 01:17:56,500
其实不好
Actually, no.

707
01:17:57,000 --> 01:17:57,600
为什么
Why?

708
01:17:58,000 --> 01:18:01,000
坐两年牢，结果我和律师拿了一样多的钱？
For two years in jail I'm going
to get the same as that lawyer?

709
01:18:02,000 --> 01:18:04,000
我知道我穷，但是...
I know I'm poor, but...

710
01:18:04,200 --> 01:18:06,000
你知道你这样做很不好吗
Did you know it's very bad what you
ar doing now?

711
01:18:06,000 --> 01:18:07,000
不好？
Bad?

712
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,000
这样的话你进监狱好了
In that cas you go to jail

713
01:18:09,500 --> 01:18:11,000
昨晚我看了一部西部电影
Last night I watched a cowboy's movie

714
01:18:11,000 --> 01:18:14,500
喝了点酒，像往常一样11点就睡了
I drank some liquor, and I was in bed by 11
like every night

715
01:18:15,500 --> 01:18:17,000
你还想要什么快说
What else do you want?

716
01:18:17,000 --> 01:18:19,000
要明白现在可没时间了
And be clear because there's no time

717
01:18:19,200 --> 01:18:21,000
之前商量好的钱和...
The money we agreed and...

718
01:18:22,000 --> 01:18:23,000
沙滩上的公寓
An appartment in the beach

719
01:18:25,000 --> 01:18:26,000
Mauricio. José

720
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:29,000
我们能一起谈谈吗
Can we all have a talk?

721
01:18:31,000 --> 01:18:32,000
Mauricio

722
01:18:33,000 --> 01:18:36,000
正义，正义，正义
Justice! Justice! Justice!

723
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:40,000
咱们简短地谈一下，先生们
Let's talk fast, gentlemen.

724
01:18:40,000 --> 01:10:43,200
因为我们没时间也不想有任何误会
Because we don't have a lot of time
And we don't want any misunderstandings

725
01:18:43,400 --> 01:18:46,000
你之前编的那个故事不用改了
The story that you made up will not be changed

726
01:18:46,000 --> 01:18:49,500
我会让你们一家人一会儿作证
I will ask you and your family to testify
in a few moments...

727
01:18:49,500 --> 01:18:51,000
谁也不许走
So nobody goes anywhere

728
01:18:51,000 --> 01:18:55,000
你会被拷起来蒙着头带走
You'll leave here handcuffed
and with your head covered

729
01:18:55,000 --> 01:18:58,000
外面会有一大群记者和抗议民众
Outside we will find the news, a mob

730
01:18:58,000 --> 01:18:59,500
他们会采访你，侮辱你
They're going to ask you things.
They're going to insult you

731
01:18:59,500 --> 01:19:01,000
-但是你什么都不能说
-But you will not answer back
-好的
-Sure

732
01:19:01,000 --> 01:19:04,000
我们得止住流言让事情顺利进行
We have to stop the rumors and let
the case go with no friction

733
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,000
让陪审团来判决，大家都会满意
Let the jury make the sentence and
everyone's happy

734
01:19:07,000 --> 01:19:08,000
妈妈，停下
Mom, stop!

735
01:19:10,000 --> 01:19:12,500
他说他想走出去认罪
He says he wants to confess
and go out in the street

736
01:19:12,500 --> 01:19:14,000
这才是正确的
It's the right thing to do!

737
01:19:14,000 --> 01:19:16,000
拜托，给他解释解释，他不懂
Please, explain him he doesn't understand

738
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:18,000
冷静，Santiago
Calm down, Santiago

739
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:20,000
你妈妈是对的
Your mom is right

740
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:21,000
一切都会好起来的
Everything will be fine

741
01:19:21,000 --> 01:19:24,000
拜托你关上门，看好Santiago
Could you, please, close the door
and take care of Santiago?

742
01:19:24,000 --> 01:19:28,000
-好的，我们走吧
-Yes. Let's go.
-别担心，Santi
-Don't worry, Santi.

743
01:19:31,000 --> 01:19:32,000
我们能继续吗
May we continue?

744
01:19:34,000 --> 01:19:36,500
你就是我们之间的联系了
From now on you'll be the connection
between all of us

745
01:19:36,500 --> 01:19:40,000
我不会再见Pereyra先生，除非他出来作证
Me and Mr. Pereyra are not going to talk again
except when he declares the facts

746
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,500
你，Jose,除了你的律师以外不要和任何人说话
And you, José, stay away from all sort 
of communication with anyone who isn't your lawyer

747
01:19:42,500 --> 01:19:43,000
很好
Perfect

748
01:19:43,000 --> 01:19:47,000
我需要一些钱来打通关系
I'm going to need some cash for
any expenses I have to pay

749
01:19:47,000 --> 01:19:49,000
大概三万美元
Around 30,000 dollars

750
01:19:49,000 --> 01:19:51,000
周一一大早就给我
That you'll send me on monday at 
first hour of the morning

751
01:19:51,000 --> 01:19:53,000
不好意思问一下...
I'm sorry I ask...

752
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:56,000
要打通什么关系
What would those expenses be?

753
01:19:57,000 --> 01:20:00,000
外面都是警察
Outside there's the whole police

754
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:03,000
知道一些风声的人我们都要拉拢进来
If somebody saw or heard anything
we will have to put them in the story

755
01:20:03,000 --> 01:20:06,000
这件事一定要把紧口风
We have to be ready against any loose
ends this story might have

756
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:12,000
-所以如果大家都同意的话...
-So if everyone agrees...
-周一一定把钱给你
-I'm sure that the money will arrive you on monday...

757
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:14,000
但是这得从给你的那一百万里出
But it comes out of the money
we talked earlier

758
01:20:14,000 --> 01:20:15,000
我不会再多给一个子儿
I'm not paying one more cent

759
01:20:15,000 --> 01:20:16,000
Mauricio，别这样
Mauricio, please stop

760
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:20,000
真的，别这样，我也想这样说，别这样
Exactly. Please stop! That's the same
thing I want to say. Please stop

761
01:20:20,460 --> 01:20:22,760
要明白现在事情这么复杂
Understand that I'm in a complicated situation

762
01:20:22,760 --> 01:20:25,510
但是我不会让你这样拿走我的钱
But I'm not going to let you
take my money like these

763
01:20:26,010 --> 01:20:28,640
Mauricio，律师说得有理
Mauricio. What the attorney is saying
is understandable

764
01:20:28,970 --> 01:20:32,020
别为三万美元斤斤计较
Don't let yourself go by 30,000 dollars

765
01:20:32,020 --> 01:20:33,810
那你自己给他啊
Then pay them yourself

766
01:20:33,810 --> 01:20:35,060
从我给你的钱里出
Pay them from your part

767
01:20:37,770 --> 01:20:40,400
先生们，现在不是讨论这个的时候
Gentlemen, this is not the time for
a discussion like this

768
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:42,320
你想要做个了结，现在正是时候
If you want to finish, this is the time

769
01:20:42,320 --> 01:20:45,530
或者为什么不从给你的钱里出，你也能拿一百万美元
Or why doesn't it come from your part.
You'll collect from this a million dollars

770
01:20:45,530 --> 01:20:48,320
你还多要了三万美元
And you are asking me 30,000 more
for expenses

771
01:20:48,320 --> 01:20:49,950
谁还拿了一百万美元？
Who is getting a million dollars?

772
01:20:54,870 --> 01:20:56,960
不，他是对的
No. He's right.

773
01:20:57,830 --> 01:21:01,040
就从那一百万里出
The million dollars includes expenses

774
01:21:01,040 --> 01:21:04,710
打点费加给你的钱一共一百万
The expenses plus your part adds up
to a million

775
01:21:04,710 --> 01:21:06,340
别动我那份钱，好吗
Don't touch my part, all right?

776
01:21:08,970 --> 01:21:10,260
你们猜怎么样，伙计们
You know what, guys?

777
01:21:11,600 --> 01:21:13,600
我受够了，没有商量的余地了
I'm done with this. There's no deal

778
01:21:14,060 --> 01:21:17,020
别这样，Mauricio，什么叫没有商量的余地了？
No. Mauricio, what do you mean there's no deal

779
01:21:17,020 --> 01:21:19,400
就这样，就这样，我不会给钱了
It's done. It's done. It's no more.

780
01:21:19,400 --> 01:21:21,230
我谁的钱也不给了
They'll be nothing for anyone.

781
01:21:21,230 --> 01:21:22,570
所有人的钱
Anyone!

782
01:21:23,020 --> 01:21:24,280
Santiago!

783
01:21:25,530 --> 01:21:27,530
你愿意认罪吗
Didn't you want to confess what you did?

784
01:21:27,530 --> 01:21:30,780
很好，出去认罪吧
Sounds perfect. Go outside and do it.

785
01:21:30,780 --> 01:21:32,410
我给了你最好的教育
I gave you the best education.

786
01:21:32,410 --> 01:21:36,870
但你总是我行我素，现在快滚吧
And you always did whatever you wanted.
So now go fuck yourself!

787
01:21:36,870 --> 01:21:38,120
Mauricio.

788
01:21:38,710 --> 01:21:39,920
Mauricio.

789
01:21:41,250 --> 01:21:43,800
Mauricio，冷静地，我们再商量商量
Mauricio, calm down. Could we talked about it!

790
01:21:43,800 --> 01:21:46,380
发生什么了
What happend? What happened?

791
01:21:46,380 --> 01:21:48,090
他们就是群见钱眼开没人性的家伙
They are all a bunch of vultures.

792
01:21:48,090 --> 01:21:49,300
就这样了
That happened.

793
01:21:49,300 --> 01:21:51,300
不过都结束了，我可没撞死任何人
But it's over. I did not kill anyone.

794
01:21:51,300 --> 01:21:54,560
Mauricio别这样，求你了
Mauricio I'm asking you, please!

795
01:21:55,600 --> 01:22:00,140
今早我们在San Isidro的市中心，就是这起悲剧发生的地方
We are in the heart of San Isidro
where a tragic accident happened this morning...

796
01:22:27,130 --> 01:22:28,170
Mauricio.

797
01:22:28,170 --> 01:22:31,220
打开门，我有很重要的事要告诉你
Can you open the door? I have something important to tell you.

798
01:22:32,510 --> 01:22:33,640
Mauricio.

799
01:22:33,890 --> 01:22:36,350
我们能像文明人一样谈谈吗
Can we talk in a civilized way?

800
01:22:37,060 --> 01:22:38,180
怎么了
What's up?

801
01:22:38,180 --> 01:22:42,150
我们说好了，三万美元就能付清一切
It's done. We reached into an agreement
and the 30,000 dollars will be paid by all.

802
01:22:42,150 --> 01:22:45,900
我什么也不想听了，都结束了，滚出我的房子
I don't want to hear anything else. It's over! Get out of my house.

803
01:22:46,190 --> 01:22:48,610
我提醒你这可是一尸两命
Mauricio I remind you that there were two deaths.

804
01:22:48,610 --> 01:22:52,530
如果Santiago被定罪了，我们会付更多的钱
If Santiago is found guilty this will cost us
a lot more.

805
01:22:52,990 --> 01:22:55,410
然而，Jose很穷
However, José, is poor.

806
01:22:55,410 --> 01:22:58,660
谁会赔偿死者家属呢
So who is going to pay the victims' families?

807
01:22:58,660 --> 01:23:01,210
钱要给他们
The money should go there.

808
01:23:01,210 --> 01:23:04,250
那个废物的工资是我给的
This piece of garbage has a salary that
comes out of my taxes.

809
01:23:04,250 --> 01:23:05,840
好好想想是怎么回事
Go find out what happened.

810
01:23:05,840 --> 01:23:10,630
你想给我儿子辩护，让他付律师费。要是他付得起，那也行
You want to defend my son, set your fees with him.
If he can afford it, I'm fine with it.

811
01:23:10,630 --> 01:23:13,380
做你该做的事，辩护去
Do what you have to do. Go talk!

812
01:23:13,380 --> 01:23:17,640
停在，我们已经商量好了，一个绅士可不会这样反悔的
Look. We already had a deal. 
A gentleman wouldn't get out of it like this.

813
01:23:19,140 --> 01:23:21,060
如果冒犯了真是对不起
I ask  for apologies if I offended you.

814
01:23:21,060 --> 01:23:25,190
但是从我到这儿，我做的可只有为你的家庭辩护
But since I am here, I haven't done nothing else 
but to defend your family.

815
01:23:25,190 --> 01:23:27,980
真是谢谢你了，你可真是上帝派来的天使
I thank you a lot! You are an angel from God!

816
01:23:38,240 --> 01:23:40,040
我能和他们谈谈吗
Will you let me talk to them?

817
01:23:40,040 --> 01:23:42,540
也许有更好的解决办法
To see if I can improve the situation.

818
01:23:45,880 --> 01:23:46,880
不好意思
Excuse me.

819
01:23:50,170 --> 01:23:51,210
怎么了
Well.

820
01:23:51,590 --> 01:23:54,130
我们有个更好的建议
I think we have a better proposal.

821
01:23:54,590 --> 01:24:00,270
Jose愿意只要最初商定的五十万并且不要公寓了
José will accept the initial 500,000
and says you should forget the appartment.

822
01:24:00,850 --> 01:24:04,520
我和律师一共一百万，不会再多一分钱
The attorney and I will share a million. The end. 
Not one more cent.

823
01:24:04,520 --> 01:24:08,060
我们得快行动了，媒体都在外面
We have to do it now, Mauricio. The news is outside.

824
01:24:08,360 --> 01:24:12,440
律师说警察那儿不能再拖了
And the attorney says that he cannot delay
anymore the entrance of the police officer.

825
01:24:14,110 --> 01:24:14,860
不行
No.

826
01:24:15,950 --> 01:24:18,580
我一共给一百万
I'll pay a million in total.

827
01:24:18,580 --> 01:24:20,580
你们自己随便分
And you share it however you want.

828
01:24:20,580 --> 01:24:23,540
-怎么只有一百万了
-How come just a million? 
-就这么多，爱要不要
-It's that or nothing.

829
01:24:23,540 --> 01:24:25,710
行不行随你
If you like it, fine. If not, go away.

830
01:24:26,120 --> 01:24:30,340
你们要是再有什么新花招，我就告你勒索
If you hit the door with any other deal
and I'll denounce you for extortion.

831
01:24:30,340 --> 01:24:31,800
你和那个律师一起告
TYou and the attorney.

832
01:24:36,800 --> 01:24:39,350
先生，你能透露肇事者的身份吗
Mr. Could yo reveal us the identity of the assassin?

833
01:24:39,350 --> 01:24:43,560
现在无可奉告，我只能说案子基本有了结果
At the moment nothing will be said.
The only thing I can say is that the case is practically solved.

834
01:24:43,560 --> 01:24:47,100
只有一个嫌疑人，他会受到法庭的判决
There is one single suspect and in a few moments
he will be presented to the judge

835
01:24:47,100 --> 01:24:48,190
谢谢
Thank you very much.

836
01:25:32,480 --> 01:25:34,280
Baldie，你每张照片里都光着身子
Baldie, you are naked in every picture!

837
01:25:45,250 --> 01:25:46,580
现在
And now,

838
01:25:47,500 --> 01:25:49,040
时候终于到了
The time has come

839
01:25:49,040 --> 01:25:50,880
请全体起立
To stand up

840
01:25:50,880 --> 01:25:53,250
欢迎

841
01:25:53,250 --> 01:25:55,840

Romina和Ariel
Romina and Ariel.

843
01:26:36,380 --> 01:26:39,170
我把岳父交给你了
I'll leave you my father-in-law.

844
01:26:41,180 --> 01:26:42,390
我会盯着你的
I'll watch you

845
01:26:42,970 --> 01:26:44,180
我可看着你呢
I'm looking at you

846
01:26:44,800 --> 01:26:46,680
是的，是的
Yes, yes

847
01:26:49,640 --> 01:26:51,560
谢谢
Thank you!

848
01:26:52,940 --> 01:26:54,650
祝你今晚愉快
I wish you a happy evening!

849
01:26:54,650 --> 01:26:56,190

850
01:28:23,440 --> 01:28:25,820
大家看镜头
Everybody look at the camera.

851
01:28:28,120 --> 01:28:29,330
威士忌
Whisky.

852
01:28:29,330 --> 01:28:31,330
威士忌
Whisky!

853
01:28:31,330 --> 01:28:32,830
大家笑一笑
Let's see a smile.

854

玩儿得开心
Well, enjoy.

857
01:28:43,380 --> 01:28:44,970
Romina.

858
01:28:45,470 --> 01:28:46,470
嗯？
Yes?

859
01:28:47,220 --> 01:28:49,760
有个小礼物要给你
Here's a little present for you.

860
01:28:49,760 --> 01:28:53,810
别这样，不用的
Oh, please. You didn't have to.

861
01:28:53,810 --> 01:28:56,190
你能来就是很好的礼物了
The gift here is that you came.

862
01:28:56,190 --> 01:28:59,110
-你们玩的开心吗
-Are you having fun?
-很开心
-Everything's beautiful.

863
01:28:59,110 --> 01:29:03,280
你们一家人又善良又有趣
Your family is very kind and funny.

864
01:29:03,280 --> 01:29:06,030
就是乡下治安不好
It's a shame the insecurity in the country

865
01:29:06,030 --> 01:29:10,240
昨晚几个小偷趁他不注意偷走了钱包
Last night some burglars robbed his wallet
without him noticing.

866
01:29:10,240 --> 01:29:13,290
天啊，真不敢相信
Oh, I can't believe it.

867
01:29:13,290 --> 01:29:16,580
太糟糕了，不过，事情会慢慢...
Sounds terrible. Oh well, little by little...

868
01:29:17,670 --> 01:29:20,840
-那些人，他们是你们的朋友吗
-Beautiful people. Are they friends?
-是的 
-Yes.

869
01:29:21,750 --> 01:29:25,630
好吧，那桌是乡下俱乐部的
Okay. That's the table of the guys from the country club.

870
01:29:25,630 --> 01:29:29,800
我们13年没见了，不过通过脸书找到了他们
We had not seen each other for 13 years 
but met up thanks to Facebook.

871
01:29:29,800 --> 01:29:31,220
脸书
With Facebook.

872
01:29:32,220 --> 01:29:36,140
后面的那些人是大学同学和她们的男朋友
The ones in the back are college friends with their boyfriends.

873
01:29:36,430 --> 01:29:38,100
当然，有男朋友的才能带男朋友来，对吧
Well, the ones who have. Right?

874
01:29:39,270 --> 01:29:40,770
那些是...
Those are ...

875
01:29:40,770 --> 01:29:43,230
Ariel的同事
Coworkers of Ariel.

876
01:29:45,900 --> 01:29:47,110
玩的开心吗
Are you having fun?

877
01:29:47,700 --> 01:29:49,410
当然，你呢
Yes, you?

878
01:29:49,410 --> 01:29:50,450
也是
Yes.

879
01:29:50,870 --> 01:29:53,410
一切都...有板有眼的
Everything's very ... standard.

880
01:29:54,830 --> 01:29:56,410
你真幽默
Your so much fun

881
01:29:59,250 --> 01:30:02,040
-玩的开心
-Have fun. 
-你也是
-You too.

882
01:30:05,880 --> 01:30:10,010
你知道有什么学探戈的好地方吗
Do you know a good place to learn tango?

883
01:30:10,430 --> 01:30:12,140
是...不知道
Yeah ... No.

884
01:30:12,140 --> 01:30:14,140
不过我表妹肯定知道
No, but I assure you that my cousin does.

885
01:30:14,140 --> 01:30:15,850
我把她找来
I'll present her to you.

886
01:30:50,010 --> 01:30:51,470
你好
Hello.

887
01:31:11,820 --> 01:31:13,240
你好
Hello.

888
01:31:13,700 --> 01:31:15,120
你好
Hello.

889
01:31:18,080 --> 01:31:19,790
哦，妈的
Oh, fuck.

890
01:31:19,790 --> 01:31:21,500
怎么了
What happened?

891
01:31:22,210 --> 01:31:24,580
我把酒拿走？
But... I'll take away the wine?

892
01:31:24,580 --> 01:31:28,050
不，不是因为酒
No, it's not the wine.

893
01:31:28,500 --> 01:31:31,670
别说话，别说话
Shut up, shut up

894
01:31:31,670 --> 01:31:33,510

895
01:31:33,510 --> 01:31:35,600

896
01:31:43,140 --> 01:31:44,440

897
01:32:20,180 --> 01:32:23,060
Ariel，是那个长头发的女孩？
Ariel, what's the name of the girl with long hair?

898
01:32:23,480 --> 01:32:25,270
-哪个
-Which One?
-那个 
-That one.

899
01:32:25,270 --> 01:32:27,230
你的同事
Your coworker.

900
01:32:31,190 --> 01:32:32,360
Lourdes.

901
01:32:33,280 --> 01:32:34,240
怎么了
Why?

902
01:32:34,240 --> 01:32:36,740
没事
No. No.

903
01:32:39,490 --> 01:32:42,160
还有Lourdes怎么认识你的吉他老师
And how does Lourdes knows your guitar teacher?

904
01:32:43,660 --> 01:32:46,210
什么，我的吉他老师
What, my guitar teacher?

905
01:32:47,210 --> 01:32:53,510
我几个月前问你这是谁的号码，你说是吉他老师的
When I asked you a couple of months ago about this number,
you said it was your guitar teacher.

906
01:32:53,880 --> 01:32:56,050
我觉得奇怪就存了那个号码
Since I found it strange I saved the number.

907
01:32:56,050 --> 01:32:59,350
我给你吉他老师打电话竟然是那个叫Lourdes的女孩接的，真是奇怪，不是吗
And it's weird that when I call him this girl, Lourdes, answers.
Right?

908
01:33:01,260 --> 01:33:04,850
-我不知道你在说什么
-I have no idea what you're talking about. 
-你不知道我在说什么？
-You don't know what I'm talking about?

909
01:33:05,190 --> 01:33:06,600
我是说，Ariel
About that, Ariel

910
01:33:06,600 --> 01:33:09,310
有那么多手机公司
That with all the celular companies that exist

911
01:33:09,310 --> 01:33:13,990
生产的那么多手机，怎么那个女孩的手机号会跟你吉他老师的号是一样的
And all the promotions they have, it's weird that this girl
has the same telephone number as your guitar teacher.

912
01:33:14,530 --> 01:33:16,650
特别是他们从没见过
Especially if they have never met

913
01:33:16,650 --> 01:33:18,740
这真是个巧合
Isn't it an incredible coincidence?.

914
01:33:21,120 --> 01:33:22,580
-所以呢
-So?
-什么
-What?

915
01:33:22,580 --> 01:33:25,370
给我个答案，否则我就去问她
Give me an answer, or otherwise I'll go ask her.

916
01:33:25,370 --> 01:33:27,330
-Romi,别...
-Romi, please ... 
-Romi也他妈的是你叫的？
-"Romi" Fuck off!

917
01:33:27,330 --> 01:33:29,210
回答我
Answer my question.

918
01:33:30,630 --> 01:33:31,670
Ariel

919
01:33:31,880 --> 01:33:35,010
27号桌所有人是不是都知道你和那个女孩鬼混过
Does the entire table 27 knows that you've fucked that girl?

920
01:33:36,050 --> 01:33:40,010
你把这些混蛋都请到婚礼上了？你干了什么？
Did you invite all those assholes to our marriage? What did you do?

921
01:33:40,180 --> 01:33:42,510
对不起打扰一下
Sorry to interrupt.

922
01:33:42,510 --> 01:33:45,430
能和我们的王子跳个舞吗
Would allow me a dance with the prince?

923
01:33:45,430 --> 01:33:47,060
当然，我的皇后
Of course. My queen!

924
01:33:47,560 --> 01:33:49,270
你的王子在这儿
Here is your prince.

925
01:33:54,190 --> 01:33:56,400
怎么了
What happened?

926
01:34:06,250 --> 01:34:07,500
Romi，你还好吗
Romi, are you okay?

927
01:34:10,830 --> 01:34:12,250
怎么了
What happened?

928
01:34:13,000 --> 01:34:14,550
稍等
One second, please.

929
01:34:17,090 --> 01:34:18,340
Romi.

930
01:34:19,470 --> 01:34:22,600
Baldie，能让我和她再跳一支舞吗
Baldie, would you let me one more dance?

931
01:34:33,270 --> 01:34:34,360
我亲爱的
My love.

932
01:34:35,820 --> 01:34:37,110
亲爱的，停下
Honey, stop it.

933
01:34:37,110 --> 01:34:38,820
高兴点
Let's enjoy the party.

934
01:34:41,740 --> 01:34:43,660
你和那个婊子在一起吗
Were you with that bitch?

935
01:34:47,000 --> 01:34:48,710
求你了，别这样
Please, I beg you!

936
01:34:49,580 --> 01:34:51,080
我得知道
I need to know!

937
01:34:56,880 --> 01:34:58,130
是的，我是和她在一起
Yes, I was.

938
01:35:00,680 --> 01:35:03,550
但对我来说这什么也不算
But for me it meant absolutely nothing.

939
01:35:04,350 --> 01:35:08,430
Romi，这么多人这样不好
Romi, please don't make a scene in front of everyone.

940
01:35:08,430 --> 01:35:11,060
我太蠢了，对不起，我错了
I was stupid. I'm sorry. I made a mistake.

941
01:35:11,060 --> 01:35:12,350
我想一个人静静
I want to be alone.

942
01:36:02,200 --> 01:36:04,200
-怎么了
-What's up? 
-你看见她了吗
-Did you see her?

943
01:36:04,200 --> 01:36:05,740
你问我？
You are asking me?

944
01:36:23,630 --> 01:36:24,840
你还好吗
Are you all right?

945
01:36:30,100 --> 01:36:31,770
我需要叫谁过来吗
Should I call someone?

946
01:36:36,860 --> 01:36:37,940
但是你还好吗
But are you okay?

947
01:36:41,280 --> 01:36:42,740
你肯定不好
Obviously you're not.

948
01:36:42,740 --> 01:36:43,990
不
No.

949
01:36:44,900 --> 01:36:46,660
冷静，怎么了
Calm down, what happened?

950
01:36:46,660 --> 01:36:52,370
我刚知道我丈夫在和一个婚礼上的客人偷情
I just learned that my husband is cheating on me with another guest.

951
01:36:52,370 --> 01:36:53,710
哦，那太糟了
Oh, that's bad.

952
01:36:55,080 --> 01:36:57,420
我知道该怎么办
And now I don't know what to do.

953
01:36:57,420 --> 01:37:00,210
那么多人都看着
With all the people there.

954
01:37:01,420 --> 01:37:03,880
放松，这种事情经常发生
Relax, these things happen.

955
01:37:03,880 --> 01:37:05,550
时间过去就好了
They're overcomed with time.

956
01:37:05,550 --> 01:37:07,220
给你
Here.

957
01:37:10,510 --> 01:37:12,640
如果你爱他，从长远角度来想你要原谅他
If you want him, on the long run you'll be able to forgive him.

958
01:37:13,770 --> 01:37:16,900
-你爱他吗
-If hee is your husband. 
我不知道我爱不爱他
-No, I do not know if he is what I want.

959
01:37:19,440 --> 01:37:21,400
我不知道他是不是对的人
I don't know if he's my man.

960
01:37:22,480 --> 01:37:24,570
他就是个混蛋
He is an asshole.

961
01:37:24,570 --> 01:37:25,780
哦，好吧
Oh, well.

962
01:37:26,150 --> 01:37:28,240
这样的话抓好机会
In that case take the opportunity.

963
01:37:28,240 --> 01:37:32,200
别担心那些客人，你不是第一个被伴侣背叛的人
And th guests? Well, don't feel like you were the first ont to be cheated on.

964
01:37:32,950 --> 01:37:36,370
还有，你要是太在意别人怎么想...
Also, if you are going to care so much of what others say then ...

965
01:37:36,830 --> 01:37:38,630
你就完了，亲爱的
You're done, darling

966
01:37:41,790 --> 01:37:43,000
好点了吗
Are we cool?

967
01:37:45,300 --> 01:37:46,050
听着
Look.

968
01:37:47,220 --> 01:37:49,340
如果我是你我就回去
If I was you I go there.

969
01:37:49,720 --> 01:37:52,510
让婚礼快点结束
I accelerate everything so the party finishes early,

970
01:37:52,680 --> 01:37:55,230
然后，第二天晚上
and then, the next night at home,

971
01:37:55,230 --> 01:37:58,140
你就和他分手。你经历的事情很糟糕
you break up with him. What happened to you is terrible.

972
01:37:58,350 --> 01:37:59,690
我不否认
I will not deny it.

973
01:38:01,150 --> 01:38:02,570
但是生活需要继续
But you must move forward.

974
01:38:06,360 --> 01:38:07,360
好点了吗
Better?

975
01:39:23,100 --> 01:39:24,810
Romina?

976
01:39:26,150 --> 01:39:29,530
你现在就离开这儿，什么也不要说
You leave right now from here and you don't say a word!

977
01:39:29,900 --> 01:39:32,110
你不明白你惹了谁
You don't have any idea of who you are dealing with!

978
01:39:32,950 --> 01:39:35,280
我要拿走你所有的钱
I'll get every cent from you,

979
01:39:35,280 --> 01:39:41,040
为了逃避财务部，我会拿走你父亲给你买的每一处房产
I'll get every single property that your father has bought for you
 in order to evade the Treasury.

980
01:39:41,040 --> 01:39:42,290
我们可结婚了呀
We are married,

981
01:39:42,500 --> 01:39:44,710
合法婚姻
Legally married.

982
01:39:44,710 --> 01:39:49,460
我会和那些即使只在乎我一点点的人睡觉
I will dedicate my days to sleep with every person who gives a minimum shit about me.

983
01:39:49,460 --> 01:39:52,180
不管是谁，只要有一点点爱我就行
With whoever who gives me athe most little gram of love.

984
01:39:52,180 --> 01:39:54,470
当你想离婚的时候
And when you want to have a divorce,

985
01:39:54,470 --> 01:39:56,140
我要去上几节表演课
I'll take acting classes

986
01:39:56,140 --> 01:39:58,930
在法官面前装可怜
to sit in front of the judge with a puppy face,

987
01:39:58,930 --> 01:40:01,430
告诉他我在抵抗，在挣扎
and tell him that I'm fighting, I'm struggling.

988
01:40:01,430 --> 01:40:04,310
这样我们的婚姻就会无限期地延长
That way our marriage is prolonged indefinitely.

989
01:40:04,600 --> 01:40:07,610
我要在脸书上泄露你所有的秘密
I will divulge all your secrets through Facebook,

990
01:40:07,610 --> 01:40:11,150
我要折磨到你痛不欲生
I'll put my finger in the cut and stir it until cry you of pain.

991
01:40:11,440 --> 01:40:13,990
你要受到巨大的羞辱
You'll go through so many humiliations,

992
01:40:13,990 --> 01:40:18,280
你逃脱的唯一方法就是跳下这阳台
that your only escape will be throw yourself off the balcony.

993
01:40:18,280 --> 01:40:21,120
到那时候，死亡将我们分开
And then, when death do us part,

994
01:40:21,580 --> 01:40:24,040
你的死将我们分开
when YOUR death do us part,

995
01:40:24,040 --> 01:40:25,460
我就得到了一切
I'm getting with everything.

996
01:40:28,960 --> 01:40:29,840
Ariel!

997
01:40:30,880 --> 01:40:32,670
Ariel,冷静
Ariel, calm down.

998
01:40:32,840 --> 01:40:33,970
快走，瘦猴儿
Come on, skinny.

999
01:40:35,510 --> 01:40:36,640
快走，快走
Go, go.

1000
01:40:38,680 --> 01:40:39,720
Ariel.

1001
01:40:55,570 --> 01:40:58,490
小婊砸，你上哪儿了？你还好吗？
Bitch! Where were you? Everything's okay?

1002
01:41:15,050 --> 01:41:16,470
放我下来，你们这群混蛋
Bring me down, assholes!

1003
01:41:16,590 --> 01:41:19,430
你们疯了，听不见吗
Idiots! Are you listening?!

1004
01:41:19,430 --> 01:41:21,890
放我下来
Get me off!

1005
01:41:24,270 --> 01:41:27,350
放我下来
Get me off!

1006
01:41:27,350 --> 01:41:29,270
他在说什么？
What is he saying?

1007
01:41:29,270 --> 01:41:33,230
-Ariel，当心
-Ariel, watch out. 
-操你妈的
-Fuck you!

1008
01:41:42,370 --> 01:41:43,830
混蛋
Asshole!

1009
01:41:49,630 --> 01:41:51,880
放我下来
Bring me down!

1010
01:42:44,760 --> 01:42:46,680
你要走了吗
Are you already leaving?

1011
01:42:47,560 --> 01:42:49,890
别啊，来玩啊
Please, no. Come.

1012
01:42:49,890 --> 01:42:52,730
-不了，这...
-No, it's ... 
-真的，没事儿
-Seriously, everything's fine

1013
01:42:52,730 --> 01:42:54,360
来啊，Lour
Come with me, Lour.

1014
01:43:05,370 --> 01:43:07,250
快停下，我好晕
Please stop. I'm getting dizzy.

1015
01:43:07,250 --> 01:43:09,620
这太棒了
This is great!

1016
01:43:10,370 --> 01:43:11,920
真的，快停下
Stop it! Seriously!

1017
01:43:11,920 --> 01:43:15,380
你去过我们的俱乐部吗？或者你还太小？
Did you used to go to our club, or were you younger.

1018
01:43:15,380 --> 01:43:18,880
你知道俱乐部是因为有人被打了才关的吗
Did you know that they closed it because
someone got kicked there?.

1019
01:43:28,560 --> 01:43:33,270
她威胁他说她要拿走他的每一处房产
She threatened him saying she was going to get everything
up to his last property.

1020
01:43:33,270 --> 01:43:35,980
是的，这样更好
...Yes, it's better.

1021
01:43:35,980 --> 01:43:37,980
我为发生的事情感到抱歉
I'm deeply sorry for what happened.

1022
01:43:37,980 --> 01:43:40,530
不过，婚礼很棒
However, the party was wonderful.

1023
01:43:41,530 --> 01:43:42,860
不好意思
Excuse me, please.

1024
01:43:42,860 --> 01:43:45,120
大多数都是皮外伤
Most of wounds are superficial.

1025
01:43:45,240 --> 01:43:46,740
会好的

1026
01:43:46,740 --> 01:43:50,000
不过我们还是要检查一下有没有肌腱被割断

她上保险了吗

1028
01:43:53,210 --> 01:43:55,880
Romina，别这样
Romina, Please ...

我就是想知道她上保险了吗

我们来玩蛋糕吧

01:44:56,020 --> 01:44:57,150
Romi.

1043
01:44:58,650 --> 01:45:01,360
我的天啊，Mili，你？

1044
01:45:01,360 --> 01:45:03,530
我不敢相信
I can't believe it.

1045

我要和Mili拍照

拍照

1048

哦，不是,Romi!
Oh, no, Romi!

1049
01:45:17,630 --> 01:45:20,300
让大家看看这一切都是假的
Let's show that everything here is a lie,

1050
01:45:20,710 --> 01:45:22,590
但是戒指是真的
but that the ring is true.

1051
01:45:22,590 --> 01:45:24,880
这不是很棒吗
Wouldn't it be great?

1052
01:45:24,880 --> 01:45:26,180
Romi,别这样
Romi, stop

1053
01:45:26,180 --> 01:45:29,890
吻她，吻她
Kiss her! Kiss her!

1054
01:45:29,890 --> 01:45:31,640

1055
01:45:31,640 --> 01:45:33,430

1056
01:45:33,430 --> 01:45:35,270
-Romina
-Romina. 
-怎么了

花束送来了，狂欢也要开始了

为什么，问什么你一副苦瓜脸
But why? Why are you being so bitter?

1062
01:45:47,660 --> 01:45:49,320
姑娘们，接着！
Girls, here it goes!

1063
01:45:51,450 --> 01:45:54,200
熏牛肉还没上呢，不是吗
We are also missing the pastrami, right?

1064
01:45:54,200 --> 01:45:55,910
你知道我们花了多少钱吗
You know how much did it cost?

1065
01:45:56,410 --> 01:45:57,790
说实话，Ariel
Say the truth, Ariel.

1066
01:45:57,790 --> 01:46:02,250
我们为熏牛肉争执了一个星期
We argued for a whole week about the hot pastrami.

1067

我们已经买了就要吃了它，这不对吗，先生？
We decided to pay for it and now I want to eat it. Is it possible, sir?

1068
01:46:05,510 --> 01:46:07,880
Romina,别这样
Romina. Stop!

1069
01:46:07,880 --> 01:46:09,720
让大家回家吧
Let the people go home.

1070
01:46:09,720 --> 01:46:11,890
你不是在犯傻吗
Isn't it a stupid thing what you are doing now?

1071
01:46:12,100 --> 01:46:15,850
给你个建议，我家的律师说我们可以告你威胁我们
To give you an idea, my family lawyer says we should sue you for threats you made.

1072
01:46:24,190 --> 01:46:27,400
别告诉我这是你妈妈的主意
Don't tell me this was a plan from your mom.

1073
01:46:27,780 --> 01:46:29,990
Romina,我是认真的，别这样了
Romina, seriously. Cut it.

1074
01:46:30,700 --> 01:46:32,870
你妈妈真是个...
Your mom is a real ...

01:46:32,870 --> 01:46:35,910
-婚礼策划者
-wedding planner.
-停下
-Stop it!

1076
01:46:38,080 --> 01:46:39,830
我对你做了什么
What did I do to you?!

1077
01:46:40,170 --> 01:46:43,340
对于你做的那些事来说，我做的事简直不足挂齿
I didn't do anything compared to what you're doing to me!

1078
01:46:51,800 --> 01:46:52,800
亲爱的

01:47:01,860 --> 01:47:02,900

1082
01:47:04,020 --> 01:47:05,730
我的天啊
Oh my God ...

1083
01:47:07,860 --> 01:47:09,740

如果我能找到一个值得我嫁的男人
If I get a guy who's worth it,

1089
01:47:29,920 --> 01:47:33,340
我要把这一幕放在大屏幕上
I'll put this as a blooper on the big screen.

1090

不

01:47:35,810 --> 01:47:38,600
我还要和我的孩子一起看
I'll even watch this with my kids.

1092
01:47:38,600 --> 01:47:42,690
除了该死的《爱探险的朵拉》，我还要放这段视频
Instead of fucking Dora The Explorer, I'll put this video.

1093
01:47:44,730 --> 01:47:46,270
我知道
I know!

1094

我要把这段电子影像连着播放
I'll put in those electronic portraits that go on a loop

1095

整天都放

01:47:56,280 --> 01:47:58,410

1097
01:47:58,410 --> 01:47:59,410
把你的手从我女儿身上拿开，贱货
Get your hands off my daughter, bitch!

1098
01:47:59,410 --> 01:48:01,330
你最好滚开
You better get the fuck away

1099

照顾好那位女士，你去看看那个先生
