1
00:01:28,900 --> 00:01:31,070
"真是多谢!"

2
00:01:33,350 --> 00:01:35,880
"前往蒙太克的火车在B站台"

3

2004年情人节  偶然的想法

4
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:44,630
今天是贺卡公司发明的节日...

5
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:46,630
"最后一次播报"
Last call...

6
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:49,190
好让人们感觉像废物
to make people feel like crap.

7
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:53,860
我今天没去上班
I ditched work today.

8
00:01:55,310 --> 00:01:57,300
而是坐上了去蒙太克的火车
Took a train out to Montauk.

9
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:00,070
"请到B站台搭乘前往蒙太克的火车"

10
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:02,740
我不知道原因
I don 't know why.

11
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:05,980
我不是一个冲动的人
Aah! I'm not an impulsive person.

12
00:02:13,660 --> 00:02:17,360
我想只是今早醒来有些茫然失措
I guess I just woke up in a funk this morning.

13
00:02:17,430 --> 00:02:19,760
我得把车送去修理
I gotta get my car fixed.

14
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:21,770
你好  辛迪
Hi. Cindy?

15
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:24,270

16
00:02:24,340 --> 00:02:28,300
听着  我今天感觉不舒服
Listen, I don't feel very well today.

17
00:02:28,380 --> 00:02:30,310
不  我想是食物中毒
No, food poisoning, I think.

18
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:33,870
这海滩实在是冷死人
It's goddamn fireezing on this beach.

19
00:02:33,950 --> 00:02:36,510
二月份的蒙太克...  真是不错  约耳

被撕掉的页

不记得自己撕过
Don't remember doing that.

22
00:02:45,430 --> 00:02:48,920
这好像是我两年来的头一次记录
It appears this is my, fiirst entry. in two years.

23
00:02:57,740 --> 00:02:59,730
不要过度赞美细沙
Sand is overrated.

24
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:02,930
它们不过是细小的岩石
It's just tiny, little rocks.

25
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:15,240
希望我能结识新的伴侣
Ifionly, I could meet someone new.

26
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:19,190
但我想这样的机会很小
I guess my, chances of that happening are some what diminished,

27
00:03:19,260 --> 00:03:23,860
我不敢和眼前这陌生女人 做目光的接触
seeing that I'm incapable of making eye contact with a woman I don't know.

28
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:28,130
也许我该和内奥米重修旧好
Maybe I should get back together with Naomi.

29
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:30,900
她很美丽  美丽就是好
She was nice. Nice is good.

30
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:35,470
她爱过我
She loved me.

31
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:15,580
为什么我总是爱上每个...
Why, do I fall in love with every woman I see...

32
00:04:15,650 --> 00:04:18,520
对我稍加注意的女人?
who shows me the least bit of attention?

33
00:05:00,690 --> 00:05:02,590
你说什么?
I'm sorry?

34
00:05:02,660 --> 00:05:06,330
-我只是问好  -嗨  你好
-I just said hi. - Hi. Hello. Hi.

35
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:10,060
我可以坐近些吗?
Okay if I sit closer?

36
00:05:11,200 --> 00:05:13,140
你到哪儿去?
How far are you going?

37
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:15,470
嗯  洛克威尔中心
Uh, Rockville Center.

38
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:17,840
不会吧!  我也是!
Get out! Me too!

39
00:05:17,910 --> 00:05:20,850
-真的?  -真巧
Really? What are the odds?

40
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:25,070
我认识你吗?
Do I knowyou?

41
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:29,820
你是不是在巴恩斯·洛贝尔店买过书?
Doyou ever shop at Barnes & Noble?

42
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:32,020
-是的  -那就对了!
Sure. Sure. That's it!

43
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:34,460
-什么?  -我以前见过你
Yeah? I've seen you, man!

44
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:38,690
我在那里作售书员已经五年了
Book slave there for, like, five years now.

45
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:42,130
-啊  我想我可能记得你  -天  是五年吗?
Ah. I would have thought I would've remembered you. Jesus! Is it five years?

46
00:05:42,200 --> 00:05:44,300
可能是头发的缘故
It might be the hair.

47
00:05:44,370 --> 00:05:46,500
-可能什么?  -发型改变了很多
What might? It changes a lot.

48
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:49,870
我改变了发型的颜色  那就是你没认出我来的原因
The color. That's whyyou might not recognize me.

49
00:05:49,940 --> 00:05:53,610
-这发型颜色叫"蓝色废墟"  -很对
It's called Blue Ruin, the color. Right. Yeah.

50
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,010
-很时髦的名字  对吧?  -我喜欢
Snappy name, huh? Ilike it.

51
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:01,650
这公司所做出的全色系的发型  名字都很时髦
Anyway, this company makes a whole line of colors with equally snappy names.

52
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:06,180
红色威胁、 黄色高烧、绿色革命
Red-- Red Menace, Yellow Fever, Green Revolution.

53
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:09,190
一定有专门职位来命名这些发型
That'd be a job, coming up with those names.

54
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:12,200
会有那样的工作吗?
You think there could possibly be a job like that?

55
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:15,790
我是说 总共才有多少种发型颜色呢? 也许十五种吧
I mean how many hair colors could there be? Fifty, maybe.

56
00:06:15,870 --> 00:06:17,890
有人在做这工作
Someone's got that job.

57
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:23,010
我能想出来的-桔色特工!
Agent Orange! I came up with that one.

58
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:25,980
我用发型颜色来表明我的个性
I apply my personality in a paste.

59
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:27,980
噢  我很怀疑
Oh, I doubt that very much.

60
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:30,540
因为你不认识我  那么...
Well, you don't know me, so...

61
00:06:31,750 --> 00:06:33,740
你并不了解我  对吧?
you don't know, do you?

62
00:06:36,590 --> 00:06:39,990
对不起  我只是想尽量显得友好些
Sorry. I was just-- I'm trying to be nice.

63
00:06:41,830 --> 00:06:43,820
好的  我明白了
Yeah. I got it.

64
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:06,320
-顺便提一下  我叫克莱门汀  -我叫约耳
My name's Clementine, by the way. I'm Joel.

65
00:07:06,390 --> 00:07:08,720

不  你不会那么做的  你想尽量友好些

68
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:18,690
我不知怎样取笑你的名字
I don't know anyjokes aboutyour name.

69
00:07:18,770 --> 00:07:20,930
腰浆果狗(卡通片名)
Huckleberry Hound.

70
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:23,560
我不知道那是什么
I don't know what that means.

71
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:26,770
你不知道腰浆果狗?  你白痴么?
Huckleberry Hound? What are you nuts?

72
00:07:26,840 --> 00:07:28,770
有人曾这样暗示过
It's been suggested.

73
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:31,940
我亲爱的 我亲爱的克莱门汀...
Oh, my darlin', oh, my darlin' Oh, my darlin' Clementine

76
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:38,720
知道了吗?
No?

77
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:42,720
对不起  但那真是个美丽的名字
I'm sorry. Just-- It's a pretty name, though. It really is nice.

78
00:07:42,790 --> 00:07:44,780
它的意思是...  "仁慈"
It's, uh-- It means "merciful."

79
00:07:44,860 --> 00:07:46,790
对吗 仁慈?
Right? Clemency?

80
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:49,060
虽然看上去不像
Although it hardly fits.

81
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:51,430
但说真的  我是一个报复心极强的小贱货
I'm a vindictive little bitch, truth be told.

82
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,930
我不会那样想
Gee, I wouldn't think that aboutyou.

83
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,200
-为什么?  -我不知道
Why wouldn't you think that about me? I don't know.

84
00:07:57,270 --> 00:07:59,500
我只是...
I just--

85
00:07:59,570 --> 00:08:01,910

你看上去是好人  那...
You seem nice, so--

87

噢  现在我成好人啦?
Oh, now I'm nice?

88
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,240
上帝!  难道你不会用别的形容词汇吗?
Oh, God. Don't you know any other adjectives?

89
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:11,250
我不需要好
I don't need "nice."

90
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:15,310
我不想对别人好  也不想别人对我好
I don't need myself to be it, and I don't need anybody else to be it at me.

91
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:20,150
约耳?
Joel?

92
00:08:21,260 --> 00:08:23,490

我今天有些不开心
I'm a little out of sorts today.

96
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:42,650
我得不好意思的承认...
My embarrassing admission is,

97
00:08:42,720 --> 00:08:45,650
我真的喜欢你对我好
I really like that you're nice right now.

98
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:50,550
我的意思是 我不知道下一时刻自己会喜欢什么
I mean, I can't tell from one moment to the next what I'm gonna like,

99
00:08:50,620 --> 00:08:52,620
但是现在
but right now...

100
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:55,750
我很高兴你对我好
I'm glad you are.

101
00:09:02,970 --> 00:09:07,130
我有很多事情  我也许该...

102
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:11,300
-我正在写作  -对不起
Oh! I'm sorry. Okay. I-I'm writing, and--

103

-不 不用...  -没什么
No, no. I just-- Sure. No. That's okay.

我只是得... 你知道... 这是... 好吧
I just have-- You know, this is-- Okay.

105

保重
- Take care, then.

106
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:20,680
老天!
Jesus!

107
00:09:33,630 --> 00:09:37,930
我可以送你一程 如果你需要的话
Hi. I could, uh, give you a ride, if you need.

-你不是在跟踪我吧?  -我没有
You're not a stalker or anything, right? I'm not a stalker.

112
00:09:46,810 --> 00:09:48,910
是你先和我说话的  还记得吗?
You're the one that talked to me. Remember?

113
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:51,250
那是跟踪守则中最老土的伎俩
That is the oldest trick in the stalker book.

114
00:09:51,320 --> 00:09:53,450
真的吗?  有这本书?
Really? There's a stalker book?

115
00:09:55,790 --> 00:09:58,120
好的  我会读读看
I gotta read that one.

116
00:10:02,930 --> 00:10:07,630
看... 我对刚才的疯狂表现感到抱歉  我并不是这样
Look, I'm sorry if I came off sorta nutso. I'm not, really.

117
00:10:07,700 --> 00:10:11,100
没什么  我没想过你是
Oh, it's okay. I didn't think you were.

118
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:19,810
你想喝一杯吗?
Did you wanna have a drink?

119
00:10:19,880 --> 00:10:22,070
我有很多种酒  我可以...
I have lots of drinks, and I could...

120
00:10:24,150 --> 00:10:26,080
算了
Never mind.

121
00:10:26,150 --> 00:10:28,520
-对不起 那真傻  真难为情  -不 不 不
Sorry. That was stupid. I'm embarrassed now. No, no, no, no.

晚安  约耳
Good night,Joel.

123

谢谢
Thank you.

125
00:10:55,050 --> 00:10:56,980
喝光它  小子

这样我勾引你就不会惹你反感了
It'll make the whole seduction part less repugnant.

127
00:11:03,160 --> 00:11:05,090
我只是开玩笑!
I'm just kidding!

128
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:07,150
来吧
Come on.

129
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:15,090
你有点内向  是吧?
You're kinda closed-mouthed, aren'tyou?

130
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:17,100
对不起
I'm sorry.

131
00:11:17,170 --> 00:11:21,660
那只是...  我的生活很无趣
It's just, you know, my life isn't that interesting.

132
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:25,340
我去上班  我下班回家
I go to work, I come home.

133
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:28,910
我不知道有什么好说的
Don't know what to say.

134
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:30,920
你应看看我的日记
You should read myjournal.

135
00:11:30,980 --> 00:11:35,480
我的意思是  我的生活全是... 空白
I mean, it's just... blank.

136
00:11:35,560 --> 00:11:38,790
真的?  那让你觉得悲哀或忧虑吗?
Really? Does that make you sad oranxious?

137
00:11:38,860 --> 00:11:42,190
我是说  想到没有好好生活我就觉得忧虑
I mean, I'm always anxious thinking I'm not living my life to the fullest,

138
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:44,200
可以利用各种可能性
taking advantage of every possibility,

139
00:11:44,260 --> 00:11:48,200
来确保我没有浪费  我所拥有的每一秒
making sure I'm not wasting one second of the little time I have.

140
00:11:48,270 --> 00:11:50,760
-我想过  -是吗?
I think about that. Yeah?

141
00:11:55,210 --> 00:11:57,140
你真是好人
You're really nice.

142
00:11:57,210 --> 00:12:00,040
上帝  我一直忍不住这样说
Ohh! God, I have to stop saying that.

143
00:12:02,280 --> 00:12:04,250
我想嫁给你
I'm gonna marryyou.

144
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:06,250

约耳  你哪天应陪我去查尔斯河看看
Joel, you should come up to the Charles with me sometime.

147
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:20,170
它在每年二月这时都会结冰
It gets frozen this time ofyear.

有人想吸大麻吗?

275
00:23:48,350 --> 00:23:50,950
罗布  别管那个了
Oh, God, Rob, give it a rest.

276
00:23:51,020 --> 00:23:52,960
上帝啊  她在惩罚我

我不想她看到我这么绝望
I don't want to seem desperate.

283
00:24:06,810 --> 00:24:09,100
约耳  为什么你不把这看着一个信号呢?
Joel, why don't you just see this as a sign,

284
00:24:09,100 --> 00:24:11,400
一个彻底分手的信号
make a clean break. Right?

285
00:24:11,480 --> 00:24:14,610

00:24:58,620 --> 00:24:59,990
克莱门汀·克罗斯基从她的记忆中抹去了约耳

299
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,290
请别再向她提起他们以前的关系

300
00:25:02,300 --> 00:25:04,200
谢谢  空白有限公司

301
00:25:04,200 --> 00:25:08,460

319
00:26:16,840 --> 00:26:18,830
巴瑞斯先生
Mr. Barish?

320
00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:23,140
你今天好吧?

321
00:26:23,210 --> 00:26:25,140

Not too good actually.

322
00:26:25,210 --> 00:26:27,140
天  斯坦!

00:26:33,590 --> 00:26:35,580
-这里  医生  -谢谢
Here, Doctor. Thank you.

326
00:26:36,590 --> 00:26:38,520
你不应该看到这个
You should not have seen this.

327
00:26:38,590 --> 00:26:40,580
真对不起
I apologize.

328
00:26:44,460 --> 00:26:46,900
这是开玩笑  对吗?  这是克莱门汀她...
This is a hoax, right? I mean, this is Clem--

329
00:26:46,970 --> 00:26:49,800
-我向你保证  -不是的
I am sure you. No.

330
00:26:55,210 --> 00:26:57,970
这算什么
There's no such thing as this.

331
00:26:59,480 --> 00:27:02,680
瞧  巴瑞斯先生  客户档案是保密的
Look, our files are confidential, Mr.Barish,

332
00:27:02,750 --> 00:27:05,220
我不能把它们给你看
so I can't show you evidence.

333
00:27:05,280 --> 00:27:11,020
这样说吧  克罗斯基活得很不快乐
Suffice it to say that Miss, Miss Kruczynski was not happy,

334
00:27:11,090 --> 00:27:13,150
她想要新的生活
and she wanted to move on.

335
00:27:13,230 --> 00:27:15,160
我们提供了可行性
We provide that possibility.

336
00:27:15,230 --> 00:27:19,290
克罗斯基活得很不快乐  她想要新的生活
"Miss Kruczynski was not happy and wanted to move on.

337
00:27:19,370 --> 00:27:21,890
我们提供了可行性
We provide that possibility."

338
00:27:21,970 --> 00:27:23,900
那是什么鬼话?
What the hell is that?

339
00:27:23,970 --> 00:27:26,900
我是她遇到过的最好的男人
Nicest guy she everwent out with.

340
00:27:28,970 --> 00:27:31,410
天  罗布!  别敲了!
God, Rob! Give it a rest!

341
00:27:31,480 --> 00:27:33,410
没什么
It's okay. It's all right.

342
00:27:33,480 --> 00:27:36,180
卡丽  我正在作鸟屋
Carrie, I am making a bird house.

343
00:27:38,150 --> 00:27:41,950
我怎么说呢?  约耳  你了解克莱门汀  她就是这样
What can Isay, Joel? You know Clementine. She's like that.

344
00:27:42,020 --> 00:27:43,820
做事冲动
She's impulsive.

345
00:27:43,890 --> 00:27:47,450
她一时兴起就想将你彻底忘记
She decided to erase you almost as a lark.

346
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:53,300
一时兴起?
A lark.

347
00:27:53,370 --> 00:27:56,800
为什么?  为什么?  为什么你要那样做?
Why? Why? Why? Why did you do that?

348
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:02,140
等等  等等!
Wait, wait, wait, wait!

349
00:28:02,210 --> 00:28:05,140
对不起  医生  他硬闯进来
I'm sorry, Doctor. He just barged right in here.

350
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:06,710
-好吧  我想清除我的记忆
Okay. I want it done.

351
00:28:06,710 --> 00:28:08,280
-我告诉他在情人节前我们是最忙的
I told him pre-Valentine's Day is our busy time.

352
00:28:08,280 --> 00:28:11,650
-没事的  玛丽  -但有人还等着
that's okay, Mary. -But there are people waiting.

353
00:28:11,720 --> 00:28:14,650
巴瑞斯先生  如果你愿意进来
Mr. Barish, if you'd like to come inside.

354
00:28:14,720 --> 00:28:18,280
-玛丽  你能送走吴女士吗?  -当然可以
And Mary, if you could take care of Mrs Woo. Yes, of course.

355
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:28,030
我们要你做的头一件事  巴瑞斯先生
the first thing we need you to do, Mr. Barish,

356
00:28:28,100 --> 00:28:30,030
就是回家
is to go home.

357
00:28:30,100 --> 00:28:35,540
寻找所有与克莱门汀有关的事物
and collect everything you own that has some association with Clementine.

358
00:28:35,610 --> 00:28:37,840
所有的
Anything.

359
00:28:39,310 --> 00:28:42,770
我们会用这些事物在你的大脑里
And we'll use these items to...

360
00:28:42,770 --> 00:28:46,220
建立一个与克莱门汀有关的映象
create a map of Clementine in your brain.

361
00:28:46,290 --> 00:28:51,350
所以我们需要相片、衣物、礼品...
So we'll need, photos, clothing, gifts,

362
00:28:51,420 --> 00:28:56,380
像她送给你的书  你们俩一起购买的CD
books she may have bought you CDs, you may have bought together,

363
00:28:56,460 --> 00:28:59,090
日记
journal entries.

364
00:28:59,160 --> 00:29:00,930
我们想清空你的家
We want to empty your home.

365
00:29:01,000 --> 00:29:05,330
我们想从你生命中清除克莱门汀
We want to empty your life of Clementine.

366
00:29:05,400 --> 00:29:07,650
在那个映象被建立后
And after the mapping is done,

367
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:09,900
技术员今晚会到你家作记忆消除术
our technicians will do the erasing in your home tonight.

368
00:29:09,980 --> 00:29:13,310
这样  你第二天清晨醒来时
That way, when you awake in the morning,

369
00:29:13,380 --> 00:29:17,820
你发现自己躺在床上  就像什么也没发生过一样
you'll find yourself in your own bed as if nothing had happened.

370
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:20,370
一个全新的生活等待着你
a new life waiting you.

371
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:26,850
别作白日梦  伙计!
Wake up, buddy!

372
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:33,830
对不起  索贝尔夫人
No, I'm sorry. Mrs.Sobel.

373
00:29:33,900 --> 00:29:37,060
你不能一个月做三次记忆消除术
You can't have the procedure done three times in one month.

374
00:29:38,100 --> 00:29:41,730
这是我们的制度  你好吗  巴瑞斯先生?
Well, it's just not our policy. How are you today, Mr. Barish?

375
00:29:42,840 --> 00:29:45,470
你好  我还在线
Hello. I'm right here.

376
00:29:45,540 --> 00:29:47,640
我知道这很紧急  我们会尽力把你
I know it's an emergency, and we'll do everything we can...

377
00:29:47,640 --> 00:29:49,740
安排到三月份头一个
We can fit you in on the first of March.

378
00:29:49,820 --> 00:29:53,250
也许你该跟医生说说
Maybe you could talk to the doctor, and he--

379
00:29:53,320 --> 00:29:55,450
好吧  我们就这样约定了
All right, so let's make an appointment.

380
00:29:55,450 --> 00:29:57,580
你星期几来?
What day would you like to come in this week?

381
00:29:57,660 --> 00:30:01,090
-巴瑞斯先生  -医生今下午真的很忙
Mr. Barish. he's really busy this afternoon.

382
00:30:01,160 --> 00:30:05,120
也许明天十二点一刻比较好
Maybe tomorrow would be better. Around 12:15? Can you do that?

383
00:30:06,130 --> 00:30:09,070
因为二月有情人节  所以我们忙得够呛
February is very busy for us because of Valentine's Day.

384
00:30:16,010 --> 00:30:18,270
这是斯坦·范恩
This is Stan Fink,

385
00:30:18,340 --> 00:30:20,940
我们最好的技术人员之一
one of ourmost experienced andskilled technicians.

386
00:30:23,020 --> 00:30:25,510
他今晚为你做消除术
He'll be handling your case tonight.

387
00:30:25,580 --> 00:30:28,020
很高兴认识你  巴瑞斯先生
Great to meet you, Mr. Barish.

388
00:30:28,090 --> 00:30:30,020
我叫约耳·巴瑞斯
My name is Joel Barish,

389
00:30:30,090 --> 00:30:34,650
我来这儿消除对克莱门汀·克罗斯基的记忆
and I'm here to erase Clementine Kruczynski.

390
00:30:34,730 --> 00:30:39,750
很好  现在告诉我关于克莱门汀的事
Very good. Now tell me about Clementine.

391
00:30:39,830 --> 00:30:42,360
嗯 我...
Uh, I was...

392
00:30:42,430 --> 00:30:46,230
本来和另一个女人一起生活  她叫内奥米
Living with this woman, Naomi,

393
00:30:46,310 --> 00:30:48,870
几年前
uh, a couple years ago,

394
00:30:48,940 --> 00:30:51,560
我的朋友罗布和卡丽请我们去一个海滩聚会
and my friends Rob and Carrie invited us to this party at the beach.

395
00:30:51,560 --> 00:30:54,170
我不喜欢聚会
I don't like parties.

396
00:30:54,250 --> 00:30:57,480
内奥米不能去  但我去了...
Naomi couldn't go, but I went...

397
00:30:57,550 --> 00:31:00,710
而且遇到了克莱门汀
and I met Clementine.

398
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:03,780
对不起
I 'm sorry.

399
00:31:03,860 --> 00:31:06,790
让我们从你最近的回忆开始
Let's start with your most recent memories...

400
00:31:06,860 --> 00:31:10,450
然后慢慢向以前删除
and work back wards from there, more or less.

401
00:31:10,530 --> 00:31:12,460
我们的每一段记忆中
There's an emotional core...

402
00:31:12,530 --> 00:31:14,470
都会有一个感情核心
to each of our memories,

403
00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:18,300
当这个核心被清除掉时  相应的记忆会缓慢消失
and when you eradicate that core it starts its degradation process.

404
00:31:18,370 --> 00:31:20,800
明早你醒来时
By the time you wake up in the morning,

405
00:31:20,870 --> 00:31:24,600
相应的记忆就会消失无踪
all the memories we've targeted will have withered and disappeared,

406
00:31:24,680 --> 00:31:26,700
就像快醒时做的梦一样
as in a dream upon waking.

407
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:30,080
有损伤大脑的危险吗?
Is there any risk of brain damage?

408
00:31:30,150 --> 00:31:33,140
从技术角度讲
Well, uh, technically speaking,

409
00:31:33,220 --> 00:31:35,150
这过程本身就是对大脑的伤害
the procedure is brain damage,

410
00:31:35,220 --> 00:31:38,050
但只相当于一场宿醉
but it's on a parwith a night of heavy drinking.

411
00:31:38,120 --> 00:31:40,060
你不会有事的
Nothing you'll miss.

412
00:31:42,260 --> 00:31:44,530
舒服吗?
Comfortable?

413
00:31:44,600 --> 00:31:48,230
巴瑞斯先生  我们现在做的是生成你的脑部图
What we're doing here Mr. Barish is actually creating a map of your brain.

414
00:31:48,300 --> 00:31:50,630
好  我们开始吧
Okay, let's getstarted.

415
00:31:50,700 --> 00:31:54,430
如果你想今晚就做的话  我们有些准备工作要做
If we want to get this procedure under way tonight. We have some work to do.

416
00:31:54,510 --> 00:31:58,340
巴瑞斯先生  我要你对这些物体作出反应
I want you to react to these objects Mr. Barish, if you will.

417
00:32:01,010 --> 00:32:03,450
这里面有一个好故事.
There's a good story behind this one.

418
00:32:03,520 --> 00:32:06,450
巴瑞斯先生  我会得到比较准确的情感读数
Actually, Mr. Barish, I'll get a much better emotional readout.

419
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:10,420
如果你只在脑海里描述
If you refrain from any sort of verbal description of the items.

420
00:32:10,490 --> 00:32:12,420
所以把集中精力来回忆
Just try to focus on the memories.

421
00:32:12,490 --> 00:32:15,050
-对不起  -没什么
Oh. Sorry. Okay.

422
00:32:16,830 --> 00:32:21,270
健康活性集中在那儿 健康读数很好
Healthy activity up there again. Healthy readouts Very good.

423
00:32:21,330 --> 00:32:24,600
另一件物体
-Here's another object. -That's so.

424
00:32:24,670 --> 00:32:27,260
下一件
Next item. Okay.

425
00:32:28,840 --> 00:32:30,770
"土豆头"
Potato head.

426
00:32:30,840 --> 00:32:34,110
下一件
-Next item. Okay. -

427
00:32:34,180 --> 00:32:39,050
集中精力去回忆  帕特里克  帮帮我
Just focus on the memories. Patrick, do me a fiavor.

428
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:42,450
-帕特里克  帮帮我好吗?  -好的
Patrick, do me a fiavor, will you? Yeah.

429
00:32:42,520 --> 00:32:46,390
你能检查下稳压器吗?
Can you check the voltage regulator? What do we got there?

430
00:32:46,460 --> 00:32:48,390
-电压看来合适  -真的吗?
-voltage looks fine. Really?

431
00:32:48,460 --> 00:32:52,450
我这里不太清楚
Well, I'm not wiping as clean as I like here.

432
00:32:55,400 --> 00:33:00,530
技术上讲  这个过程就是大脑损伤
Well, technically, the procedure is brain damage.

433
00:33:02,670 --> 00:33:05,070
请检查一下电路连接
Check the connections, please.

434
00:33:06,850 --> 00:33:09,510
你在这里
Oh, there you are.

435
00:33:14,890 --> 00:33:18,950
为什么我...?  我不能理解我所看到的
Why am I? I don't understand what I'm looking at.

436
00:33:19,020 --> 00:33:21,820
为什么我站在这儿而...
Why am I standing here and--

437
00:33:21,890 --> 00:33:24,730
天  幻觉记忆!
Oh, my God. Dejavu.

438
00:33:24,800 --> 00:33:26,890
一切似曾相识!  这太...
Dejavu. This is so--

439
00:33:26,970 --> 00:33:29,900
好  那让我们开始吧  如果我们想今晚就做的话
All right, we should get started. If we're gonna get the procedure.

440
00:33:29,970 --> 00:33:32,900
那我们现在有些准备工作要做
under way tonight, we have some work to do.

441
00:33:32,970 --> 00:33:35,500
我已经进入自己的回忆  对吧?
I'm in my head already, aren't I?

442
00:33:35,570 --> 00:33:38,910
我想是这样的  这是对的
I suppose so. Uh, this is about right.

443
00:33:38,980 --> 00:33:41,970
这就是...  这就是记忆清除看上去的样子
This is what it... This is what it would look like.

444
00:33:44,550 --> 00:33:46,480
很好
Very good.

445
00:33:46,550 --> 00:33:48,820
结束后我们会清除这些物品
We'll dispose of these mementos when we're done here.

446
00:33:48,890 --> 00:33:51,220
以后你就不会因为他们为什么
That way you won't be confused later by their unexplainable presence...

447
00:33:51,290 --> 00:33:54,550
在你家里而困惑了
in your home.

448
00:33:54,630 --> 00:33:56,060
-帕特里克?  -什么?
Patrick? Yeah?

449
00:33:56,130 --> 00:33:58,790
帕特里克  你能检查...  帕特里克?
Patrick, can you check-- Patrick?

450
00:33:58,860 --> 00:34:02,320
-我看到自己声音的读数  -帕特里克?
-I'm getting some sort of readout of my own voice. Patrick? Patrick?

451
00:34:02,400 --> 00:34:06,300
-为什么这么多电线?  -有很多设备
-Why are there so many wires? -A lot of equipment.

452
00:34:06,370 --> 00:34:10,170
-有作用吗?  -你确信你正确安装了这些设备吗?
-Does that help? -Are you sure you set that thing up properly?

453
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:12,180
-好点了吗?  -今天怎么样  巴瑞斯先生?
-How's that? -How are you today, Mr. Barish?

454
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:14,340
-我们在这儿  巴瑞斯先生  -好点了
There we are, Mr. Barish. That's better.

455
00:34:14,410 --> 00:34:17,750
-我不知道自己是否喜欢这样  -我也许该试试这样
-I don't know if I like this. -Think I might try this then.

456
00:34:17,820 --> 00:34:19,720
快完成了
We're almost done now.

457
00:34:19,790 --> 00:34:22,910
日记的价值无法衡量
Journal. That would be invaluable.

458
00:34:22,990 --> 00:34:27,080
我今晚遇到了一个人  我不知该做些什么
"I met someone tonight. I don't know what to do.

459
00:34:27,160 --> 00:34:29,720
她叫克莱门汀  她很漂亮
Her name is Clementine, and she's amazing. "

460
00:34:32,400 --> 00:34:35,330
什么?  小心点!  退回去!
What? What? Come on! Careful! Step back!

461
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,330
放松些!
Just take it easy.

462
00:34:37,400 --> 00:34:39,230
好的
That's fine.

463
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:41,140
不要伤害到他了
Let's not roach the guy.

464
00:34:44,610 --> 00:34:46,670
好的  你调好了
All right, you got that one.

465
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:50,550
-这里像垃圾堆对吧?  -这是公寓房  帕特里克
This place is sort of a dump, don't you think? It's an apartment, Patrick.

466
00:34:50,620 --> 00:34:52,880
帕特里克
Patrick.

467
00:34:52,950 --> 00:34:57,050
那好  不像垃圾堆  但就像一个未赋予灵感的荒原
Well, not a dump then but sorta plain. Uninspired.

468
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:59,560
还有一股霉臭味
And there's sort of a stale smell.

469
00:34:59,620 --> 00:35:04,190
帕特里克 我们能不能不管这些?
Patrick, can we just please get through this?

470
00:35:04,260 --> 00:35:07,890
-我们还要过漫长的一夜 -好的
We got a very long night ahead of us. Come on. Yeah.

471
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:15,400
这是我上次看到你的情景
This is the last time I saw you.

472
00:35:30,590 --> 00:35:32,520
现在是凌晨三点
It's 3:00.

473
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:37,190
我把你的车弄坏了
I kind a sorta wrecked your car.

474
00:35:37,260 --> 00:35:39,200
酒后驾车了吗?
Were you driving drunk?

475
00:35:39,260 --> 00:35:41,530
真是悲惨
It's pathetic.

476
00:35:41,600 --> 00:35:43,830
我是有一点醉
I was a little tipsy.

477
00:35:43,900 --> 00:35:45,840
但别说我悲惨!
Don't call me pathetic.

00:35:47,910 --> 00:35:50,840
-还真他妈不负责任  你可能撞死了人
I t's fucking i rresponsible. Could've killed somebody.

480
00:35:50,910 --> 00:35:53,840
-你也许已经撞死人了  我们该看看新闻?
Maybe you did kill somebody. Should we turn on the news and see?

481
00:35:53,910 --> 00:35:55,560
-也许我该查查看是否有小孩或小动物被撞死?
Should I check the grill to see if there's any children or small animals?

482
00:35:55,560 --> 00:35:57,210
我没有撞死人!
I didn't kill anybody!

483
00:35:57,280 --> 00:36:01,150
那只是个凹痕  约尔  你像个老妇人一样啰嗦
It's just a fucking dent, Joel. You're like an old lady or something.

484
00:36:01,220 --> 00:36:03,650
你像个什么样?
Well, what are you like?

485
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:05,660
-一个酒鬼!  -一个酒鬼?
A wino? A wino?

酒鬼?

488
00:36:10,730 --> 00:36:12,990
老实说吧  约耳
Face it, Joely.

489
00:36:13,060 --> 00:36:17,500
你发火是因为我今晚很晚都没回来
You're freaked out because I was out late without you,

490
00:36:17,570 --> 00:36:20,500
在你的小脑袋里
and in your little wormy brain...

491
00:36:20,570 --> 00:36:24,570
你尽力想发现她是不是和别人做爱了?

我想你和别人做爱了
I assume you fucked someone tonight.

不然别人怎么会喜欢你?

-我只是...  -我不再需要它们了
-I was just... I won't need them any more.

499

有些烦心、生气...  我也不知道自己怎么啦
Angry or annoyed or something, I don't know.

I like Mary. I like when she comes to visit. I just don't think she likes me.

505
00:37:25,600 --> 00:37:28,160
她喜欢你  得了吧
She likes you okay.

506
00:37:28,240 --> 00:37:31,330
所以我也许该把女友叫来  我现在有女友了
Maybe I should invite my girlfriend over. I have a girlfriend now.

克莱  让我送你回家吧
Clem, let me drive you home.

516

从我面前消失掉!  该死!

到明天早上  我就会彻底忘了你!

真是这狗屁爱情的完美结局!

一个女孩被我吸引会有问题吗?  有问题吗?
Is there something wrong with a girl being attracted to me? Is that a problem?

你知不知道这样
Do you have any idea...

552
00:40:36,490 --> 00:40:39,430

克莱  你真的认为你能照顾好小孩?

是你  约耳!  是你不能成什么事
It's you,Joel. It's you who can't commit to anything!

584
00:42:52,200 --> 00:42:55,890
-这被清除了!  -你不知道你有多么幸运我看上了你
It's going! You have no idea how lucky you are I'm interested in you!

585
00:42:55,970 --> 00:42:58,900
也许我们该在这里分手了  约尔!
Maybe I should end this right here, Joel!

586
00:42:58,970 --> 00:43:00,650
-把你和愚蠢的服装珠宝一起甩在跳蚤市场
Leave you at the flea market with this stupid costume jewelry!

587
00:43:00,650 --> 00:43:02,340
-清除了  这段回忆是垃圾
-It's done. This is crap.

588
00:43:02,410 --> 00:43:04,650
-也许你能找把古董摇椅好去死在上面
Maybe you could find yourself an antique rocking chair to die in!

589
00:43:04,650 --> 00:43:06,900
-所有的这些痛苦和迷惑...
-All the pain, confusion...

590
00:43:13,820 --> 00:43:16,510
-你好  帕特里克  -你好  玛丽  还好吗?
-Hi, Patrick. -Hi, Mary. How's it goin'?

591
00:43:16,590 --> 00:43:19,520
-你好  -天真冷
Hey, you. Oh, it's freezing outside.

592
00:43:19,590 --> 00:43:21,420
-我们做得还不错吧?  -是的
Find us okay? Yeah.

593
00:43:24,800 --> 00:43:27,290
-嗯  -真亲热!
Mmm. Hot!

594
00:43:28,500 --> 00:43:30,430
可怜的家伙
Poor guy.

595
00:43:33,300 --> 00:43:35,530
有真正的饮料喝吗?
Don't you have anything real to drink?

596
00:43:35,610 --> 00:43:38,540
我们真的还未检查过
Uh, we haven't really checked yet.

597
00:43:38,610 --> 00:43:40,540
-帕特里克?
Patrick?

598
00:43:40,610 --> 00:43:43,010
让我来吧
Let me do the honors.

599
00:43:44,320 --> 00:43:46,250
玛丽讨厌我
Mary hates me.

600
00:43:46,320 --> 00:43:48,980
我从不讨女人的欢心
Never really had much luck with the ladies.

601
00:43:49,050 --> 00:43:50,990
也许你该停止偷她们的内裤
Maybe if you stop stealing their panties.

602
00:43:51,060 --> 00:43:54,080
斯坦  斯坦
Stan. Stan.

603
00:43:54,160 --> 00:43:55,590
-还有更多事  -别说了!
There's more. No!

604
00:43:55,660 --> 00:43:56,960
-是的  -不!
Yes. No!

605
00:44:01,000 --> 00:44:03,930
你不想要酒吧 帕特里克?
You didn't want any, did you, Patrick?

606
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:06,600
-不要  没什么  -等等
Uh, no, that's okay. Wait.

607
00:44:06,670 --> 00:44:10,970
祝福那些健忘的人吧  因为他们战胜了自己过去的错误
"Blessed are the forgetful for they get the better even of their blunders."

608
00:44:21,820 --> 00:44:25,260
尼采的《超越善恶》
That's Nietzsche. Beyond Good and Evil.

609
00:44:25,320 --> 00:44:27,590
我从"巴特利玆" 中摘来的
I found it in my Bartlett's.

610
00:44:27,660 --> 00:44:29,590
什么是"巴特利玆" ?
What's your Bartlett's?

611
00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:31,560
那是一本语录  帕特里克
It's a quote book, Patrick.

612
00:44:31,630 --> 00:44:33,530
充满各种名言警句
It's a book of quotations.

613
00:44:33,600 --> 00:44:36,090
我想医生有一天也会上"巴特利玆" 的
I think Howard will be in Bartlett's one day.

614
00:44:36,170 --> 00:44:38,100
-肯定  -医生他说的都是名言
Definitely. Howard is pure Bartlett's.

615
00:44:38,170 --> 00:44:40,540
上帝
God!

616
00:44:40,610 --> 00:44:43,170
我们这样会吵醒他吗?
Can you wake him up?

617
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:45,180
不会
You can't wake him up.

618
00:44:54,750 --> 00:44:56,740
你什么都不跟我讲  约耳
You don't tell me things, Joel.

619
00:44:58,290 --> 00:45:00,220
我是一本打开的书
I'm an open book.

620
00:45:01,460 --> 00:45:03,390
我什么都告诉你
I tell you everything.

621
00:45:03,460 --> 00:45:06,690
甚至是每一件丢人的事
Every damn embarrassing thing.

622
00:45:09,300 --> 00:45:11,390
你不信任我
You don't trust me.

623
00:45:11,470 --> 00:45:15,000
不断说话并不是必要的交流方式
Constantly talking isn't necessarily communicating.

624
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:19,430
我没有那样做
I don't do that.

625
00:45:21,910 --> 00:45:23,900
我想了解你更深
I want to knowyou.

626
00:45:27,090 --> 00:45:30,110
我没有不断说话!
I don't constantly talk. Jesus!

627
00:45:31,990 --> 00:45:34,150
你必须把有些事拿出来分享  约耳
People have to share things, Joel.

628
00:45:36,230 --> 00:45:38,320
那才是亲密无间
That's what intimacy is.

629
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:41,330
你那样对我说  真让我生气
I'm really pissed thatyou said that to me.

630
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:43,330
对不起
I'm sorry.

631
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:46,390
只是我的生活很无趣
It just... really just isn't that interesting.

632
00:45:47,610 --> 00:45:50,540
我想看看你一直在写的备忘录
I wanna read some of those journals you're constantly scribbling in.

633
00:45:50,610 --> 00:45:53,770
你在里面写了什么  如果你不再有想法、激情
What do you write in there if you don't have any thoughts or passions

634
00:45:53,850 --> 00:45:55,840
或爱的话?
or love?

635
00:46:02,650 --> 00:46:07,720
2003年11月19日
November 19, 2003.

636
00:46:07,790 --> 00:46:10,450
又在中餐馆进餐
Dinner at Kang's again.

637
00:46:12,860 --> 00:46:15,800
我们像在这餐馆中的可怜伴侣们吗?
Are we like those poor couples...

638
00:46:15,870 --> 00:46:18,600
你为他们感到难过
you feel sorry for in restaurants?

639
00:46:18,670 --> 00:46:21,040
我们都是在进餐的行尸走肉吗?
Are we the dining dead?

640
00:46:21,110 --> 00:46:25,800
我受不了我们那样想别人
I can't stand the idea of us being a couple people think that about.

641
00:46:29,780 --> 00:46:32,220
我喜欢那样
I like that.

642
00:46:33,550 --> 00:46:35,490
鸡肉好吃吗?
How's the chicken?

643
00:46:35,550 --> 00:46:37,540
好吃
Good.

644
00:46:38,990 --> 00:46:41,930
-再来点?  -不要了  谢谢
More? No. No. Thank you.

645
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:47,400
她会喝醉然后变得愚笨
She's gonna be drunk and stupid now.

646
00:46:47,470 --> 00:46:49,900
你能帮个忙
Hey, would you do me a favor...

647
00:46:49,970 --> 00:46:52,940
把你洗澡时留在肥皂上的  脏头发弄干净吗?
and clean the goddamn hair off the soap when you're done in the shower?

648
00:46:53,000 --> 00:46:54,940
-好的  -那有一点...
Yeah. It's really...

649
00:46:55,010 --> 00:46:57,100
-恶心  -恶心
- Gross. - gross.

650
00:46:59,410 --> 00:47:01,900
-那只是...  -讨厌的
-It's just... -Repulsive.

651
00:47:01,980 --> 00:47:03,640
讨厌的
It's repulsive.

652
00:47:09,420 --> 00:47:12,080
帕特里克  我们能不能专心完成这个?
Patrick, can we get through this?

653
00:47:12,160 --> 00:47:13,920
帕特里克
Patrick.

654
00:47:13,990 --> 00:47:15,930
嗨  橘子
Hey, Tangerine.

655
00:47:15,990 --> 00:47:19,120
帕特里克  是你
Oh, Patrick, it's you.

656
00:47:19,200 --> 00:47:21,460
我现在很痛苦
I'm so miserable right now.

657
00:47:21,530 --> 00:47:23,930
-为什么?  出了什么事?  -我不知道
-Why? What's wrong? -I don 't know.

658
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:25,940
-什么?  -我感到非常迷惑
-Excuse me? -I'm so confused!

659
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:27,940
我能帮你找什么书吗  先生?
Can I help you fiind something, sir?

660
00:47:28,010 --> 00:47:31,000
迷惑?  你对什么感到迷惑  一切都好啊
Confused? What are you confused about? Everything's fine.

661
00:47:32,010 --> 00:47:33,940
宝贝  过来
Baby, come here.

662
00:47:34,010 --> 00:47:36,000
你在害怕什么?
Scared of what?

663
00:47:40,080 --> 00:47:43,110
-你爱我吗?  -当然爱
Do you love me? of course I do.

664
00:47:43,190 --> 00:47:45,120
系统的自我帮助区在哪里?
Where's the self-help section?

665
00:47:45,190 --> 00:47:47,660
你认为我丑吗?
Do you think I'm ugly?

666
00:47:47,730 --> 00:47:50,160
不  你很漂亮
No! You're beautiful!

-也许我该过来  -不  不

我不知道  我现在一团糟  帕特里克
I don't know. I'm a mess, Patrick.

669
00:47:55,570 --> 00:47:58,260
让我来吧  我会让你高兴
Well, just let me come over. I'll cheer you up.

670
00:47:58,340 --> 00:48:00,200
好的
Okay.

671
00:48:00,270 --> 00:48:03,470
斯坦  我能离开一会儿吗?  我女友真的不高兴了
Stan, can I leave for a while? My girlfriend's really upset.

672
00:48:03,540 --> 00:48:05,740
我们正在清除这可怜人的记忆中...
We're right in the middle of erasing this poor man's--

673
00:48:05,810 --> 00:48:07,740

Let him go, Stan!

674
00:48:07,810 --> 00:48:10,750
让他走吧  我来帮忙
Let him go. I'll help.

675
00:48:10,820 --> 00:48:12,750
看到了吗?  这能有多难?

676
00:48:12,820 --> 00:48:16,510
-她讨厌我  她想我离开  -那走吧

你看上去像个柑橘

00:48:30,800 --> 00:48:34,260
克莱门氏小柑橘  汁多!

他们称呼自己为

"撞击" 他们是唯一重要的乐队
The Clash--the only band that mattered.

692
00:48:56,330 --> 00:48:58,260
他们的名字是有含义的
They called themselves that for a reason.

693
00:48:58,330 --> 00:49:00,010
-真是惊异啊  不是吗?  -社会正气...

是的  彻底的了不起

695
00:49:01,770 --> 00:49:04,290
我在说医生为这世界所作的...
What Howard gives to the world.

696
00:49:05,300 --> 00:49:07,400
是的
Yeah.

让人们能重新开始
To let people begin again.

这真美丽
It's beautiful.

699

就像看着一个婴儿  如此纯洁、自由和单纯
You look at a baby, and it's so pure and so free and so clean.

700
00:49:18,980 --> 00:49:22,420
成年人的生活真是充满悲哀
And adults are like this mess of sadness...

701
00:49:22,490 --> 00:49:25,280
和恐惧
and phobias.

702
00:49:25,360 --> 00:49:28,420
而医生改变了这一切
Howard just makes it all go away.

703
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:40,290

00:49:42,070 --> 00:49:45,010
-宝贝  怎么啦?  -我不知道  我不知道!
-Baby, what's going on? -I don't know. I don't know!

00:49:45,080 --> 00:49:47,480
我感到迷失、害怕
I'm lost, I'm scared,

706
00:49:47,550 --> 00:49:49,480
我感觉自己好像在消失
I feel like I'm disappearing.

707

-消失?  -我皮肤开始松弛!  我在变老!
-Disappearing? -My skin's coming off!. I'm getting old!

-一切好像都没意义  -没事的  没事的
-Nothing makes any sense, Patrick. It's okay. It's okay.

00:50:14,810 --> 00:50:18,040
不  就现在  我必须得去
No, no. Now. Now. I have to go now.

716
00:50:18,110 --> 00:50:20,540
我现在必须去看结冰的查尔斯河
I have to see the frozen Charles now.

717
00:50:24,120 --> 00:50:26,550
你好  这是约耳家

喂  什么事?
Hello? Yeah, what's up?

722
00:50:43,770 --> 00:50:46,860
我和这老女士有些问题要处理
I got into a little situation with the old lady.

723
00:50:46,940 --> 00:50:49,700
你能一个人处理那里的事吗?  伙计  真抱歉
Can you handle things tonight alone? I'm really sorry, man.

724
00:50:49,770 --> 00:50:52,710
别担心  伙计  一切都在我控制之中
Don't worry about it. I got it under control, man.

725
00:50:52,780 --> 00:50:54,560
-他现在处于自动清除程序之中
He's pretty much on autopilot right now anyway.

726
00:50:54,560 --> 00:50:56,340
-谢谢你  斯坦  我欠你的情
-Thanks, Stan. I owe you big-time.

727

伙计  我得挂了
Dude, I gotta go. I gotta go.

728
00:51:01,020 --> 00:51:03,010
查尔斯河

729
00:51:05,160 --> 00:51:07,150
来吧  查尔斯河

730
00:51:11,760 --> 00:51:16,100
"你和我在查尔斯河上 我想现在就死去 克莱"
"Look! You and me on the Charles River. I could die right now, Clem.

731
00:51:16,170 --> 00:51:20,370
"我真的很快乐 以前从未如此感受 我现在就在..."
I'm just happy. I've never felt that before. I'm just exactly where I want"

732
00:51:22,340 --> 00:51:25,000
-我好兴奋! -我也很兴奋!
-I'm so excited. -I'm excited too!

733
00:51:29,010 --> 00:51:31,880

00:51:40,520 --> 00:51:42,550
是什么?
What is it?

737
00:51:42,630 --> 00:51:45,120
我不知道  打开看看
I don't know. Open it up.

738
00:51:52,670 --> 00:51:54,600
这太棒了!
It's gorgeous!

739
00:51:54,670 --> 00:51:57,610
-你喜欢吗?  -是的  正合我口味
-You like it? -Yeah. It's just my taste. Really.

740
00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:02,040
我还从未和送我喜欢珠宝的人出去约会
I've never gone out with a guy who bought me a piece of jewelry I liked.

741
00:52:02,110 --> 00:52:04,100
谢谢你
Thank you.

742
00:52:11,120 --> 00:52:13,060
-走吧  -好的
-Let's go. -Okay.

743
00:52:13,490 --> 00:52:16,390
-亲爱的约耳  -什么  柑桔?
Joely? Yeah, Tangerine?

744
00:52:18,030 --> 00:52:20,550
我丑吗?
Am I ugly?

745
00:52:20,630 --> 00:52:24,070
当我还是小孩时  我觉得自己很丑
When I was a kid, I thought I was.

746
00:52:24,140 --> 00:52:28,230
真不敢相信我已这么多愁善感了
Can't believe I'm crying already.

747
00:52:28,310 --> 00:52:34,140
有时我认为人们不知道  小孩是多么的孤独
Sometimes I think people don't understand how lonely,it is to be a kid.

748
00:52:34,210 --> 00:52:37,240
就像你感到自己很渺小
Like you don't matter.

749
00:52:37,310 --> 00:52:40,650
所以我八岁时...
So, I'm eight...

750
00:52:40,720 --> 00:52:42,980
我拥有这些玩具
and I have these toys,

751
00:52:43,050 --> 00:52:44,990
这些洋娃娃
these dolls.

752
00:52:45,060 --> 00:52:49,790
我最喜欢一个很丑的女洋娃娃  我叫她克莱门汀
My fiavorite is this ugly girl doll who I call Clementine.

753
00:52:49,860 --> 00:52:51,790
我不停的对她大喊
And I keep yelling at her:

754
00:52:51,860 --> 00:52:56,200
"你不能这么丑!  变漂亮! "
"You can't be ugly! Be pretty!"

755
00:52:56,270 --> 00:52:58,290
这很奇怪
It's weird.

756
00:52:58,370 --> 00:53:01,400
就像如果我可以把她变漂亮
Like ifil can transform her,

757
00:53:01,470 --> 00:53:04,100
那我也会魔术般的变漂亮
I would magically, change too.

758
00:53:08,850 --> 00:53:10,780
你很漂亮!
You're pretty.

759
00:53:10,850 --> 00:53:14,010
亲爱的约耳  永远不要离开我
Joely, don't ever leave me.

760
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:18,110
你很漂亮  很漂亮  很漂亮...
Pretty. Pretty. Pretty. Pretty.

761
00:53:18,190 --> 00:53:22,130
米玆维克医生  求你让我保留这段回忆
Mierzwiak, please let me keep this memory..

762
00:53:22,190 --> 00:53:24,130
就这一段
Just this one.

763
00:53:24,200 --> 00:53:27,130
我不想拖着你  来吧!
I don't wanna hold your hand. Come on.

764
00:53:28,970 --> 00:53:30,900
停下
Stop it!

765
00:53:34,340 --> 00:53:37,000
我想现在就死去  克莱
I could die right now, Clem.

766
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:40,230
我真的很...
I'm just...

767
00:53:42,050 --> 00:53:44,210
高兴
happy.

768
00:53:46,120 --> 00:53:48,780
我从未如此感受
I've never felt that before.

769
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:53,910
我现在就在...
I'm just exactly...

770
00:53:56,160 --> 00:53:58,150
我一直想去的地方
where I wanna be.

771
00:53:59,230 --> 00:54:01,220
克莱?
Clem?

772
00:54:07,440 --> 00:54:09,930
我想停下来!
I wanna call it off.

773
00:54:10,010 --> 00:54:12,000
我得想办法告诉他们
I'll giveyou a sign.

774
00:54:16,350 --> 00:54:18,340
我想停下来!
I wanna call it off!.

775
00:54:20,750 --> 00:54:23,690
你听到了吗?  我无法忍受了!
Can you hear me? I don't want this anymore!

776
00:54:23,750 --> 00:54:26,120
我想停下来!
I wanna call it off!.

777
00:54:26,190 --> 00:54:30,020
"你不是无事可做"
"Whenyou ain't got nothing to do"

778
00:54:30,090 --> 00:54:32,090
"我想我会娶你"
"I think I'll marry.you"

779
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:35,930
有人听到了吗?
Is anybody there?

780
00:54:42,340 --> 00:54:44,830
-克莱门汀!  -约耳!
Clementine? Joel?

781
00:54:44,910 --> 00:54:47,140
-克莱...  -约耳?
Clement-- Joely?

782
00:54:47,210 --> 00:54:49,300
-克莱!  -约耳?
Clem! Joel?

783
00:54:49,380 --> 00:54:52,180
克莱!

784
00:54:52,250 --> 00:54:54,480
-怎么啦?  -我们得离开

785
00:54:54,550 --> 00:54:56,990
-什么? 去哪儿? -我想到阻止这事的办法
-What? Where? -I have an idea of how to stop this.

786
00:54:57,050 --> 00:54:59,390
阻止什么?
Stop what?

787
00:54:59,460 --> 00:55:01,390
-亲爱的约耳  -来吧  克莱

790
00:55:07,460 --> 00:55:09,400
-不要  -好的
-No. -Good.

791
00:55:09,470 --> 00:55:11,830
集中精神  克莱
Concentrate, Clem.

792
00:55:11,900 --> 00:55:14,390
我们得回到医生的办公室去
We gotta get back to the offiice.

796
00:55:22,310 --> 00:55:24,980
噢  看着我  我在那里看上很好
Oh, look at me. Hey, I look good there.

客户的档案是保密的  巴瑞斯先生
Look our files are confiidential, Mr. Barish,

798
00:55:28,820 --> 00:55:30,750
我不能给你看

00:55:30,820 --> 00:55:34,220
这样说吧  克莱门汀女士
Suffiice it to say, that Miss, uh-- Miss Kruczynski...

800
00:55:34,290 --> 00:55:38,160
她觉得很不快乐  她想要新的生活
was not happy and she wanted to move on.

801
00:55:38,230 --> 00:55:42,760
-现在告诉我关于克莱门汀的事  -所有你记得的事
Good. Now, tell me about Clementine. Just tell me everything you remember.

802
00:55:42,830 --> 00:55:45,700
-他是这么说的 -我们那天看到了什么?
That's what he said. Then-- What did we see that day?

-约耳  为什么...  -不  我们不坐火车
Joel, why? -No, I don't want to. Joel, please! We're not going on a train.

806
00:55:53,110 --> 00:55:55,870
-请不要再让我跑了  -快!
Don't make me run anymore. Come on!

807
00:55:55,950 --> 00:55:58,280
米玆维克医生!

00:55:58,350 --> 00:56:01,320
-我们总是得逃吗?  -米玆维克医生!

米玆维克医生!  让我醒来!

813
00:56:20,870 --> 00:56:23,900
对不起  巴瑞斯先生
Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Barish.

814
00:56:23,970 --> 00:56:26,970
我想你知道所有这一切的原因
I thought you understood what was going on here.

815
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:30,210
你不知道  你在消除我对她的记忆
I don't know. You're erasing her from me.

816
00:56:30,280 --> 00:56:33,220
你在消除她
You're erasing me from her--

817
00:56:35,750 --> 00:56:37,690
我不知道
I don't know.

818
00:56:37,760 --> 00:56:41,420
你是做这事的  我知道  我现在躺在自己床上
You've got this thing. I'm in my bed. I know it.

819
00:56:41,490 --> 00:56:43,430
我在我自己的回忆中
I'm in my brain.

820
00:56:43,490 --> 00:56:46,400
我也是你想象的一部分  约耳
I'm part of yourimagination too,Joel.

821
00:56:46,460 --> 00:56:49,090
我不能帮你什么
How can I help you from there?

822
00:56:49,170 --> 00:56:52,660
我也在你的大脑里  我就是你!
Uh, I'm insideyourhead too. I'm you.

823
00:56:52,740 --> 00:56:56,370
抱歉
Sorry..

824
00:56:56,440 --> 00:56:58,500
瞧!  那是谁?
Look. Who's that?

825
00:56:58,580 --> 00:57:00,630
他是我们的员工
Oh, he-he works for us.

826
00:57:00,710 --> 00:57:05,380
他是...帕特里克!
That's, uh, Pa-a-a-a-atrick,

827
00:57:05,450 --> 00:57:08,040
宝贝男孩
baby boy.

828
00:57:08,120 --> 00:57:10,610
他偷了我的身份
He's stealing my identity.

829
00:57:10,690 --> 00:57:13,090
他偷了我的东西
He stole my stuff.

830
00:57:13,160 --> 00:57:16,850
他用我的语言和事物去引诱我的爱人
He's seducing my girlfriend with mywords and my things.

831
00:57:16,930 --> 00:57:20,120
-他还偷了她的内裤
He stole her underwear.

832
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:22,130
他偷了她的内裤
He stole her underwear.

833
00:57:22,200 --> 00:57:25,600
我想现在就死去  克莱
I could die right now, Clem.

834
00:57:25,670 --> 00:57:28,140
我真的很高兴
I'm just happy.

835
00:57:28,210 --> 00:57:32,800
我从未如此感受  我现在就在自己一直想去的地方
I've never felt that before. I'm just exactly where I want to be.

836
00:57:34,340 --> 00:57:36,340
我想回家了
I want to go home.

837
00:57:37,450 --> 00:57:39,380
什么?
Hey. What?

838
00:57:41,820 --> 00:57:45,450
克莱!
Clem!

839
00:57:45,520 --> 00:57:47,510
等等  克莱!
Wait. Clem!

840
00:57:48,590 --> 00:57:50,790
克莱?
Clem?

841
00:57:50,860 --> 00:57:53,330
他们在清除你
They,'re erasingyou.

842
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:55,330
我在这儿!
I'm here!

843
00:57:55,400 --> 00:57:58,060
克莱  集中精神  他们是我雇的
Clem, focus. I hired them, okay?

844
00:57:58,140 --> 00:58:00,070
对不起  我真愚蠢!
I'm so stupid.

845
00:58:00,140 --> 00:58:03,160
宝贝  冷静下来  观赏美景
Sweetie, calm down. Enjoy the scenery.

846
00:58:03,240 --> 00:58:06,570
在我醒来完全忘掉你之前  我得阻止他们
I need it to stop before I wake up and I don't know you anymore.

847
00:58:08,210 --> 00:58:12,440
那好  直接叫他们取消手术
Okay, well, you know, just tell them to cancel it then.

848
00:58:12,520 --> 00:58:15,750
你在说什么?  我做不到  我现在是睡着的
What the hell are you talking about? I can't just cancel it. I'm asleep.

849
00:58:15,820 --> 00:58:17,580
那就把自己叫醒!
Wake yourself up!

850
00:58:17,650 --> 00:58:20,420
那好  你想我自己醒过来  好的
Okay. You want me to wake up? Okay. Great. All right.

851
00:58:20,490 --> 00:58:23,390
来试试看  我这样能不能让你高兴?
Okay, here we go. This make you happy if I try? Yeah.

852
00:58:23,460 --> 00:58:26,490
我尽力试试 开始了  这真是个好主意
I'll try really hard. Here we go. That was a great idea.

853
00:58:28,770 --> 00:58:32,000
这还真是有效
Boy, that's working like gangbusters.

854
00:58:32,070 --> 00:58:34,590
-不要!  那让我很痒!  -我的天
Don't! That tickles me! Oh, my, goodness.

855
00:58:34,670 --> 00:58:37,110
-天  那是什么?  -天 那是...
Oh, my, God. What is that? Jesus Christ! What the--

856
00:58:37,170 --> 00:58:39,110
是个胎记!
It's a birthmark!

857
00:58:42,410 --> 00:58:45,680
这的确有用...但只一会儿
I t did work, for a second,

858
00:58:45,750 --> 00:58:48,270
-但我动不了  -看到了?
-but I couldn't-- I couldn't move. See?

859
00:58:48,350 --> 00:58:53,020
那是另一个约耳预言吗?
Well, isn't that just another one of Joel's self-fulfilling prophecies?

860
00:58:53,090 --> 00:58:55,420
用来证明我的主意是错的
It's more important to prove me wrong than to actually.

861
00:58:55,490 --> 00:58:58,660
我不想谈这个  好吗?
Look, I don't want to discuss this right now, okay?

862
00:58:58,730 --> 00:59:02,060
好的
Fine.

863
00:59:02,130 --> 00:59:05,120
接下来怎么办?  我在听着
Then what? I'm listening.

864
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:07,900
-我也不知道  -你先清除了我
I don't know. You erased me.

865
00:59:07,970 --> 00:59:10,630
所以我才会作这个清除术
That's why I'm here. That's why I'm doing this in the first place.

866
00:59:10,710 --> 00:59:12,640
-对不起  -你真是!
I'm sorry. You-- You!

867
00:59:12,710 --> 00:59:15,140
你了解我  我很冲动
You know me. I'm impulsive.

868
00:59:18,450 --> 00:59:20,540
那就是为什么我爱你
That's what I love aboutyou.

869
00:59:24,320 --> 00:59:25,850
约耳?
Joel?

870
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:28,890
我有另一个解决问题的方法
I have anotheridea forthis problem.

871
00:59:28,960 --> 00:59:31,220
现在我是你的回忆
This is a memory of me, The way...

872
00:59:31,300 --> 00:59:35,990
当你看到我的胯部  你就想和我在沙发上做爱
you wanted to have sex on the couch after you looked down at my crotch.

873
00:59:36,070 --> 00:59:39,000
-什么?  -约耳  那些人会找到这里
What? Joel, the eraser guys are coming here,

874

为什么你不把我带到其它的地方去?

875
00:59:42,140 --> 00:59:44,300
其它没有我的回忆中
somewhere where I don't belong,

876
00:59:44,370 --> 00:59:46,930
我们藏在那里  直到明早
and we hide there till morning?

877

953
01:04:23,090 --> 01:04:25,850
而且我无法找到他

早上醒来时你还会记得我
You'll remember me in the morning,

我想我们可以来点鸡尾酒

他在为你做手术时爱上了你
He fell for you when theywere doing you,

985
01:05:57,950 --> 01:06:00,110
现在他向你介绍自己  好像他从来不认识你
and now he's introduced himself like he doesn't even know you,

986
01:06:00,180 --> 01:06:02,520

她只是过来帮忙
She was just here to help out.

1004
01:06:58,810 --> 01:07:01,970
我想尽力理解整个过程...
I wanted to understand as much as I could about the procedure as possible.

1005
01:07:02,050 --> 01:07:05,740
我想这对我的工作很重要
I think it's important for myjob to understand the innerworkings...

1006
01:07:05,820 --> 01:07:08,010
理解这工作中的细节
of the work that we do.

1007
01:07:08,080 --> 01:07:10,780
这工作不是我做的
Well, not that I do, but the work that is done...

1008
01:07:10,850 --> 01:07:14,550
而是与我共事的人所作的
by people where I also work, the work of my colleagues.

1009
01:07:14,620 --> 01:07:17,650
好了  让我们来看看

-你试过C门了吗?  -当然试过了
Did you try going through the C-gate? Yeah, of course.

我已经使用了检查程序
I already-- I ran the utility programs,

1020
01:07:48,320 --> 01:07:50,320
但并没找到什么
and I had nothing there,

1021
01:07:50,390 --> 01:07:53,390
所以我根据打印日志检查了所有的记忆扫描
so I checked all the memories against the printed logs.

1022
01:07:53,460 --> 01:07:55,450

1026
01:08:04,310 --> 01:08:06,300
看看是怎么回事

1027
01:08:09,810 --> 01:08:12,980
1028

我喜欢在水槽里洗澡
I love being bathed in the sink.

1028

这感觉是多么的安全
Such a feeling ofsecurity.

1029
01:08:18,190 --> 01:08:21,420
我从来没见你这么高兴  约耳宝贝

1030
01:08:21,490 --> 01:08:23,430
在这儿
There it is.

1031
01:08:23,490 --> 01:08:27,830
我不能理解他怎么会跑到映像之外?
I don't understand why it's offthe map like that.

1032
01:08:27,900 --> 01:08:29,960
他到底在那里干什么?
What the heck was he doing there?

1033
01:08:39,540 --> 01:08:41,530
他的眼晴睁开了
His eyes are open.

1034
01:08:43,410 --> 01:08:47,010
-以前睁开过吗?  -没有
-Has this happened before with him?  -No.

1035
01:08:47,080 --> 01:08:50,640
这不太妙
Oh, this is-- this is not good. No.

1036
01:08:50,720 --> 01:08:52,950
我不得不...
I'm gonna have to--

1037
01:08:53,020 --> 01:08:54,960
给他注射这个
I'm gonna have to give him this.

1038

Howard, you should get some sleep. I think I'll be fine now.

1044

Don't call me Antoine.

1048
01:09:54,350 --> 01:09:56,750
-我的名字是娃利  -我知道
My name is Wally. Yes, I know,

1049
01:09:56,820 --> 01:09:59,380
但如果男人的名字叫娃利  哪个女人会爱呢?
but how can a woman love a man with a name like Wally?

1050
01:09:59,460 --> 01:10:01,860
那是什么?
Oh! Oh! What was that?

1051
01:10:01,930 --> 01:10:04,620
天啊  有人从你的屁股后冒出来

我一直告诫自己不要说成了教皇亚历山大
It's just that I told myself I not to say Pope Alexander and

1164
01:17:07,850 --> 01:17:09,840

-这没什么大不了的  -你真是甜心

1174

我想也许这句合你心意

1215
01:21:34,450 --> 01:21:38,390
我没想到你还会来见我
Didn't figureyou'd show yourface around me again.

1216
01:21:38,450 --> 01:21:41,690
我猜你感到羞耻
I guess I thought you were humiliated.

1217
01:21:41,760 --> 01:21:43,730
毕竟你逃跑了
You did run away after all.

1218
01:21:43,790 --> 01:21:46,560
我只是想看看你
I just needed to see you.

1219
01:21:46,630 --> 01:21:48,930
什么?
Yeah?

1220
01:21:49,000 --> 01:21:51,730
我想...
I'd like to,

1221
01:21:51,800 --> 01:21:54,770
带你出去逛逛或干点什么
take you out or something.

1222
01:21:54,840 --> 01:21:57,400
你已结婚了

01:22:01,980 --> 01:22:05,000
瞧 伙计 我现在就告诉你 我的要求很高
Look, man, I'm telling you right off the bat I'm high maintenance,

1226
01:22:05,080 --> 01:22:09,640
我不会做你的情妇
so I'm not gonna tiptoe around your marriage...

1227
01:22:09,720 --> 01:22:12,050
或什么第三者
or whatever it is you've got going there.

1228
01:22:12,120 --> 01:22:15,250
如果你想作我的恋人  就只能是我一个
if you wanna be with me, you're with me.

1229

好的
Okay.

1230
01:22:17,560 --> 01:22:20,460
很多男孩认为我是一个完美的概念
Too many guys think I'm a concept or I complete them,

1231
01:22:20,530 --> 01:22:23,330
我使他们感到完整或真正的活着
or I'm gonna make them alive.

1232
01:22:23,400 --> 01:22:27,030
但我只是一个寻找内心宁静的混乱女孩
But I'm just a fucked-up girl who's looking for my own peace of mind.

1233
01:22:27,100 --> 01:22:31,770
-别把你的想法强加给我  -我很清楚的记得这话
Don't assign meyours. I remember that speech really well.

1234
01:22:31,840 --> 01:22:35,330
-我让你记住我了吧?  -你让全人类都记住你了
I had you pegged didn't I? You had the whole human race pegged.

1235
01:22:35,410 --> 01:22:37,400
也许吧
Hmm. Probably.

1236
01:22:39,580 --> 01:22:41,880
我仍然认为你会回来拯救我的一生
I still thought you were gonna save my life,

1237
01:22:41,950 --> 01:22:43,890
即便我们都忘记了彼此
even after that.

1238
01:22:43,950 --> 01:22:47,350
我知道的
I know.

1239
01:22:49,690 --> 01:22:51,680
一切都会不同的
It would be different...

1240
01:22:52,830 --> 01:22:55,230
如果我们能再有一个机会

1241
01:22:59,200 --> 01:23:01,570
记住我
Remember me.

1242
01:23:01,640 --> 01:23:03,630
尽你的最大努力
Try your best.

1243
01:23:05,980 --> 01:23:07,910
也许我们能够做到
Maybe we can.

1244
01:23:39,170 --> 01:23:42,110
好了  告诉我你还记得些什么
Okay, so just tell me what you remember,

1245
01:23:42,180 --> 01:23:44,770
我们会把它清除掉
and, uh, then we'll take it from there.

1246
01:23:44,850 --> 01:23:47,080
好的
Okay.

1247
01:23:47,150 --> 01:23:50,050
我对你一见钟情
I liked you immediately.

1248
01:23:50,120 --> 01:23:52,610
但你却不解风情
You didn't come on to me at all.

1249
01:23:52,690 --> 01:23:55,680
我喜欢那样
I liked that.

1250
01:23:55,760 --> 01:23:58,730
起初 在你身边我连话都说不出来
I was so tongue-tied aroundyou at fiirst.

1251
01:23:58,790 --> 01:24:01,460
我只是想让你觉得我很聪明
I wantedyou to think I was smart.

1252
01:24:02,660 --> 01:24:05,000
我迫不及待想和你工作
I couldn't wait to come to work.

1253
01:24:05,070 --> 01:24:08,560
我幻想我们结婚...
I had these fantasies of us being married...

1254
01:24:08,640 --> 01:24:12,000
抚养小孩... 只是...
and having kids and... just--

1255
01:24:12,070 --> 01:24:14,770
亲爱的  我不能这么做
Oh, Howie, I can't do this.

1256
01:24:14,840 --> 01:24:17,440
我们都同意这样做是最好的  玛丽
We agreed it's forthe best, Mary..

1257
01:24:17,510 --> 01:24:19,980
是的  我知道
Yeah, I know.

1258
01:24:20,050 --> 01:24:21,980
天啊!
Oh, God.

1259
01:24:22,320 --> 01:24:24,410
-我来拿底部...  -不 不
I 'll take the bottom and you-- No, no, no. Here.

1260
01:24:24,490 --> 01:24:26,420
-我搬得动  -你想我拿那个吗?
I can take that. So you want me to carry that?

1261
01:24:26,490 --> 01:24:28,980
-帮我一把  -亲爱的  你能拿螺旋桨吗?
Help me with that. Can you get the cooler? Honey, the cooler is--

-那很轻 - 让我来搬

01:24:33,730 --> 01:24:35,890
-不要动任何东西  -我可以拿那飞机

1265
01:24:35,960 --> 01:24:38,960
把东西收拾好  关上车门
Put the thing up. Put the gate back up.

1266
01:24:41,200 --> 01:24:43,930
这是我们初遇的那天
This is the day,we met.

1267
01:24:44,010 --> 01:24:47,200
你站在海浪前  我就在远方画着你
You were down by the surf. I could just make you out in the distance.

1268
01:24:47,280 --> 01:24:49,400
我记得就在那时  我被深深吸引住
I remember being drawn to you even then.

1269
01:24:49,480 --> 01:24:53,610
我想 哈 奇怪 我在画别人的背
I thought, "Wow, how odd. I'm drawn to someone's back. "

1270
01:24:55,380 --> 01:24:58,550
那件让我牢牢记住的运动衫
You were in that orange sweatshirt that I would come to know so well.

1271
01:24:58,620 --> 01:25:00,590
充满爱恨交织
and even hate, eventually.

1272
01:25:00,660 --> 01:25:04,650
当时我想  太酷了  橙黄色的运动衫
At the time I thought, " How cool! An orange sweatshirt."

我刚才看见你
I saw you sitting over here...

1275

独自坐在这儿
by yourself,

1276
01:25:14,540 --> 01:25:17,440
于是我想  感谢上帝
and I thought, "Thank God.

1277
01:25:17,510 --> 01:25:20,300
原来还有不会玩这些东西的正常人
Someone normal who doesn't know how to interact at these things either."

1278
01:25:20,380 --> 01:25:22,500
是啊

1279
01:25:22,580 --> 01:25:25,600

I don't ever know what to say.

你就直接拿了
And then you just took it...

1283
01:25:34,020 --> 01:25:36,550
连我的回答都不等
without waiting for an answer.

1284
01:25:40,100 --> 01:25:42,590
如此亲密
It was so intimate,

01:26:58,110 --> 01:27:01,470
-男的女的?  -什么?
Male or female? What?

1304
01:27:01,540 --> 01:27:03,980
女的...女的
Female. Female.

1305
01:27:06,110 --> 01:27:09,610
那至少我没选错人
At least I'm not barking up the wrong tree.

1306
01:27:12,390 --> 01:27:16,380
-你认识这些人?  -当然不认识  来吧
You know these people? No, of course not. Come on.

1307
01:27:17,390 --> 01:27:19,330
他们可能养了狗
They might have a dog.

1308
01:27:19,390 --> 01:27:23,060
没有狗
There's no dog.

1309
01:27:23,130 --> 01:27:25,120
你在干什么?
What Are you doing?

1310
01:27:25,200 --> 01:27:28,470
-外面很冷  -我不敢相信
It's freezing out. I can't believe this.

1311
01:27:31,570 --> 01:27:35,410
克莱门汀!

1312
01:27:42,150 --> 01:27:44,740
进来吧 不会有事的
Come on, man. The water's fine.

1313
01:27:44,820 --> 01:27:47,950
今晚没人会来这儿 相信我
Nobody's coming here tonight. Believe me.

1314
01:27:50,690 --> 01:27:52,630
真黑
It's dark.

1315
01:27:52,690 --> 01:27:56,690
你女朋友叫什么名字?
So, what's your girlfriend's name?

1316
01:27:56,770 --> 01:28:00,000
内奥米 但我们真的没有...
Naomi, but we're not really-- I mean--

1317
01:28:00,070 --> 01:28:02,470
我们...
We're-- Whatever.

1318
01:28:02,540 --> 01:28:06,630
这里真好  现在我去找蜡烛  火柴
So this is great. Now I can look for, candles, matches...

1319
01:28:06,710 --> 01:28:09,180
和酒柜
and the liquor cabinet.

1320
01:28:09,240 --> 01:28:12,510
天!
Oh, God.

1321
01:28:17,090 --> 01:28:18,950
我想我们该走了
I think we should go.

1322
01:28:19,020 --> 01:28:21,620
-电话不通  -什么?
There's no phone line. What?

1323
01:28:21,690 --> 01:28:23,850
-我们该走了  -为什么?
I think we should go. Why?

1324

今晚这就是我们的房子
It's our house... just for tonight.

1325
01:28:26,600 --> 01:28:29,560
我们是"大卫和鲁思·拉什金"
We are "David and Ruth Laskin."

1326
01:28:30,700 --> 01:28:33,130
你想当谁?
Which one do you want to be?

1327
01:28:33,200 --> 01:28:36,690
我想当鲁思  但我当其他的也行
I prefer to be Ruth, but I can be flexible.

1328
01:28:38,210 --> 01:28:41,540
拜托...
What Are you do--

1329
01:28:41,610 --> 01:28:43,840
-美酒!  -天
Alcohol! Oh, boy.

1330
01:28:43,910 --> 01:28:46,510
你喝酒吗?
So, Are you okay with wine?

1331
01:28:46,580 --> 01:28:49,240
-我不知道  -你来选酒
I don't know. Well, you choose the wine.

1332
01:28:49,320 --> 01:28:53,550
我去找卧室  去找更多鲁思的东西
I'm gonna go find the bedroom and slip into something more... Ruth.

1333
01:28:56,960 --> 01:28:59,720
-我此时很凶残  -我真的该走了
I'm Ruth-less at the moment. I really should go.

1334
01:29:01,460 --> 01:29:04,590
我得赶去坐车
I've gotta catch my ride.

1335
01:29:06,440 --> 01:29:08,930
那走吧!
So go.

1336
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:11,100
我走了
I did.

1337
01:29:11,170 --> 01:29:14,040
我想你也许是个疯子
I thought maybe you were a nut,

1338
01:29:14,110 --> 01:29:16,910
但你只是兴奋
but you were exciting.

1339
01:29:18,010 --> 01:29:19,950
我希望你留下
I wish you'd stayed.

1340
01:29:20,020 --> 01:29:22,710
我也希望我留下  现在我希望我留下
I wish I'd stayed too. Now I wish I'd stayed.

1341
01:29:22,780 --> 01:29:25,840
我希望自己做过很多事
I wish I'd done a lot of things.

1342
01:29:25,920 --> 01:29:28,250
上帝  我希望......
Oh, God, I wish I had--

1343
01:29:32,230 --> 01:29:35,360
我真的希望我能留下
I wish I'd stayed. I do.

1344
01:29:35,430 --> 01:29:37,710
-当我下楼来时  你已经走了
Well, I came back down stairs and youwere gone.

1345
01:29:37,710 --> 01:29:39,990
-我出去了  我从门口出去了
-I walked out. I walked out the door.

1346
01:29:40,070 --> 01:29:42,900
-为什么?  -我不知道  我像个吓坏的小孩一样
Why? I don't know. I felt like a scared little kid.

1347
01:29:42,970 --> 01:29:46,300
我就像...  我想不出来  我不知道
I was like-- It was above my head. I don't know.

1348
01:29:46,380 --> 01:29:48,310
你吓坏了?
You were scared?

1349
01:29:48,380 --> 01:29:50,310
是的
Yeah.

1350
01:29:51,350 --> 01:29:53,970
我想你了解我那一点
Thought you knew that about me.

1351
01:29:54,050 --> 01:29:58,040
我想我跑到篝火那里  逃避我的羞辱
I ran back to the bonfiire trying to outrun my humiliation, I think.

1352
01:29:58,120 --> 01:30:01,750
-是我说错了什么吗?  -是的
Was it something I said? Yeah.

1353
01:30:04,530 --> 01:30:06,930
你说 "那走吧"
You said, "So go"...

1354
01:30:07,000 --> 01:30:09,460
用那样轻蔑的口气  你知道吗?
with such disdain, you know?

1355
01:30:09,530 --> 01:30:12,160
-对不起  -没什么
Oh, I'm sorry. It's okay.

1356
01:30:17,740 --> 01:30:19,670
亲爱的约耳
Joely?

1357
01:30:19,740 --> 01:30:22,610
如果你这次留下来会怎么样?
What if you stayed this time?

1358
01:30:25,280 --> 01:30:27,910
我已走出了门
I walked out the door.

1359
01:30:27,980 --> 01:30:29,920
没有记忆留下了
There's no memory left.

1360
01:30:29,990 --> 01:30:33,110
那至少回来告别
Come back and make up a good-bye, at least.

1361
01:30:33,190 --> 01:30:35,120
假装至少我们告别过
Let's pretend we had one.

1362
01:30:46,230 --> 01:30:48,730
别了 约耳
Bye, Joel.

1363
01:30:48,800 --> 01:30:50,740
我爱你
I love you.

1364
01:30:50,810 --> 01:30:55,070
到蒙太克来找我
Meet me in Montauk.

1365
01:30:58,750 --> 01:31:02,950
飞机坠毁了  不是我让它坠毁的
I didn't crash the plane. The plane crashed. I didn't crash the plane.

1366
01:31:03,020 --> 01:31:07,110
是你用遥控器把飞机坠毁的
You were operating the plane with the remote control and then it crashed.

1367
01:31:07,190 --> 01:31:09,520
风太大了
It was fucking windy. Come on, man.

1368
01:31:09,590 --> 01:31:11,560
你晕晕的还硬要开车
You're stoned, and you're driving.

1369
01:31:11,630 --> 01:31:14,190
是的  白粉使我平衡  白粉使我兴奋
Yeah, the pot balances it out. The pot brings you back up.

1370
01:31:14,260 --> 01:31:16,790
所以我想喝酒时就会去吸它
That's why I smoke it. If I'm going to be drinking then I'll smoke it.

1371
01:31:16,870 --> 01:31:20,490
的确有效  在科学网络上
It does. That's a medical fiact.

1372
01:31:20,570 --> 01:31:23,000
这是被医学证实了的
It was proven on the Science Network.

1373
01:31:23,070 --> 01:31:25,510
-宝贝  看好路  -我什么也看不见
Honey, just watch the road. I can't see shit.

1374
01:31:28,080 --> 01:31:31,070
我看见你和一个漂亮的女性谈话
I saw you talking to somebody pretty.

1375
01:31:31,150 --> 01:31:33,980
-她人很好  -是的  那是谁?
She was nice. Yeah, man. Who was that?

1376
01:31:36,080 --> 01:31:39,380
她只是...一个女孩
She was, um, just a girl.

1377
01:31:46,900 --> 01:31:49,760
完了
Okay.

1378
01:32:25,270 --> 01:32:28,030
那我把卡车开回去
So I gotta-- I gotta drop the van off.

1379
01:32:28,100 --> 01:32:30,200
谢谢  斯坦  谢谢
Thanks, Stan. Thanks.

1380
01:32:30,270 --> 01:32:33,610

We'll talk.

1381
01:33:58,090 --> 01:34:00,820
-你拿走了很多你的东西  -是的  我的东西
You got a lot of your stuff there, I see. Yeah, that's right. My stuff.

1382
01:34:00,900 --> 01:34:04,330
我知道你不会再回来  要是我也会这么做
I take ityou're not coming back. I wouldn't come back if l was you either.

1383
01:34:04,400 --> 01:34:08,130
-你敢发誓你不知道么?  -我发誓
Do you swearyou didn't know? I swear.

1384
01:34:08,200 --> 01:34:11,800
-是你给我做的记忆清除吗?  -不是  上帝作证
So you didn't do the erasing? Of course not. God, no.

1385
01:34:11,870 --> 01:34:14,070
难道你没怀疑过我和他曾是一对?
And you never even suspected we were together?

1386
01:34:14,140 --> 01:34:18,370
也许有一次
Once, maybe.

1387
01:34:18,450 --> 01:34:21,440
我工作回来  你在车里
I was coming back from a job and you were at his car.

1388
01:34:21,520 --> 01:34:24,110
我看见你俩在交谈
I saw you two talking.

1389
01:34:24,190 --> 01:34:27,920
我向你招手  你冲我笑
So I waved to you, and you giggled, you know.

1390
01:34:27,990 --> 01:34:30,290
我看上去怎样?
How'd I look?

1391
01:34:31,730 --> 01:34:33,660
看上去很高兴
You looked happy.

1392
01:34:33,730 --> 01:34:35,990
高兴有着自己的秘密
Happy with a secret.

1393
01:34:37,400 --> 01:34:39,330
以后呢?
And after that?

1394
01:34:39,400 --> 01:34:42,560
我再也没有看见你俩像那样了  所以我想
I never saw you two together again like that, so I just--

1395
01:34:42,640 --> 01:34:46,330
那也许只是自己的想象
I don't know. I just figured I was imagining things.

1396
01:35:11,130 --> 01:35:13,620
我真的喜欢你 玛丽·斯皮尔
I really like you, Mary Svevo.

01:36:20,000 --> 01:36:22,560
你在哪儿  克莱?
Where Are you, Clem? I'm worried.

1401
01:36:22,640 --> 01:36:27,010
我感觉你对我火气很大  我不知道自己做了什么
I feel like you're madat me and I don't know what I did.

1402
01:36:27,080 --> 01:36:29,840

我一生中过得最棒的一夜是
I had the best fucking night of my entire fucking life...

1411
01:37:05,950 --> 01:37:07,880
昨晚
Last night.

1412
01:37:07,950 --> 01:37:09,940
很好
That's better.

1413
01:37:13,050 --> 01:37:17,250
-这真怪  -致所有霍华德医生的病人们
This is weird. To all patients of Dr. Howard Mierzwiak.

我叫玛丽·斯皮尔 你们见过我 但你们已不记得我了
My name is Mary Svevo. We've met, but you don't remember me.

1415
01:37:20,900 --> 01:37:25,330
我为一间你们雇来消除  你们部分回忆的公司工作
I worked for a company you hired to have part of your memory erased."

1416
01:37:25,400 --> 01:37:27,930
当我发现这很可怕后
I have since decided that this is a horrible.

1417
01:37:28,000 --> 01:37:32,560
为了补偿  我把档案寄还给每一个人
In order to correct this, I'm sending everyone's fiile back to them.

1418
01:37:32,640 --> 01:37:36,240
我是克莱门汀·克罗斯基
My name is Clementine Kruczynski.

1419
01:37:36,310 --> 01:37:39,040
我来清除对约耳·巴瑞斯的回忆
I'm here to erase Joel Barish.

1420
01:37:39,110 --> 01:37:41,340
-这是什么?  -我不知道
What is this? I don't know.

1421
01:37:41,420 --> 01:37:46,010
他很无聊... 这理由足够清除对他的回忆吗?
He's boring. Is that enough reason to erase someone?

1422
01:37:46,090 --> 01:37:49,780
我最近在想  以前的我和现在的我差异太大
I've been thinking lately, how I was before and how I am now,

1423
01:37:49,860 --> 01:37:51,790
他改变了我
and it's like he changed me.

1424
01:37:51,860 --> 01:37:53,740
现在我总是很生气
I feel like I'm alway's pissy, now.

1425
01:37:53,740 --> 01:37:55,630
和他在一起时  我不再像是我自己
I don't like myself when I'm with him. I don't like myself anymore.

1426
01:37:55,700 --> 01:38:00,290
我甚至不能忍受看见他  那悲惨  懦弱的笑容
I can't stand to even look at him. That pathetic wimpy apologetic smile.

1427
01:38:00,370 --> 01:38:01,970
-那真是个令人讨厌的家伙 知道吗?
-That sort of wounded puppy shit he does, you know?

1428
01:38:01,970 --> 01:38:03,570
-你在干什么?
-What are you doing?

1429
01:38:03,570 --> 01:38:04,850
-我什么也没干
I 'm not doing anything.

1430
01:38:04,850 --> 01:38:06,140
-我和他之间的爱情玫瑰已凋谢了
-The bloom is certainly fucking off i the rose at this point.

1431
01:38:06,140 --> 01:38:09,130
-你在耍我吗?  -没有!
-Are you screwing with me? -No!

1432
01:38:09,210 --> 01:38:11,640
-你在耍我!  -约耳  我没有
-You are screwing with me. -Joel, I'm not!

1433
01:38:11,710 --> 01:38:16,080

-You clearly are. -Look, let's just take a minute and--

Patrick, get the fuck away.

1435
01:38:46,750 --> 01:38:49,150
-甜心...  -他妈的滚!

1436
01:38:49,220 --> 01:38:52,450
-我们能谈谈吗?  -不  滚!
Can we talk about it? No! Get the fuck away!

1437
01:39:24,720 --> 01:39:26,980

Joel Barish.

1438
01:39:27,060 --> 01:39:29,820
你好  克莱门汀
Hey, Clementine. Hey.

1439

见到你真好
Nice to see you. Yeah.

1440
01:39:36,130 --> 01:39:38,120
真的没受过多少教育
Really, very. educated.

1441
01:39:38,200 --> 01:39:41,640
我的意思是  她很聪明  但没受过多少教育
I mean, she's smart, I think, but not educated.

1442
01:39:41,700 --> 01:39:44,600
我没办法和她谈论书籍  你知道吗?
I couldn't really talk to her about books, you know?

1443
01:39:44,670 --> 01:39:48,110
她只是个喜欢看杂志的女孩
She's more of a magazi ne-reading girl.

她的用词发音很差

对不起冲你大喊大叫

真实的克莱门汀在哪里?
Where's the real Clementine?

01:40:50,170 --> 01:40:53,300
她发型能有什么狗屁意义?  简直是扯蛋!
I mean the whole thing with the hair-- it's all bullshit.

昨晚我们在一起时  我看得很清楚

对不起  我以为威士忌还有很多

克莱认为让人们喜欢她的唯一方法就是

1474
01:41:25,770 --> 01:41:28,610
和他们性交

01:41:28,680 --> 01:41:32,910
或至少可能在他们面前进行性交

她是如此的绝望和没有安全感

1477
01:41:35,980 --> 01:41:40,820
迟早她会和所有人性交

-我不是那样  -我不会那样想你

-因为我不是  -我知道

经过了这么长的时间
What a loss to spend that much time with someone,

1486

才发现她是最熟悉的陌生人

等等!
Wait.

1491
01:42:50,360 --> 01:42:53,050
-好的  -真的?
Okay. Really?

1492
01:42:53,130 --> 01:42:55,190
我不是一个完美的概念  约耳
I'm not a concept, Joel.

1493
01:42:55,190 --> 01:42:57,260
我只是一个寻找内心宁静的混乱女孩
I'm just a fucked-up girl who's looking for my own peace of i mind.

-我并不完美  -我找不到不去爱你的理由
-I'm not perfect. -I can't see anything that I don't like about you.

而我会对你感到厌倦  觉得拘束
and I'll get bored with you and feel trapped...

1498
01:43:07,810 --> 01:43:09,870
因为这以前就发生过
because that's what happens with me.
