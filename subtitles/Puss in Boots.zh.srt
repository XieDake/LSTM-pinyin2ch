00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:45,370
我注定要成为亡命之徒  还是英雄?
Was I destined to be an outlaw... or a hero?

11
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:47,830
我不得而知
I did not know.

12
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,960
我只能确定一件事
Only one thing was certain.

13
00:00:50,130 --> 00:00:53,590

真是没天理了  我到底犯了什么法
This is outrageous! What am I charged with, anyway?

20
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:13,320
你们肯定捉错猫咪了

熔火之心红宝石 不见了
The Heart of Fire ruby is missing.

28
00:01:37,510 --> 00:01:40,260
它是我王冠上的宝石
It is the crown jewel of my kingdom.

29
00:01:40,430 --> 00:01:44,810
现在王冠上只剩下个洞了
Now there is only a hole where the Heart once was.

30
00:01:44,980 --> 00:01:49,020
我想雇你把宝石找回来给我
I want to hire you to find the Heart and bring it back to me.

宝石是被那个臭名昭著的法兰西盗贼偷的
The Heart was stolen by the notorious French thief,

37
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,790
-Le Chuchoteur  -啥

38
00:02:07,080 --> 00:02:09,790
Chuchoteur指喜欢窃窃私语的人

39
00:02:10,420 --> 00:02:14,050
Le Chuchoteur  耳语大盗
Le Chuchoteur. The Whisperer.

40
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:16,010
我们为啥要耳语
Why are we whispering?

41
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:18,760
那是他的名字
That is his name!

42

我们捉获了他的三个跟班
we captured three of The Whisperer's henchmen.

49

只有他们才知道他的秘密巢穴在哪
They are the only ones who know the location of his secret hideout,

50
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:45,410
但他们守口如瓶
but they will not talk.

51
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:48,250
我是专业开瓶器啊
I will make them talk.

他们是我们遇到过的最穷凶极恶的佣兵

58
00:03:25,740 --> 00:03:27,080
开门
Open up!

59
00:03:36,170 --> 00:03:39,840

这些家伙
These guys?

61
00:03:49,470 --> 00:03:51,750
先生  要是这三个魔头帮你

00:03:51,750 --> 00:03:54,020
找到了耳语大盗的秘密巢穴

公主  您的宝石如探囊取物了

66
00:04:07,870 --> 00:04:11,290
你们给猫叔我指出耳语大盗住在哪里
You show Uncle Pusswhere The Whisperer lives.

67
00:04:11,460 --> 00:04:14,670
稍后  我们就去吃炸鱼排
Later, we will all go out for fish sticks!

68
00:04:20,550 --> 00:04:22,210
我知道你想玩儿  但是
I know you want to play, but...

69
00:04:22,380 --> 00:04:23,930

祈求上帝保佑吧  魔头们

有没有搞错
Why did you do that?

78
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:07,860
你们别想吃炸鱼排了
No fish sticks for you!

79
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:13,580
天一亮  你们就会重归牢狱  永无天日

80
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:21,460
想想你们的妈妈  她会多么失望

00:06:29,970 --> 00:06:33,430
我早该想到  你们是孤儿
I should have known. You are orphans.

83
00:06:34,930 --> 00:06:37,980
小家伙们  其实我也是
Well, little ones, so am I.

84
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:42,640
身边没有可信之人
I know it's hard to grow up

85
00:06:42,640 --> 00:06:43,980
成长很艰难
when you don't know who to trust.

86
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:45,780
相信我
Believe me.

87
00:06:45,940 --> 00:06:49,900
我曾被最好的朋友背叛
I was betrayed by my very best friend.

88
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:51,360
他是个蛋
He was an egg.

89
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:56,370
他把我引上歧途
He led me down the wrong path...

90
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:58,870
就像耳语大盗对你们做的一样
...just as this Whisperer has done to you.

91
00:07:02,710 --> 00:07:04,250
小家伙们  你们需要的
What you need, pequenos,

92
00:07:04,420 --> 00:07:07,880
是有人给你们指引正确的方向

我将称你为珍珠  独一无二的珍宝
And I shall call you Perla, because you are one of a kind.

95
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:20,980
而你  叫战
And you, Gonzalo,

96
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:23,060
因为你争强好胜的性格
for your scrappy temper.

97
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:25,440
而你就叫
And you will be...

98
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:29,860
蒂莫泰奥·蒙特纳哥三世爵士
...Sir Timoteo Montenegro the Third.

99
00:07:30,030 --> 00:07:33,820
有时候  你只需要一个头衔
Because sometimes a title is all you need.

100
00:07:35,200 --> 00:07:39,910
现在集合  你们有很多要学的  
Now gather around, for you have much to learn from...

101
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:44,170
靴猫剑术
...Puss In Boots.

102
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,860
从那以后  藤蔓长啊长啊
And after that, the vine grew and grew,

103
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:17,410
直上云霄  一直到达巨人之地
straight up into the clouds... to the Land of Giants.

104
00:08:21,580 --> 00:08:25,120
今晚的故事就是这样了  我的小家伙们
And that is all for tonight, my pequenos.

你们会为背叛我付出巨大代价
You will pay dearly for betraying me,

116
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:35,900
你们这些不听话的猫咪

117
00:09:35,900 --> 00:09:37,490
