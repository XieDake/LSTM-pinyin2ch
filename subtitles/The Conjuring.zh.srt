4
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:26,512
一想起來就嚇人
It scares us just thinking about it.

5
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:28,751
你們會覺得我們瘋了的
When you hear it, you're gonna think we're insane.

6
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,600
說來聽聽，從頭開始
Try us. Please, from the start.

7
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:38,875
一開始沒什麼，只是手腳在不同位置而已
It started out small,like a hand or a leg was in a different position.

8
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:41,555
然後它的腦袋變成了向上，而不是向下
Then its head was looking up instead of down.

9
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:44,758
然後有一天，它突然出現在另一個房間
And then one day, it was in a completely different room.

10
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,479
它會自己挪地方
It was moving around by itself.

11
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,793
是不是有人有你公寓的鑰匙，跟你惡作劇？
Ever think maybe somebody had a key to your apartment and was playing a trick on you?

12
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:52,633
我們也這麼想過
That's exactly what we thought.

13
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:56,542
但沒有發現任何有人進來過的痕跡
But never once did we find any sign or evidence of intrusion.
(安娜貝爾事件 - 1968年)

14
00:00:56,780 --> 00:00:59,037
所以你們認為這個娃娃是被附身了？
And this all led you to believe that the doll was possessed?

15
00:00:59,154 --> 00:00:59,729
是的
Yes.

16
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:04,150
卡米拉聯繫過一位靈媒，她說有個名叫安娜貝爾·希金斯…
Camilla got in touch with a medium.We learned from her that a 7-year-old girl...

17
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,233
…的7歲小女孩曾經死在這個公寓裏
...named Annabelle Higgins had died in this apartment.

18
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:11,110
她很孤獨並且很喜歡我的娃娃
She was lonely and took a liking to my doll.

19
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:13,632
她只想要交朋友
All she wanted was to be friends.

20
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:16,156
我們知道這些後覺得她很可憐
When we heard this,we felt really sorry for her.

21
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:19,000
我們是護士，幫助人是我們的職責
I mean, we're nurses, we help people.

22
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,476
然後…
So...

23
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:24,115
…我們允許她進入了那個娃娃
...we gave her permission to move into the doll.

24
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:26,272
等等，你們做了什麼？
Wait, you did what?

25
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:29,070
她想附身在娃娃裏跟我們一起生活
She wanted to live with us by inhabiting the doll.

26
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:30,435
我們同意了
We said yes.

27
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:32,990
然後情況越來越糟
But then things got worse.

Subtitles downloaded from Podnapisi.NET

29
00:01:40,072 --> 00:01:41,443
(想我嗎？)

30
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,360
上帝啊
God.

31
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:54,352
我們回家的時候，她坐在走廊上
When we came home,she was sitting in the hallway.

32
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,955
但我們走的時候是把她放在空房間裏的
But we had left her in the spare room.

33
00:02:34,880 --> 00:02:36,951
黛比！黛比，等我！
Debbie! Debbie, wait!

34
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:53,757
我們嚇壞了
We are beyond terrified.

35
00:03:53,960 --> 00:03:57,920
不知道怎麼回事、該怎麼做，可以幫幫我們嗎？
We don't know what's going on or what to do. Can you help us?

36
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:00,514
可以
Yes, we can.

37
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:05,000
首先，安娜貝爾並不存在，從來沒有
Now, firstly, there's no such thing as Annabelle, and there never was.

38
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:07,231
鬼魂沒有如此強大的力量
Ghosts don't possess such power.

39
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:10,040
我認為我們面對的是某種非常有心計
I think what we have here is something extremely manipulative.

40
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:12,157
某種兇殘的東西
It's something inhuman.

41
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:14,831
你們對這娃娃的認識是非常錯誤的
It was a big mistake acknowledging this doll.

42
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,151
這樣看來，是這個惡靈算計了你們
And through that,the inhuman spirit tricked you.

43
00:04:17,360 --> 00:04:20,080
你們給了它侵擾你們生命的許可
You gave it permission to infest your lives.

44
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:22,478
什麼是惡靈？
What's an inhuman spirit?

45
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:26,517
某種從未以人類形態出現過的
It's something that's never walked the earth in human form.

46
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:28,798
邪惡的東西
It's something demonic.

47
00:04:32,640 --> 00:04:34,757
所以娃娃並沒有被附身？
So the doll was never possessed?

48
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:36,838
不，不，這只是它的載體
No, no, it was used as a conduit.

49
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:39,350
它自己挪動位置，讓人覺得是被附身了
It was moved around to give the impression of possession.

50
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,196
惡靈不會附身於物品，它們只會附身於人類
Demonic spirits don't possess things,they possess people.

51
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:46,431
它想佔有你們的身體
It wanted to get inside of you.

52
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:59,191
很好，德魯，可以關掉了
All right, that's good, Drew.You can shut it down now.

53
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,030
開燈
Hit the lights.

54
00:05:05,040 --> 00:05:07,157
所以我們讓教堂派了一位牧師過去
So we got the church to send a priest over...

55
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:09,391
給那房子以及住客進行了一次賜福
...to perform a blessing on the house and the occupants.

56
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:13,236
困擾那公寓的東西已經沒有了，還有什麼問題嗎？
Whatever was oppressing that apartment was no longer with them. Any questions?

57
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:16,396
你
Yes.

58
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:18,199
那娃娃現在在哪？
Where's the doll now?

59
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:20,113
某個安全的地方
Someplace safe.

60
00:05:21,480 --> 00:05:23,551
你  - 你們什麼人？
Yep.  - So, what are you guys?

61
00:05:23,760 --> 00:05:25,558
我是說，別人怎麼稱呼你們？
I mean, what do people call you?

62
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,480
嗯，好吧，有人稱呼我們為「神鬼學家」
Uh, well, we've been called Demonologists.That's one name for us.

63
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,353
「獵魔人」，「靈異研究者」
Ghost hunters, paranormal researchers.

64
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:35,836
「怪人」
Kooks.

65
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,434
「瘋子」
Wackos.

66
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,753
但我們更想被叫做「艾德和羅琳·沃倫」
But we prefer to be known simply as Ed and Lorraine Warren.

67
00:05:45,693 --> 00:05:49,588
1960年起，艾德和羅琳·沃倫被認為是世上最著名的靈異現象調查者

68
00:05:49,863 --> 00:05:53,713
羅琳擁有陰陽眼，艾德是天主教會唯一認可的神鬼學家

69
00:05:53,746 --> 00:05:56,484
他們飽受爭議的事業中經歷了無數事件

70
00:05:56,931 --> 00:06:00,255
唯有一件極度邪惡的事件，直到現在才為人所知

71
00:06:00,410 --> 00:06:04,014
基於真實故事改編

72
00:06:08,897 --> 00:06:14,972
《招魂》

73
00:06:30,511 --> 00:06:34,552
1971年，哈瑞斯維爾，羅德島

74
00:06:42,320 --> 00:06:43,834
我們到了
Here we are.

75
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:49,437
哇噢，聽到了嗎？
Wow, hear that?

76
00:06:49,600 --> 00:06:51,239
我什麼都沒聽到  - 沒錯
I don't hear anything.  - Exactly.

77
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,629
好吧！
Oh. Okay!

78
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,077
好了，孩子們，我們到了！下車
Okay. Guys, we are here!Get out of the car.

79
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:58,118
上帝啊，我們在荒郊野外
Oh, God, we're in the middle of nowhere.

80
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:01,318
你們激動嗎？給我個肯定的回答，是的！
Are you so excited?Where's my "yes"? Where's my "yes"? Yes!

81
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:02,590
比誰跑得快
I'll race you!

82
00:07:02,760 --> 00:07:04,991
你們激動嗎？  - 是的！
Are you guys excited?  - Yes!

83
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,157
我很激動！  - 快來，賽迪！
I'm so excited!  - Come on, Sadie!

84
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,840
我自己選房間！
I get my own room!

85
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,674
你開玩笑吧？不准挑房間！
Are you kidding me?No dibs on the rooms!

86
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:12,956
什麼？  - 什麼？
What?  - What?

87
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:16,836
那我可以自己選房間嗎？還是也一樣沒得選？
So do I get to pick my own room?Or do I have no choice in that either?

88
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,671
她遇到心儀的男孩就會忘了新澤西的
Well, first cute boy she meets,she'll forget about Jersey.

89
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,115
很好  - 但願
Great.  - I hope.

90
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:25,475
我等不及了
I can't wait.

91
00:07:26,120 --> 00:07:27,349
過來，賽迪
Come on, Sadie.

92
00:07:28,360 --> 00:07:29,874
賽迪，走吧
Sadie, let's go.

93
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,473
過來啊
Hey, come.

94
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:35,200
你怎麼了？
What's the matter with you?

95
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,113
來啊，小妞
Hey, come on, girl.

96
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:39,878
好吧，隨你
All right, suit yourself.

97
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:54,236
小心台階
Watch your step.

98
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:55,834
借過
Coming through.

99
00:07:56,680 --> 00:07:57,716
哇噢，小心，老爸
Whoa, watch out, Dad.

100
00:07:57,880 --> 00:07:59,712
你想把它放在哪？  - 客廳
Where do you want it?  - In the living room.

101
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,793
安德莉亞，我的風鈴在哪？  - 好像南希拿到另一個房間了
Andrea, where's my wind chime?  - I think Nancy's got it in the other room.

102
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:05,231
謝了！ 南希，看到我的風鈴了嗎？
Thanks! Hey, Nancy,have you seen my wind chime?

103
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:07,039
這個嗎？  - 是的，謝謝
Oh, this one?  - Yeah, thanks.

104
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:10,034
自己來拿  - 南希！放手！給我
You're gonna have to catch it.  - Nancy! Let go! Give it here.

105
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:12,079
你太壞了
You're so mean.

106
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:14,833
媽媽，我可以掛風鈴嗎？
Hey, Mom, can I hang up my wind chime?

107
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:17,390
當然，外面有條繩子，你可以掛在那
Of course. There's a line outside you can hang it on.

108
00:08:17,600 --> 00:08:20,240
親愛的，把艾普麗爾叫進來好嗎？天快黑了
Honey, have April come in, okay?It's gonna be dark soon.

109
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:21,675
好的
Okay.

110
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:33,878
過來，艾普麗爾！媽媽讓我們進屋
Come on, April! Mom wants us inside!

111
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:36,716
看我找到了什麼，辛蒂
Look what I found, Cindy.

112
00:08:56,360 --> 00:08:57,714
一
One...

113
00:08:58,240 --> 00:08:59,276
二
...two...

114
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:00,556
三
...three.

115
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,598
快，快，快，不准偷看
Come on, come on, come on.No peeking.

116
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:04,114
四
Four.

117
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:07,438
披薩吃完了嗎？我不希望浪費
Are you guys done with the pizza?I don't want it going to waste.

118
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,035
快走  - 養你們這群小丫頭很費錢啊
Let's go.  - It's expensive feeding you girls.

119
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,591
七，八，九
Seven, eight, nine, ten.

120
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,910
我該躲哪裏？
Where should I hide?

121
00:09:15,280 --> 00:09:17,272
準備好了嗎，我來了！
Ready or not, here I come!

122
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:20,029
好，拍手
Okay, clap.

123
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,597
哇噢！  - 你們對這屋子還不熟悉
Whoa!  - Guys,You don't know the house well enough.

124
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:31,830
有人會受傷的
Someone's gonna get hurt.

125
00:09:32,000 --> 00:09:33,275
我沒事，我沒事
I'm okay, I'm okay.

126
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:36,560
拍第二次
Second clap.

127
00:09:42,760 --> 00:09:44,080
這是作弊
That's cheating.

128
00:09:56,680 --> 00:09:57,955
拍手
Clap.

129
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:01,874
抓住你了！
Got you!

130
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:04,517
你沒事吧？  - 還好
Are you okay?  - Um,Yeah.

131
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:06,554
弄壞了什麼東西？
All right, what did we break now?

132
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:08,712
我不是故意的  - 麻煩請出來
I didn't mean to.  - Move out of there, please.

133
00:10:08,960 --> 00:10:10,633
是克裏斯蒂的錯
It was Christine's fault.

134
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,031
老天  - 我的錯？上帝啊
Oh, jeez.  - My fault? Oh, my God.

135
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:15,112
是克裏斯蒂干的  - 不，我沒有
Christine did it.  - No, I didn't.

136
00:10:15,280 --> 00:10:17,431
你推我的  - 不，不，你自己退過去的
You pushed me.  - No, no, you fell back.

137
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:20,274
南希，幫我拿一下火柴，好嗎？
Hey, Nancy, can you go get me the matches, please?

138
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:22,316
怎麼了？
What's going on?

139
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,777
南希弄壞東西了  - 閉嘴
Nancy broke something.  - Shut up.

140
00:10:24,004 --> 00:10:24,585
是你！
It was you!

141
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:26,512
什麼壞了？  - 是牆
What broke?  - It's the wall.

142
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:29,718
哇噢！  - 我覺得好像是個地下室什麼的
Whoa!  - I think we have a cellar or something.

143
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,280
我要看，我要看，讓開，讓開，讓開
I wanna see, I wanna see. Move, move, move.

144
00:10:34,040 --> 00:10:36,555
來，火柴，謝謝
Here, matches.Thank you.

145
00:10:37,160 --> 00:10:38,753
我要看  - 你會看到的
I wanna see.  - You can see.

146
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:40,673
我要看嘛  - 你們都會看到的
I wanna see.  - You can all see.

147
00:10:40,840 --> 00:10:42,035
走開！
Move!

148
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:54,072
天
Oh, man.

149
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:02,909
羅傑？
Roger?

150
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:05,355
下面有什麼？
What do you see down there?

151
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:09,039
只是…呃，很難解釋
Just, uh, hard to tell, you know?

152
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:13,156
一架舊鋼琴，還有一堆垃圾
It's an old piano and a whole bunch of garbage.

153
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:17,716
啊，媽的…
Ah. Son of a...

154
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:22,953
哇噢
Wow.

155
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:28,234
羅傑？
Roger?

156
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,000
上來吧
Come on up.

157
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:37,959
我不希望你們下去那裏
I don't want you girls going down there.

158
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:39,839
那裏都是蜘蛛  - 嘔！
That place is loaded with spiders.  - Ew!

159
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,076
別緊張
Just relax.

160
00:11:41,240 --> 00:11:43,550
別這樣，南希，這不好玩
Stop it, Nancy. It's not funny.

161
00:11:43,960 --> 00:11:47,431
不管怎麼說，我們有更多空間了，明早我再下去看看
We've got extra square footage anyway.I'll check it out in the morning.

162
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:49,791
我在想為什麼要封起來  - 不知道
I wonder why it was boarded up.  - I don't know.

163
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:50,996
好了，孩子們，演出結束
Okay,guys.Show's over.

164
00:11:51,160 --> 00:11:52,879
再五分鐘  - 一分都不行
Five minutes.  - No more minutes.

165
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,396
趕緊上床，謝謝合作  - 上床
Up to bed. Please. Thank you.  - Right to bed.

166
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:00,920
累死了
Man, I'm fried.

167
00:12:01,800 --> 00:12:03,473
賽迪有點不對勁
Something's up with Sadie.

168
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:07,590
是啊，不知道她怎麼了，就是不肯進來
Yeah, I don't know what her problem is.Couldn't get her to come inside.

169
00:12:07,960 --> 00:12:09,553
我們不能把她扔在那
We can't leave her out there.

170
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:11,871
沒事的，我把她拴鏈子上了
She's all right. I got her on a chain.

171
00:12:13,160 --> 00:12:15,959
賽迪，安靜點
Sadie, hey, be quiet.

172
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:20,952
謝謝把這一切變為可能
Thanks for making this work.

173
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:22,998
我知道還有很多事要做
I know it was a lot to bite off.

174
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:26,309
會好起來，對嗎？
It's gonna be great, isn't it?

175
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,752
我覺得已經很好了
I think it's great already.

176
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:31,110
是啊
Yeah.

177
00:12:33,160 --> 00:12:35,994
你還累的無法打理新房子嗎？
You still too fried to christen the new house?

178
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:38,440
誰說我累壞了？
Who said I'm fried?

179
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:41,994
誰都沒有累壞
Ain't nobody here's fried.

180
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:18,589
媽媽？
Mom?

181
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:21,196
嗨，你們睡的還好嗎？
Hey. How did you guys sleep?

182
00:13:21,400 --> 00:13:22,550
我好冷
I'm cold.

183
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:24,234
的確有點涼
It is chilly, isn't it?

184
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:28,236
我們可以買一棟廁所實際可用的房子嗎？
Do you think maybe we could have bought a house with a toilet that actually works?

185
00:13:28,400 --> 00:13:29,436
跟你爸說去
Tell your father.

186
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,718
昨晚我房間裏還有股怪味，好像什麼東西死了一樣
And there was a funky smell in my room last night. Like something died.

187
00:13:32,880 --> 00:13:34,473
現在還有嗎？  - 沒了
Is it still there?  - No.

188
00:13:34,640 --> 00:13:35,676
那就沒問題了
Problem solved.

189
00:14:01,400 --> 00:14:02,550
羅傑？
Roger?

190
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,520
羅傑？
Roger?

191
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:07,434
在下面，親愛的
Down here, honey.

192
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:13,636
早上好
Morning.

193
00:14:18,080 --> 00:14:20,720
這可真得花一番大工夫了
This is gonna take some serious elbow grease.

194
00:14:20,920 --> 00:14:22,070
是啊
Yeah.

195
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:24,873
上帝啊
Oh, my God.

196
00:14:31,800 --> 00:14:33,632
這些東西該怎麼處理？
What are we gonna do with all this stuff?

197
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,235
或許我們該先整理一下
Well, we probably ought to go through it

198
00:14:36,400 --> 00:14:38,790
知道嗎？可能有些很值錢的古董
You know?There might be some antiques down here worth a lot of  money.

199
00:14:38,960 --> 00:14:41,634
或者只是一堆前任房主不要的廢物
Yeah, or just a lot of junk the previous owner didn't want.

200
00:14:42,080 --> 00:14:44,117
現在是我們的了  - 別做夢了
It's ours now.  - Knock yourself out.

201
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,757
我去煮點咖啡  - 好的
I'm gonna make some coffee.  - Okay.

202
00:14:46,920 --> 00:14:48,957
我很快就上來，我要試試能否把這爐子修好
I'll be up in a minute,I'm gonna see if I can get this furnace working.

203
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,918
那就太好了，這裏冷死了
Yeah, that'd be nice. It's freezing.

204
00:14:51,080 --> 00:14:52,230
是啊
Yeah.

205
00:15:05,280 --> 00:15:08,034
賽迪！來這裏，賽迪！
Sadie! Come here, Sadie!

206
00:15:08,360 --> 00:15:09,635
媽咪！
Mommy!

207
00:15:10,840 --> 00:15:12,274
媽咪，賽迪在哪？
Mommy, where's Sadie?

208
00:15:12,440 --> 00:15:16,753
她在外面，她現在一定很餓了，你去把她帶過來吧
She's outside. You know, I'm sure she's hungry by now. Why don't you go and get her.

209
00:15:17,760 --> 00:15:18,796
早上好，爸爸
Morning, Dad.

210
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:20,952
可以幫我拿一下嗎？  - 當然
Can you hold this?  - Sure.

211
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:22,793
賽迪！  - 慢點，小皮猴
Sadie!  - Slow it down, Scoot.

212
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:24,235
羅傑  - 怎麼
Roger.  - Yeah.

213
00:15:24,440 --> 00:15:27,558
這鍾停在了3:07，走廊那個也是
This clock stopped at 3:07,and so did the one in the hallway.

214
00:15:27,720 --> 00:15:29,120
這倒挺奇怪的
That's weird.

215
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:32,798
可能是搬家的時候撞壞了吧
Maybe it got knocked around in the move.

216
00:15:32,960 --> 00:15:35,839
說到撞壞，你昨晚對我做了什麼？
Speaking of knocked around,what did you do to me last night?

217
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:38,754
這不是我幹的，是我弄的嗎？  - 我不知道
Ouch. I didn't do that. Did I?  - I don't know.

218
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,355
賽迪！
Sadie!

219
00:15:51,080 --> 00:15:53,356
艾普麗爾！艾普麗爾！
April! April!

220
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:56,115
怎麼…？艾普麗爾！發生什麼事了？
What's...? April! What's going on?

221
00:15:56,280 --> 00:15:58,590
怎麼了？  - 上帝啊！
What happened?  - Oh, my God!

222
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,400
噢，賽迪
Oh, Sadie.

223
00:16:07,687 --> 00:16:09,884
門羅，康乃狄克州，沃倫家

224
00:16:10,520 --> 00:16:12,557
我們把所有東西都鎖在這裏了
We keep everything locked in here.

225
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:14,753
請隨便參觀
Feel free to look around.

226
00:16:15,200 --> 00:16:16,793
就是別碰任何東西
Just don't touch anything.

227
00:16:19,200 --> 00:16:20,759
哇噢
Wow.

228
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,520
太瘋狂了
This is crazy.

229
00:16:25,520 --> 00:16:28,433
這些都是從你們調查的案子中得來的嗎？
So all these are taken from cases you've investigated?

230
00:16:28,600 --> 00:16:32,560
是的，你所看到的一切，不是被詛咒的…
That's right. Everything you see in here is either haunted, cursed...

231
00:16:32,760 --> 00:16:35,673
…就是曾被用於某種儀式的器物
...or has been used in some kind of ritualistic practice.

232
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:37,993
沒有一樣是玩具
Nothing's a toy.

233
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:39,833
甚至是那個玩具猴子
Not even the toy monkey.

234
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:42,714
別碰
Don't touch it.

235
00:16:44,920 --> 00:16:49,392
好吧，是這些不可怕，還是你一點都不擔心…
Oh,  Well, isn't it scary,or doesn't it worry you...

236
00:16:49,560 --> 00:16:51,836
把這些東西放在家裏？
...to have all these items right in your home?

237
00:16:52,000 --> 00:16:55,391
所以我們才讓牧師每個月來這房間賜福一次
That's why we have a priest that comes by once a month to bless the room.

238
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:56,755
我覺得…
Well, the way I see it is...

239
00:16:56,920 --> 00:16:59,560
這些東西放這裏比放在別的地方更安全
It's safer for these things to be in here than out there.

240
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,518
就跟不把槍帶上街一個道理
It's kind of like keeping guns off the street.

241
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:04,752
為什麼不把這些扔進焚化爐銷毀掉？
Why not just throw them in an incinerator? Destroy them.

242
00:17:04,960 --> 00:17:06,838
那樣只是毀了它們的皮囊
Well, that would only destroy the vessel.

243
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:10,159
還是把妖怪封在瓶子裏更好
Sometimes it's better to keep the genie in the bottle.

244
00:17:11,440 --> 00:17:14,194
說起來，安娜貝爾娃娃在這裏嗎？
Say, is the, uh, Annabelle doll here?

245
00:17:16,120 --> 00:17:17,474
這邊走
Right this way.

246
00:17:19,800 --> 00:17:21,075
好的
Yeah.

247
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:32,315
你說她只是個載體？  - 正確
You said she's a conduit?  - That's right.

248
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:33,675
那是什麼意思？
What does that mean?

249
00:17:33,840 --> 00:17:37,675
一個非常強大的惡魔把自己附著在她身上
A very powerful demonic has latched itself onto her.

250
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,799
那當你們在調查這些事件的時候…
So when you guys investigate these hauntings...

251
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:43,191
…是如何避免被他們纏上的呢？
...how do you stop them from latching onto you?

252
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:44,919
我們會做好一切預防措施
We have to take great precaution.

253
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:46,713
那你妻子呢？
But what about your wife?

254
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:48,954
她怎麼了？
What about her?

255
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,878
哥頓神父告訴我…
Well, Father Gordon told me that...

256
00:17:52,040 --> 00:17:53,520
那是不一樣的
Well, that was different.

257
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:56,879
驅魔的時經常會有這樣的事情發生
What happened to my wife happened during an exorcism.

258
00:17:57,040 --> 00:17:58,713
有什麼區別？
Well, what's the difference?

259
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:01,755
抱歉
Excuse me.

260
00:18:03,560 --> 00:18:04,789
親愛的，你在幹嗎？
Honey, what are you doing?

261
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:06,390
過來
Come here.

262
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:08,910
你更瞭解，是嗎？
You know better. All right?

263
00:18:09,080 --> 00:18:10,514
喬治安娜？
Georgiana?

264
00:18:10,800 --> 00:18:13,076
你碰過什麼東西嗎？  - 沒有
Come on. Did you touch anything?  - No.

265
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:14,560
好的，過來，親愛的
All right, come on, honey.

266
00:18:15,400 --> 00:18:17,960
喬治安娜！把朱蒂帶上樓好嗎？  - 噢，當然
Georgiana! Could you take Judy upstairs?  - Oh, sure.

267
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:20,589
無論如何你都不能進那間房間，還記得嗎？
You can't go into this room,no matter what, remember?

268
00:18:20,760 --> 00:18:22,194
是的，爸爸  - 好的
Yes, Daddy.  - All right.

269
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:24,270
去吧  - 好的，過來
Go on.  - Okay, come on.

270
00:18:24,440 --> 00:18:27,478
我去給你找點零食，好嗎？來吧
Let's see if I can find you a little snack, okay? Come on.

271
00:18:35,720 --> 00:18:37,791
你們在做什麼？
Hey. What's going on in here?

272
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:40,429
爸爸，看  - 你真漂亮
Daddy, look.  - You look very pretty.

273
00:18:40,600 --> 00:18:42,956
好了，完成了，穿好衣服吃飯去
All right, all done.Go get dressed for dinner.

274
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:45,954
我就穿這個去吃飯  - 不，不行
I'm wearing it to dinner.  - No, you're not!

275
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:48,355
給你
Here you go.

276
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:50,440
怎麼樣了？
How'd it go?

277
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:52,717
我覺得他或許是想寫一篇正面報道
Oh, I think he may write a positive article.

278
00:18:52,880 --> 00:18:54,792
噢，一個有神論者
Ooh, a non-skeptic.

279
00:18:55,400 --> 00:18:56,675
這是個不錯的改變
That's a pleasant change.

280
00:18:56,840 --> 00:18:57,990
是的
Yeah.

281
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:06,633
別再自責了
Stop blaming yourself.

282
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,034
沒放糖
No sugar.

283
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:21,674
很快回來
Be right back.

284
00:20:17,480 --> 00:20:19,437
這不好玩，南希
Not funny, Nancy.

285
00:20:20,600 --> 00:20:21,829
什麼？
What?

286
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:24,597
別抓我的腳
Stop grabbing my foot.

287
00:20:24,800 --> 00:20:26,917
閉嘴，我什麼都沒做
Shut up, I didn't do anything.

288
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,194
是啊，是啊
Yeah, right.

289
00:20:30,920 --> 00:20:32,877
別再放屁了
And stop farting.

290
00:20:33,320 --> 00:20:35,118
真的很臭
It really stinks.

291
00:20:35,560 --> 00:20:39,031
別怪我頭上，是你自己
Don't blame that on me. It's you.

292
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:56,390
老爸？
Dad?

293
00:22:56,600 --> 00:22:58,592
安德莉亞，為什麼不睡覺？
Andrea, what are you doing out of bed?

294
00:22:58,840 --> 00:23:00,035
那是什麼聲音？
What's that sound?

295
00:23:00,200 --> 00:23:04,114
是辛蒂，她在我房間，她又夢遊了
It's Cindy. She's in my room.She's sleepwalking again.

296
00:23:19,560 --> 00:23:21,677
我從沒見過她這樣子
I've never seen her do this before.

297
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:28,230
我記得你說夢遊的時候不要吵醒她
I remembered you saying not to wake her if she's like this.

298
00:23:28,400 --> 00:23:30,312
是的，我們把她放回床裏
No, we just put her back to bed.

299
00:23:30,480 --> 00:23:32,995
嗨，嗨，寶貝，噓
Hey, hey. Sweetie. Shh.

300
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,155
我們回床裏去
Let's go back to bed.

301
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:47,953
她沒事了，晚安
She's okay. Good night.

302
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:49,315
晚安
Night.

303
00:24:02,320 --> 00:24:05,438
她又夢遊了？好久都沒這樣過了
She's sleepwalking again?She hasn't done that for awhile.

304
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:09,192
她停在了安德莉亞的房間裏，嚇壞她了
She ended up in Andrea's room too.I think kind of freaked her out.

305
00:24:09,360 --> 00:24:11,955
這不太妙，我們該怎麼做？  - 不知道
That's not good. What are we gonna do?  - I don't know.

306
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:14,680
親愛的，這裏又有一塊淤青了  - 嗯？
Honey, you got another bruise here.  - Hmm?

307
00:24:14,960 --> 00:24:16,280
疼嗎？
Does that hurt?

308
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:19,356
真奇怪
That's weird.

309
00:24:19,560 --> 00:24:22,473
我不知道，要不要去看一下醫生？
I don't know. Will you do me a favor,go see a doctor for that?

310
00:24:23,320 --> 00:24:25,596
好，我會的，開車小心  - 知道了
Yeah, I will. Drive safe.  - Yeah.

311
00:24:25,760 --> 00:24:27,479
我愛你  - 我也愛你
I love you.  - I love you too.

312
00:24:57,960 --> 00:24:59,076
再見！
Bye!

313
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:00,720
愛你們！
Love you!

314
00:25:01,960 --> 00:25:04,759
辛蒂，拿午餐了嗎？  - 拿了
Cindy, you have your lunch?  - Yeah.

315
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:08,391
是的
Yes, I do.

316
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,392
我很想賽迪
I miss Sadie a lot.

317
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:12,916
她是我最好的朋友
She was my best friend.

318
00:25:14,120 --> 00:25:15,998
你是我的朋友，對嗎？
You're my friend, right?

319
00:25:17,680 --> 00:25:19,239
好的，我們一起玩吧
Yeah, let's play.

320
00:25:25,440 --> 00:25:28,114
你在跟誰說話？  - 羅利
Who are you talking to?  - Rory.

321
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:29,670
羅利？
Rory?

322
00:25:30,080 --> 00:25:32,072
他是我的新朋友  - 噢，是嗎？
He's my new friend.  - Oh, really?

323
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:35,312
是的，你想見他嗎？  - 好啊，怎麼見？
Yeah, do you want to see him?  - Yeah. Uh-huh. How?

324
00:25:35,480 --> 00:25:36,914
用這個
With this.

325
00:25:37,080 --> 00:25:40,756
當音樂停的時候，你會看到他在鏡子裏，站在你身後
When the music stops, you see him in the mirror standing behind you.

326
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:42,790
好吧
Okay.

327
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:44,872
但你得擰發條
But you have to twist the key.

328
00:25:45,040 --> 00:25:46,235
好的
Okay.

329
00:26:09,920 --> 00:26:11,400
砰！媽咪！  - 噢！
Boo, Mommy!  - Oh!

330
00:26:11,920 --> 00:26:14,879
艾普麗爾，你嚇死我了  - 中招！
April, you just gave me a heart attack.  - Got you!

331
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:18,912
好吧，我猜羅利不想見我，是嗎？
Well, okay, I guess Rory doesn't want to see me, huh?

332
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,309
噢，好吧
Oh, well.

333
00:26:20,560 --> 00:26:22,153
我們可以玩捉迷藏嗎？
Can we play hide-and-clap?

334
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:24,596
捉迷…？噢，親愛的，我不想玩
Hide-and-cla--?Oh, honey, I don't want to play.

335
00:26:24,760 --> 00:26:28,356
求你！她們都不讓我玩  - 好吧，好吧
Please! Nobody ever lets me play.  - Okay, okay.

336
00:26:30,040 --> 00:26:33,317
記住，你得要求我拍三次手
Remember, you get to ask me for three claps.

337
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,516
好的
Okay.

338
00:26:34,680 --> 00:26:37,878
一，二，三
One, two, three.

339
00:26:38,040 --> 00:26:39,679
我要躲起來了！  - 好的
I'm gonna go hide now!  - Okay.

340
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:42,514
四，五…
Four, five...

341
00:26:42,680 --> 00:26:45,559
六，七…
...six, seven...

342
00:26:45,720 --> 00:26:48,076
八，九…
...eight, nine...

343
00:26:48,680 --> 00:26:49,955
十！
...ten!

344
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:54,154
拍第一次手！
First clap!

345
00:27:13,680 --> 00:27:15,478
噢，該死
Ow. Shit.

346
00:27:15,640 --> 00:27:17,154
拍第二次手！
Second clap!

347
00:27:32,680 --> 00:27:35,036
艾普麗爾
April.

348
00:27:40,920 --> 00:27:42,434
艾普麗爾
April.

349
00:27:53,000 --> 00:27:55,674
我知道你藏在哪裏
Oh, I know where you're hiding.

350
00:27:55,880 --> 00:27:57,951
拍第三次手
Give me the third clap.

351
00:28:06,520 --> 00:28:07,954
我要把你抓出來嘍
I'm gonna get you now.

352
00:28:15,320 --> 00:28:17,039
我聽到你呼吸了
I can hear you breathing.

353
00:28:17,640 --> 00:28:19,040
艾普麗爾
April.

354
00:28:20,040 --> 00:28:21,440
艾普麗爾
April.

355
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,436
你把眼罩拿下來了，我贏了！
You took your blindfold off. I win!

356
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:34,475
你一點都不用心，媽媽，我在克裏斯蒂跟南希的房間
You weren't even warm, Mom.I was in Christine and Nancy's room.

357
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,795
總得給我留一條路線，不然我會失去卡車保險的
I gotta have some routes here,or I'm gonna lose the insurance on the rig.

358
00:28:44,840 --> 00:28:47,480
這才只有半價啊，兄弟
That's like half of my rate, man.

359
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:51,152
嗯，好的
Yeah, okay.

360
00:28:52,240 --> 00:28:54,232
我…好吧，我接下了
I'll, uh... Yeah, I'll take it.

361
00:28:54,400 --> 00:28:55,675
謝謝
Thank you.

362
00:28:58,400 --> 00:29:01,359
什麼路線？  - 是…佛羅里達
What's the route?  - It's, uh, Florida.

363
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:04,240
往返一個星期，我明天出發
It's a week turnaround. I start tomorrow.

364
00:29:05,040 --> 00:29:06,554
我們會撐過去的
We'll get through this.

365
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:09,596
是的
Yeah.

366
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,080
來，去睡覺吧
Come on, let's go to bed.

367
00:29:35,480 --> 00:29:38,996
住手，南希，這一點都不好玩
Stop it, Nancy. It's not funny anymore.

368
00:29:39,160 --> 00:29:42,232
我要睡覺，求你別再抓我的腳了
I'm trying to sleep,please stop grabbing my feet.

369
00:31:26,600 --> 00:31:28,034
南希？
Nancy?

370
00:31:30,040 --> 00:31:31,599
南希？
Nancy?

371
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:35,719
你在幹嗎？
What are you doing?

372
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:40,640
克裏斯蒂？
Christine?

373
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:43,430
你還好嗎？
Are you all right?

374
00:31:45,360 --> 00:31:46,760
你看到了嗎？
Do you see it?

375
00:31:49,560 --> 00:31:50,755
看到什麼？
See what?

376
00:31:56,240 --> 00:31:58,311
有人在門後
There's someone behind the door.

377
00:31:58,480 --> 00:31:59,709
什麼？
What?

378
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,920
有個人站在那裏
There's someone standing over there.

379
00:32:07,200 --> 00:32:09,396
我沒看到任何人
I don't see anyone.

380
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:14,150
它正看著我們
It's looking right at us.

381
00:32:23,520 --> 00:32:24,920
南希，不要！南希
Nancy, don't! Nancy.

382
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:27,515
不，不，你看，你看
No, no. Look. Look.

383
00:32:27,680 --> 00:32:31,151
看，沒有人，看到了嗎？
Look, there's no one...no one here. See?

384
00:32:32,040 --> 00:32:34,794
又是那味道
Ugh. It's that smell again.

385
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,271
噢，上帝啊
Oh, my God.

386
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:40,913
它就站在你背後
It's standing right behind you.

387
00:32:56,720 --> 00:32:59,918
克裏斯蒂？！克裏斯蒂！克裏斯蒂！
Christine?! Christine! Christine!

388
00:33:00,960 --> 00:33:02,440
天，開不了…
God, it won't op...

389
00:33:03,800 --> 00:33:05,712
克裏斯蒂！  - 不！不！不！
Christine!  - No! No! No!

390
00:33:05,920 --> 00:33:08,913
怎麼了？發生什麼事了？  - 有個人在這裏！
What's going on? What happened?  - There was someone else in here!

391
00:33:09,080 --> 00:33:10,116
什麼？  - 哪裏？
What?  - Where?

392
00:33:10,280 --> 00:33:13,557
門邊，它在門背後
By the door. It was behind the door.

393
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:16,275
寶貝，什麼都沒有，沒人在那裏
Honey, there's nothing in here.There's nobody in here.

394
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:18,238
有個人在這裏！
There was someone else in here!

395
00:33:18,400 --> 00:33:22,838
我正在睡覺，然後覺得有人抓著我的腳
I was just sleeping, and then I felt somebody grab my feet.

396
00:33:23,000 --> 00:33:25,310
我以為是南希
So I thought it was Nancy.

397
00:33:25,520 --> 00:33:28,797
寶貝，我非常確定那只是個噩夢
Well, honey, I'm pretty sure that it was just a bad dream.

398
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:31,555
不是！它跟我說話了！
No! It talked to me!

399
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:33,638
它說…
It said...

400
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:37,870
它想要我們全家都死掉
...that it wants my family dead.

401
00:33:44,920 --> 00:33:47,389
溫斯頓先生！
Mr. Winston!

402
00:33:47,960 --> 00:33:49,553
溫斯頓？溫斯頓？
Winston? Winston?

403
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:51,320
到他後面
Get behind him.

404
00:33:52,120 --> 00:33:53,156
你要去哪？
Where you off to?

405
00:33:53,320 --> 00:33:55,789
打算去店裏買點東西
I just gotta run to the store for a few things.

406
00:33:57,160 --> 00:33:59,959
為什麼要這樣？  - 什麼？什麼意思？
Why do you even try?  - What? What do you mean?

407
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:02,680
15年來，你有哪次是能騙過我的？
In 15 years have you ever been able to lie to me?

408
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:06,799
哥頓神父打電話來，說他有個案子想讓我們跟進一下
Father Gordon called. He's got a case he wants us to look into.

409
00:34:06,960 --> 00:34:09,520
我說我會過去看看的，羅琳，是「我」會
I said I'd go check it out myself.Lorraine, myself.

410
00:34:09,680 --> 00:34:11,034
我跟你一起去
I'm going with you.

411
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:14,270
我知道你擔心那個會再次發生
I know you're worried it's gonna happen again.

412
00:34:14,440 --> 00:34:16,238
是啊，千真萬確
Yeah, I am. I really am.

413
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:23,920
或許我們該歇一歇了，寫本書什麼的
Maybe it's just time we take a break.Write that book.

414
00:34:25,200 --> 00:34:27,954
還記得結婚那晚你跟我說了什麼嗎？
Do you remember what you said to me on our wedding night?

415
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,959
「能再來一次嗎？」
"Can we do it again?"

416
00:34:32,840 --> 00:34:33,990
在這之後
After that.

417
00:34:36,440 --> 00:34:40,229
你說上帝把我們撮合在一起是有原因的，對嗎？
You said that God brought us together for a reason. Right?

418
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:43,359
我很確定不是為了寫書什麼的
I'm pretty sure it's not to write a book.

419
00:34:46,040 --> 00:34:47,713
我去穿件衣服
I'm gonna get dressed.

420
00:34:51,160 --> 00:34:53,356
我們已經確定那東西就在這閣樓上
We've isolated the disturbances to the attic.

421
00:34:53,520 --> 00:34:54,840
你們聽
Now I just want you to listen for a second.

422
00:34:56,200 --> 00:34:57,270
噢，上帝啊，就是這個
Oh, my God, that's it.

423
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:00,354
再來一次，艾德
Do it again, Ed.

424
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:05,551
現在只是我在踩地板而已，但你們從水管裏放水的時候
Right now it's just my weight.But you take the water coming off the pipe...

425
00:35:05,720 --> 00:35:08,280
會把風從那破窗子裏帶進來
...combined with the wind coming through the broken window...

426
00:35:08,440 --> 00:35:10,750
然後這些木條就會脹大，互相摩擦
...these boards are gonna expand and rub against each other.

427
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:14,715
滿屋子都有這聲音，是因為這些管子是連著暖氣片的
You heard it all through the house because of these pipes leading to the radiator.

428
00:35:14,920 --> 00:35:16,832
所以這地方並沒有鬧鬼？
So this place isn't haunted?

429
00:35:17,000 --> 00:35:18,593
是的，不太可能
No, it rarely is.

430
00:35:18,800 --> 00:35:22,555
有時候的確是可以有合理解釋的
Yeah, there's usually always some kind of rational explanation.

431
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:07,440
丫頭們，該睡覺了
Girls, it's way past your bedtime.

432
00:38:04,560 --> 00:38:06,040
是誰？
Who is that?

433
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:11,000
誰在下面，我要把你關起來了
Who's ever down there,I'm gonna lock you in now!

434
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,434
救命！
Help!

435
00:40:06,600 --> 00:40:08,398
安德莉亞，救命！
Andrea! Help!

436
00:40:33,080 --> 00:40:35,515
嗨，想玩捉迷藏嗎？
Hey, wanna play hide-and-clap?

437
00:41:10,160 --> 00:41:11,389
辛蒂？
Cindy?

438
00:41:26,200 --> 00:41:28,032
好吧，那…
Okay, now....

439
00:41:29,280 --> 00:41:30,509
是這樣嗎？
All right?

440
00:41:30,920 --> 00:41:32,274
沒錯，過來
All right, come on.

441
00:41:32,640 --> 00:41:33,869
過來
Come on.

442
00:41:34,840 --> 00:41:36,115
就這樣
There you go.

443
00:41:36,720 --> 00:41:40,077
好了，今晚就跟我一起睡了，好嗎？
Okay, you can just sleep with me tonight,all right?

444
00:41:44,960 --> 00:41:46,314
來
There you go.

445
00:41:47,720 --> 00:41:48,870
對了
There.

446
00:42:52,520 --> 00:42:54,955
安德莉亞？  - 救命！救命！救命！
Andrea?  - Help! Help! Help!

447
00:42:57,160 --> 00:42:58,753
誰在裏面？  - 安德莉亞？
Who's in here?  - Andrea!

448
00:42:58,920 --> 00:43:01,116
安德莉亞？安德莉亞！
Andrea? Andrea!

449
00:43:01,280 --> 00:43:02,396
在這裏！
In here!

450
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:05,035
救命，爸爸！救命，是安德莉亞！
Help, Daddy! Help, it's Andrea!

451
00:43:05,200 --> 00:43:06,634
誰在這裏？  - 安德莉亞！
Who's in here?  - Andrea!

452
00:43:07,120 --> 00:43:08,600
發生什麼事了？
What happened?

453
00:43:10,760 --> 00:43:13,195
該死的，誰能告訴我這裏發生了什麼事？
Somebody, goddamn it,tell me what's going on here?

454
00:43:17,400 --> 00:43:22,270
恐懼就是，未知事物或強烈危機感所致的…
Fear is defined as a feeling of agitation and anxiety caused by the presence...

455
00:43:22,440 --> 00:43:23,954
情緒波動及焦慮
...or imminence of danger.

456
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:28,632
無論是鬼魂、妖魔還是邪物，都以此為生
Whether it's a ghost, a spirit or an entity, they all feed on it.
(馬薩諸塞西部大學，韋克菲爾德)

457
00:43:28,800 --> 00:43:29,836
這是莫裏斯
Take Maurice here.

458
00:43:30,040 --> 00:43:33,192
一個三年級都沒念完的加籍法裔農民
A French-Canadian farmer with no more than a third-grade education...

459
00:43:33,360 --> 00:43:36,876
被附身之後，說著一口我聽過最標準的拉丁語
...yet after he was possessed,spoke some of the best Latin I'd ever heard.

460
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:38,269
有時還倒過來說
Sometimes backwards.

461
00:43:38,440 --> 00:43:42,150
他一直被他的父親騷擾、折磨著
He'd been molested by his father,who had also tortured him repeatedly.

462
00:43:43,440 --> 00:43:45,796
一個把他當做宿主的暗靈
A dark spirit made its home in this man.

463
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:50,398
你們看他的眼睛，會發現他在流血淚
Now, if you look into his eyes,you can see him tearing blood.

464
00:43:57,960 --> 00:43:59,394
還有這樣…
And like that...

465
00:43:59,560 --> 00:44:03,713
…從身體裏浮現出一個倒十字架
...an upside-down cross started to appear from within his body.

466
00:44:06,600 --> 00:44:08,671
好，德魯，可以開燈了
All right, Drew, you can hit the lights.

467
00:44:10,360 --> 00:44:12,716
你會親自主持驅魔儀式嗎？
Did you personally perform the exorcism?

468
00:44:12,920 --> 00:44:15,719
不，我沒有被授權，但我協助過很多
No, I'm not authorized.But I've assisted on many.

469
00:44:15,920 --> 00:44:17,832
要知道，驅魔是非常危險的…
See, an exorcism can be very dangerous...

470
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:21,038
不僅只對受害者而言，對屋裏的所有人都一樣
...not only for the victim,but for anyone in the room.

471
00:44:21,720 --> 00:44:24,110
莫裏斯怎樣了？  - 他試圖殺了他妻子…
What happened to Maurice?  - He tried to kill his wife...

472
00:44:24,400 --> 00:44:27,632
…但只打傷了她的胳膊，然後他把槍對準了自己
...but instead shot her in the arm and then turned the gun on himself.

473
00:44:27,800 --> 00:44:31,237
莫裏斯的生活很悲慘…
Maurice had a very troubled life with little to live for...

474
00:44:31,400 --> 00:44:34,279
…甚至連驅魔都無法救回他
...and not even an exorcist could bring him back.

475
00:44:34,840 --> 00:44:37,878
由此，讓我們看一下惡魔活動的三個階段
Which brings us to the three stages of demonic activity:

476
00:44:38,040 --> 00:44:40,271
出現，騷擾，附身
Infestation, oppression and possession.

477
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:41,794
首先，「出現」
Now, infestation:

478
00:44:41,960 --> 00:44:45,920
一般就是說話聲、腳步聲以及感覺有另外一個人存在…
That's the whispering, the footsteps,the feeling of another presence...

479
00:44:46,120 --> 00:44:49,750
…很快就會發展成第二階段「騷擾」，
...which ultimately grows into oppression, the second stage.

480
00:44:49,920 --> 00:44:52,196
所以受害者一般都是那些…
Now this is where the victim,and it's usually the one...

481
00:44:52,360 --> 00:44:54,238
…比較容易受外部力量影響的…
...who's the most psychologically vulnerable...

482
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:57,279
…心理承受能力比較差的人
...is targeted specifically by an external force.

483
00:44:57,440 --> 00:45:00,877
把受害者嚇倒，摧毀他們的意志
Breaks the victim down.Crushes their will.

484
00:45:01,080 --> 00:45:06,280
在他們最脆弱的時候，就發展到了最後也就是第三階段，「附身」
And, once in a weakened state, leads them to the third and final stage: possession.

485
00:45:09,440 --> 00:45:10,999
嗨，艾德？羅琳？  - 是的
Hey, Ed? Lorraine?  - Yeah.

486
00:45:11,160 --> 00:45:13,595
有人想跟你們聊聊
There's someone here that would like to talk to you.

487
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:14,796
嗨  - 謝謝，德魯
Hi.  - Thanks, Drew.

488
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:16,440
謝謝  - 沒事，待會兒見
Thank you.  - Sure，I'll see you later.

489
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:17,670
有什麼可以幫你的？
How can we help you?

490
00:45:17,840 --> 00:45:22,153
我房子裏發生了很可怕的事情，你們可以來看一下嗎？
There's something horrible happening in my house. Could you come and take a look?

491
00:45:22,440 --> 00:45:24,272
嗯…呃…今天有點晚了
You know, uh, it's getting kinda late.

492
00:45:24,440 --> 00:45:27,194
我們要回家了  - 不，你們不明白
We really need to be head to our family.  - No,You don't understand.

493
00:45:27,360 --> 00:45:30,239
事實上我們知道，很多東西是可以有合理解釋的…
But we do. There's usually some sort of rational explanation...

494
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:35,156
我五個女兒都被嚇壞了，我擔心這東西會傷害我們
I have five daughters who are scared to death.I'm so afraid this thing wants to hurt us.

495
00:45:35,320 --> 00:45:39,155
你們也有女兒，難道你們就不會竭盡所能去保護她嗎？求你們
You have a daughter. Wouldn't you do anything you could to protect her? Please.

496
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:41,516
求你們來看一下可以嗎？
Please can you come and take a look?

497
00:45:42,960 --> 00:45:44,235
好的，當然
Of course we will.

498
00:45:45,120 --> 00:45:46,600
好的，當然
Of course we will.

499
00:46:06,680 --> 00:46:08,433
孩子們，趕緊整理一下，謝謝
Hey,You guys straighten up? Thanks.

500
00:46:14,360 --> 00:46:15,680
你好  - 嗨
Hello. Hi.  - Hi. Hi.

501
00:46:15,840 --> 00:46:17,240
非常感謝能來
Thanks for coming.

502
00:46:18,040 --> 00:46:19,713
你好，我是羅傑  - 羅琳
Hi, I'm Roger.  - Lorraine.

503
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:22,196
你好，幸會，羅傑，我是艾德·沃倫
Hey, nice to meet you, Roger. Ed Warren.

504
00:46:22,840 --> 00:46:24,638
非常感謝能來  - 請進來吧
Thanks for coming.  - Please, come in.

505
00:46:24,840 --> 00:46:26,035
謝謝
Thank you.

506
00:46:27,600 --> 00:46:28,670
那…
So....

507
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:31,833
噢，天啊，看看，這些美女們都是誰？
Oh, my God. Look at you all.Who are these beautiful young women?

508
00:46:32,000 --> 00:46:35,357
這是安德莉亞，老大，南希、辛蒂、克裏斯蒂…
This is Andrea, the oldest,Nancy, Cindy, Christine...

509
00:46:35,560 --> 00:46:37,119
…還有艾普麗爾
...and April.

510
00:46:38,840 --> 00:46:40,274
這是沃倫先生和沃倫太太
It's Mr. and Mrs. Warren.

511
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:43,554
我們現在都睡在樓下
We're all sleeping down here now.

512
00:46:44,000 --> 00:46:46,754
孩子們有點安全感，也更暖和一些
The girls feel safer and it's warmer.

513
00:46:47,120 --> 00:46:50,636
我一直開著暖氣，但這房子就是冷得要命
I'm constantly turning up the heat,but the house is always freezing.

514
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:52,712
爐子沒什麼問題
It's not a problem with the furnace.

515
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:54,155
我是說，我找不出原因
I mean, not that I can find.

516
00:46:59,400 --> 00:47:03,155
前幾晚情況越來越糟糕了
It's gotten a lot worse the past few nights.

517
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:09,039
有股難聞的味道，像爛肉一樣，滿屋子都是
There's this awful smell, like rotting meat.It moves around the house.

518
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:13,070
呃…
Uh....

519
00:47:13,240 --> 00:47:14,435
什麼？怎麼了？
What? What is it?

520
00:47:15,160 --> 00:47:20,519
腐臭味有可能是某種惡魔活動徵兆
Well, rancid smells could indicate some type of demonic activity.

521
00:47:20,760 --> 00:47:21,830
噢，上帝啊
Oh, my God.

522
00:47:26,280 --> 00:47:28,556
這是為了防止晚上發出碰門聲
That's to keep those doors from banging at night.

523
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:32,157
不然，整晚都會像這樣響個不停
Otherwise, it's like...All night long, just like that.

524
00:47:33,520 --> 00:47:35,637
每天都會發生？  - 是的
Does it come in threes?  - Yeah.

525
00:47:35,800 --> 00:47:36,950
天亮就停？
It stops at dawn?

526
00:47:37,560 --> 00:47:38,755
對
Uh-huh.

527
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:44,037
有時這意味著對三聖的不敬
Well, sometimes it's meant as an insult to the Trinity:

528
00:47:44,200 --> 00:47:46,157
聖父、聖子、聖靈
The Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit.

529
00:47:47,880 --> 00:47:51,476
知道嗎，這是非常邪惡的東西，但我們有辦法…
You know, it's the damndest thing,but we also get all kinds of birds...

530
00:47:51,680 --> 00:47:54,639
…可以把它從這房子裏找出來消滅掉
...that will just fly against the side of the house and break their necks.

531
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:56,439
是嗎？
Hm. Really?

532
00:47:56,640 --> 00:47:59,030
鍾都停在了凌晨3:07
And the clocks stop at 3:07 a.m.

533
00:47:59,200 --> 00:48:01,271
所有的？  - 每個都是
All of them?  - Every one.

534
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:07,434
噢，這些原本都是掛在樓梯上的
Oh, we were hanging those along the stairs.

535
00:48:07,600 --> 00:48:11,879
有東西老是會把它們弄下來，所以就不掛回去了
Something just kept knocking them down,so we stopped hanging them up.

536
00:48:15,320 --> 00:48:17,596
我一直在說
That's what I was talking about.

537
00:48:17,920 --> 00:48:19,673
我們搬來的時候它就已經在了
It was here when we moved in.

538
00:48:19,840 --> 00:48:22,036
地下室裏還有很多東西
There's also a lot of stuff in the cellar.

539
00:48:25,120 --> 00:48:26,440
帶我去地下室看看
Show me the cellar.

540
00:48:38,560 --> 00:48:41,155
看看她都讓我幹了些什麼
Look what she made me do.

541
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:43,790
發現什麼了嗎，親愛的？
You picking up anything in here, hon?

542
00:48:47,520 --> 00:48:50,274
這裏發生過很可怕的事情，艾德
Something awful happened here, Ed.

543
00:48:54,080 --> 00:48:57,312
這些淤青，是來這裏之後出現的嗎？
Those bruises, they from something that happened here?

544
00:48:57,480 --> 00:49:01,520
這是因為我身體缺鐵什麼的
Oh, it's some iron deficiency thing I have.

545
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:07,070
發生了那麼多事，你們為什麼不搬走？
You know, with all that's been going on,why haven't you just moved out?

546
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:09,357
不知道我們可以搬去哪
I don't know where we'd move to, you know?

547
00:49:09,520 --> 00:49:13,833
我們把所有錢都花在了這裏，還進行了很多整修
We got all our money tied up in this place and had a lot of repairs on top of that.

548
00:49:14,480 --> 00:49:18,474
我也不知道誰可以長期收留我們一家七口人
And I don't know anybody whose gonna take in a family of seven indefinitely.

549
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:20,558
所以我們找到了你們
That's why we tracked you down.

550
00:49:21,040 --> 00:49:22,793
很榮幸你們能來找我們
We're glad you found us.

551
00:49:23,280 --> 00:49:25,590
好，開始吧
All right, let's get started.

552
00:49:27,720 --> 00:49:31,157
我叫艾德·沃倫，今天是1971年11月1日
My name is Ed Warren.It's November 1st, 1971.

553
00:49:31,360 --> 00:49:33,352
我現在跟卡洛琳·佩倫坐在一起…
I'm sitting here with Carolyn Perron...

554
00:49:33,520 --> 00:49:37,719
…她的家庭正經歷著靈異事件
...who, with her family, has been experiencing supernatural occurrences.

555
00:49:38,640 --> 00:49:40,120
好，開始吧
Okay, go ahead.

556
00:49:41,640 --> 00:49:43,040
從哪裏說起？
Where do I start?

557
00:49:43,600 --> 00:49:45,273
從初次異常現象開始
From the first occurrence.

558
00:49:46,320 --> 00:49:48,357
我覺得應該是那些鍾
I guess it was the clocks.

559
00:49:48,520 --> 00:49:50,477
爸爸媽媽跟我說你有個朋友
Mom and Dad tell me that you have a friend.

560
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:52,871
他叫羅利，他也住在這裏
His name's Rory.He lives here too.

561
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:54,872
嗯  - 但他一直很悲傷
Hmm.  - But he's always sad.

562
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:56,076
為什麼？
Why is that?

563
00:49:56,240 --> 00:50:00,029
他不告訴我，可能有什麼不好的事情發生在他身上了
He won't tell me but I think something bad happened to him.

564
00:50:02,760 --> 00:50:04,991
可以讓我見見羅利嗎？
Do you mind if I try to see Rory?

565
00:51:36,080 --> 00:51:37,150
嗨
Hey.

566
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:49,195
怎麼了？
What is it?

567
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:14,479
我們是從銀行拍賣來的，所以不知道之前誰住在這裏
We bought it at auction from the bank, so,you know, we never knew who lived here.

568
00:52:19,160 --> 00:52:24,360
羅琳跟我都覺得你們的房子需要「清潔」一下
Well, Lorraine and I both feel that what your house needs is a cleansing.

569
00:52:25,640 --> 00:52:26,835
一場驅魔儀式
An exorcism.

570
00:52:28,440 --> 00:52:29,874
什麼，驅魔？
What, exorcism?

571
00:52:31,840 --> 00:52:34,799
我一直以為驅魔是僅針對人的
I thought that was something that you do to people.

572
00:52:35,000 --> 00:52:36,354
不，不一定的
No, not necessarily, no.

573
00:52:37,000 --> 00:52:38,320
我們得離開這裏
We have to get out of here.

574
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:40,472
恐怕這於事無補
I'm afraid that's not gonna help.

575
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:44,796
羅琳看到了一些…
Lorraine saw something, which--

576
00:52:44,960 --> 00:52:46,235
你說吧，親愛的
Go ahead, hon.

577
00:52:48,680 --> 00:52:52,037
我看到你們的房子裏有邪惡之物出沒
I've been seeing the dark entity that haunts your house...

578
00:52:52,200 --> 00:52:53,714
…外面也有
...and your land.

579
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:01,756
第一次看到它是在走進你們家門的時候
I saw it first when I came through your door.

580
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:04,116
它就靠在你背上
It was latched to your back.

581
00:53:06,480 --> 00:53:10,679
第二次是在走進客廳的時候，它跟女孩們在一起
And then I saw it again with the girls when we walked into the living room.

582
00:53:11,600 --> 00:53:13,876
無論你們去哪裏…
And it doesn't matter where you go...

583
00:53:14,080 --> 00:53:17,198
…這邪物會一直跟著你們
...this dark entity has latched itself to your family...

584
00:53:17,360 --> 00:53:18,874
…吸食你們
...and it's feeding off you.

585
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:24,077
哪怕我們離開也一樣？
Even if we leave?

586
00:53:24,240 --> 00:53:26,914
有時候鬼纏身，就像是踩到了口香糖
Sometimes when you get haunted,it's like stepping on gum.

587
00:53:27,480 --> 00:53:29,358
會一直粘著你
You take it with you.

588
00:53:30,280 --> 00:53:33,512
我得說，你們這裏有很多幽靈…
Look, I gotta tell you,you have a lot of spirits in here...

589
00:53:33,680 --> 00:53:38,277
…但這個是我們最擔心的，因為它充滿了仇恨
...but this is the one that I'm most worried about, because it is so hateful.

590
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:41,999
好吧，那我們該怎麼做？叫個牧師來嗎？
Okay, so what do we do?Can we call a priest?

591
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:43,480
那麼簡單就好了
I wish it were that easy.

592
00:53:43,640 --> 00:53:47,634
驅魔是一種很古老的儀式，需要很多年的訓練
Performing an exorcism is an archaic procedure. Requires years of training.

593
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:52,560
哪怕這樣，慘劇還是會時常發生
And even then,I have seen it go horribly wrong.

594
00:53:53,520 --> 00:53:57,230
但在這之前，首先要獲得教堂的授權
But before we even get that far,the church has to authorize it first.

595
00:53:57,400 --> 00:54:00,632
就是說我們要調查、收集證物及提供證據…
It means we gotta investigate,gather evidence and provide proof...

596
00:54:00,840 --> 00:54:02,320
…這才是難點
...and that's the hard part.

597
00:54:04,480 --> 00:54:06,199
孩子們受過洗禮嗎？
Have your children been baptized?

598
00:54:06,360 --> 00:54:10,673
不，沒有，我們不常去教堂
Uh, no, we never got around to that.We're not really a churchgoing family.

599
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:14,516
或許應該重新考慮一下，我們的出現或許會讓事情更糟糕
Well, you may want to rethink that.Our presence here could make things worse.

600
00:54:14,680 --> 00:54:15,796
為什麼？
Why?

601
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:17,314
因為我們是個威脅
Because we're a threat.

602
00:54:17,520 --> 00:54:20,399
這裏這傢伙不太會喜歡我們
And whatever you're dealing with here isn't gonna like us.

603
00:54:20,560 --> 00:54:24,110
目前為止它還沒施過暴，這是個好現象
So far it hasn't done anything violent,and that's a good sign.

604
00:54:24,320 --> 00:54:27,199
所以我們會讓我們的人調查一下這裏…
So we're gonna have our guy do some homework on the property...

605
00:54:27,360 --> 00:54:29,158
…看看我們要對付的是什麼東西
...to see what we're up against.

606
00:54:31,400 --> 00:54:33,198
朱蒂，你要幹嗎？
Judy, what are you up to?

607
00:54:33,360 --> 00:54:36,114
我有禮物給你
I got you a present.

608
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:39,352
我跟外婆在教堂的庭院市場上買的
Me and Nanna got these at the church's yard sale.

609
00:54:39,520 --> 00:54:41,352
寶貝  - 一個給你，一個給我
Honey.  - One for you and one for me.

610
00:54:41,520 --> 00:54:43,079
她在我這個裏…
She put a picture...

611
00:54:43,240 --> 00:54:44,515
…放了你和爸爸的照片
...of you and Daddy in mine.

612
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:48,192
外婆說這樣我們就會永遠在一起
Nanna said this way we'll always be together.

613
00:54:48,360 --> 00:54:50,875
你我會一直在一起的
You'll be with me and I'll be with you.

614
00:54:53,560 --> 00:54:55,677
我想你和爸爸
I miss you and Daddy.

615
00:55:06,320 --> 00:55:07,436
嗨，親愛的
Hey, hon.

616
00:55:09,680 --> 00:55:10,716
在
Yup.

617
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:13,714
你不會相信的，卡洛琳的聲音沒錄下來
You're not gonna believe this.Carolyn's voice didn't record.

618
00:55:15,080 --> 00:55:16,116
什麼意思？
What do you mean?

619
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:18,275
聽著
Listen.

620
00:55:18,800 --> 00:55:22,237
我叫艾德·沃倫，今天是1971年11月1日
My name is Ed Warren.It's November 1st, 1971.

621
00:55:22,400 --> 00:55:24,232
現在跟卡洛琳·佩倫坐在一起…
I'm sitting here with Carolyn Perron...

622
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:27,837
…她的家庭正經歷著靈異事件
...who, with her family, has been experiencing supernatural occurrences.

623
00:55:28,200 --> 00:55:29,554
好，開始吧
Okay, go ahead.

624
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:34,598
從初次異常現象開始
From the first occurrence.

625
00:55:38,200 --> 00:55:39,475
什麼都沒有
Nothing.

626
00:55:40,080 --> 00:55:41,230
全程都是
The whole time.

627
00:55:41,440 --> 00:55:43,955
不知怎麼回事，發現什麼了嗎？  - 很多
I don't know. You find anything?  - Lots.

628
00:55:44,600 --> 00:55:47,559
我是說，怪不得他們會經歷這些
I mean, it's no wonder they're going through what they are.

629
00:55:47,840 --> 00:55:49,752
這是之前的農場房子
That's the original farmhouse.

630
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:52,992
是1863年一個名叫傑德森·佘曼的人建造的
It was built in 1863 by a man named Jedson Sherman...

631
00:55:53,240 --> 00:55:55,755
…他娶了一個名叫巴斯希巴的女人
...who was married to a woman named Bathsheba.

632
00:55:56,120 --> 00:55:59,192
艾德，她是瑪麗·湯·艾斯黛的親戚
Ed, she's related to Mary Towne Estye.

633
00:55:59,360 --> 00:56:01,511
是被指控在賽倫實施巫術行為的女巫之一
She was one of the women accused of witchcraft in Salem.

634
00:56:01,680 --> 00:56:03,592
被判了絞刑  - 哇噢
She was hung during the trials.  - Wow.

635
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:06,639
巴斯希巴嫁給傑德森之後，生了個孩子…
After Bathsheba married Jedson,they had a baby...

636
00:56:06,840 --> 00:56:08,638
…當孩子7歲的時候…
...and when the baby was 7 days old...

637
00:56:08,840 --> 00:56:11,719
…傑德森發現她在壁爐邊獻祭
...Jedson caught her sacrificing it in front of the fireplace.

638
00:56:11,880 --> 00:56:13,951
她跑到了碼頭那的樹邊…
She ran out to that tree by the dock...

639
00:56:14,120 --> 00:56:16,271
…爬了上去，表達了對撒旦的崇拜
...climbed up, proclaimed her love to Satan...

640
00:56:16,440 --> 00:56:20,320
…詛咒了每一個試圖奪走她土地的人，然後上吊自殺了
...cursed anyone who tried to take her land, and hung herself.

641
00:56:22,160 --> 00:56:25,756
宣稱的死亡時間是凌晨3:07
Time of death was pronounced at 3:07 in the morning.

642
00:56:26,120 --> 00:56:27,873
那一些事情就有解釋了
Well, that explains a few things.

643
00:56:28,040 --> 00:56:29,759
對，還有這個
Yeah, so does this.

644
00:56:30,680 --> 00:56:33,070
她姓沃克，30年代的時候住在那裏
Her last name's Walker.She lived there in the '30s.

645
00:56:33,280 --> 00:56:36,318
她有個叫羅利的孩子在樹林裏神秘失蹤了
She had a boy named Rory who ysteriously disappeared in the woods.

646
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:38,278
然後她在地下室自殺了
Then she killed herself in the cellar.

647
00:56:39,320 --> 00:56:40,356
這還不算完
And that's not all.

648
00:56:42,840 --> 00:56:47,710
自從原本200英畝的農場被分塊賣掉之後
So, what was the original 200-acre farm as since been subdivided and sold off.

649
00:56:47,920 --> 00:56:51,880
有個男孩在這個池塘裏淹死了，他住在這裏
There was another boy who drowned in pond here. He lived in a house over here.

650
00:56:52,040 --> 00:56:56,159
還有一個在附近做傭人的女人，也自殺了
And a woman who worked as a maid in a eighboring home, she committed suicide too.

651
00:56:58,080 --> 00:56:59,912
奪走她土地的人
People who took her land.

652
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:03,796
現在跟卡洛琳·佩倫坐在一起…
I'm sitting here with Carolyn Perron...

653
00:57:03,960 --> 00:57:07,158
…她的家庭正經歷著靈異事件
...who, with her family, has been xperiencing supernatural occurrences.

654
00:57:08,680 --> 00:57:10,080
好，開始吧
Okay, go ahead.

655
00:57:13,240 --> 00:57:15,357
從初次異常現象開始
From the first occurrence.

656
00:57:50,800 --> 00:57:52,029
布拉德來了
Here's Brad.

657
00:57:55,960 --> 00:57:57,440
路好找嗎？  - 是的
You find it okay?   - Oh, yeah.

658
00:57:57,600 --> 00:57:58,954
德魯，這是布拉德警官
Drew, this is Officer Brad.

659
00:57:59,160 --> 00:58:01,675
布拉德·漢密爾頓警官，羅德島哈瑞斯維爾警局的
Officer Brad Hamilton,Harrisville, Rhode Island P.D.

660
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:03,718
很高興見到你
Hm. Nice to meet you, man.

661
00:58:04,080 --> 00:58:07,710
你是那個幸運的新警察，是嗎？  - 應該是吧
So you're the lucky new cop, huh?  - Guess so.

662
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:11,038
鬼魂用槍是打不死的，知道嗎？  - 對他友好一點，德魯
You know you can't shoot ghosts, right?  - Take it easy on him, Drew.

663
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:13,431
好了，兄弟們，幫我把這些東西搬下車
All right, guys,help me get this stuff unloaded.

664
00:58:14,640 --> 00:58:16,074
你拿這個
You take this.

665
00:58:17,240 --> 00:58:18,390
嗨，羅傑
Hi, Roger.

666
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:27,910
這邊好了之後，再上樓去看看，好嗎，德魯？
All right. When you're finished here,why don't you hit upstairs, all right, Drew?

667
00:58:28,080 --> 00:58:29,275
知道了
You got it.

668
00:58:52,040 --> 00:58:53,679
這車哪裏壞了？
What's wrong with the Chevy?

669
00:58:54,280 --> 00:58:56,272
她還有哪裏是完好的嗎？
Ugh, what's not wrong with her?

670
00:58:56,440 --> 00:58:58,591
需要換個新化油器才能啟動  - 是嗎？
Needs a new carburetor to start.  - Oh, yeah?

671
00:58:58,800 --> 00:59:01,872
看來維修得停工一陣子了
Kind of put fixing her up on hold for a while.

672
00:59:02,040 --> 00:59:03,474
嗯，是啊
Yeah. Ahem.

673
00:59:05,440 --> 00:59:07,511
布拉德，把溫控器拿給我，好嗎？
Hey, Brad, hand me a thermostat,would you?

674
00:59:09,840 --> 00:59:12,150
這是幹什麼用的？
What's this, uh, do?

675
00:59:12,680 --> 00:59:14,478
當氣溫瞬間下降的時候…
When there's an instant drop in temperature...

676
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:17,075
…溫控器就會激發相機拍一張照片
...the thermostat triggers the camera to take a picture.

677
00:59:17,520 --> 00:59:19,557
你用這玩意兒拍到過東西嗎？
You've actually caught things on film?

678
00:59:19,960 --> 00:59:22,520
是的，這才是重點
Well, yeah, that's, uh, the point.

679
00:59:23,160 --> 00:59:26,232
為什麼…為什麼在這裏？
Why,uh...? Why out here?

680
00:59:26,440 --> 00:59:29,160
這是那女巫自殺的地方
Well, this is where the witch committed suicide.

681
00:59:29,800 --> 00:59:33,953
她在你頭頂的那根樹枝上吊死了
She hung herself from that branch right above where you're standing.

682
00:59:40,480 --> 00:59:42,312
為什麼母親會殺了她親生孩子？
How could a mother kill her own child?

683
00:59:43,040 --> 00:59:44,918
對她來說這並不是孩子
It was never a child to her.

684
00:59:45,080 --> 00:59:48,710
她只是把她當作工具來攻擊上帝
She just used her God-given gift as the ultimate offense against him.

685
00:59:48,880 --> 00:59:51,952
女巫們相信撒旦可以提升她們的能力
Witches believe it elevates their status in the eyes of Satan.

686
01:00:02,040 --> 01:00:05,511
那天在海灘玩得很開心，是吧？
Wow.That's a nice day at the beach, huh?

687
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:07,478
你怎麼知道的？
How did you know?

688
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:12,197
這是一種能力，就像是透過窗簾窺視別人的生活一樣
It's an insight. It's like a peek through the curtain into another person's life.

689
01:00:16,400 --> 01:00:20,440
那一天對我意義非凡，我們正沿著海岸開車
That day meant so much to me.We were driving along the coast.

690
01:00:20,600 --> 01:00:23,195
南希說那裏很漂亮
Nancy pointed out how pretty the view was.

691
01:00:23,800 --> 01:00:26,713
我想這是個拍照的好時機
I thought this is a perfect opportunity for a photo.

692
01:00:26,880 --> 01:00:30,032
我們正打算重新開始，新的房子，新的起點
We're gonna start fresh, you know?A new house, a new beginning.

693
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:33,557
你也見過羅傑跟姑娘們了，我從沒見他們那麼開心過
You should have seen Roger and the girls.I've never seen them so happy.

694
01:00:33,720 --> 01:00:34,870
茄子！
Cheese!

695
01:00:36,520 --> 01:00:38,637
他們對我來說就是一切
They mean the world to me.

696
01:00:49,240 --> 01:00:51,072
把你的手平放在桌子上
Put your hand flat on the desk.

697
01:00:52,560 --> 01:00:54,438
好，然後拿開
Yeah, and take it off.

698
01:00:56,960 --> 01:00:58,394
開始了
Here we go.

699
01:01:03,840 --> 01:01:04,876
看到了嗎？
See?

700
01:01:05,040 --> 01:01:07,396
這能讓我們看到那些肉眼看不到的東西
It just reveals to us what the naked eye can't see.

701
01:01:07,600 --> 01:01:09,080
高科技，是吧？
Pretty far out, isn't it?

702
01:01:09,960 --> 01:01:11,679
是啊，好神奇
Yeah, it's groovy.

703
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:19,557
德魯，布拉德的攝像機準備好了嗎？
Drew, you got the Bolex ready for Brad?

704
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:22,070
是的，一切就緒，先生
Yeah, already locked and loaded, sir.

705
01:01:39,680 --> 01:01:42,115
怎麼了？人有三急嘛
What? I had to go.

706
01:02:05,240 --> 01:02:07,800
所有房間信號正常
All the rooms are coming in pretty good.

707
01:02:07,960 --> 01:02:09,189
很好
Good.

708
01:02:14,640 --> 01:02:16,154
瓶子裏是什麼？
What's in the bottle?

709
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:17,996
聖水
Holy water.

710
01:02:20,240 --> 01:02:22,550
像這樣的宗教信物…
Presence of religious icons...

711
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:25,758
…會讓任何邪惡的東西起反應
...will get a reaction from anything unholy.

712
01:02:27,480 --> 01:02:29,199
類似於激怒他們
Sort of pisses them off.

713
01:02:30,520 --> 01:02:33,991
所以我滿屋子都放了這些，看能不能佔據點優勢
So I set these throughout the house,see if I can stir things up a bit.

714
01:02:36,880 --> 01:02:40,669
就像對著吸血鬼亮出十字架？  - 對，沒錯
Like holding a cross to a vampire?  - Yeah. Exactly.

715
01:02:41,040 --> 01:02:43,191
除了我不相信有吸血鬼之外
Except I don't believe in vampires.

716
01:02:48,280 --> 01:02:49,509
不是我
Wasn't me.

717
01:03:04,040 --> 01:03:05,520
布拉德，拿上攝像機
Brad, get the camera.

718
01:03:09,360 --> 01:03:10,430
好了
Okay.

719
01:03:16,720 --> 01:03:21,192
現在是晚上9:18，我們準備進入地下室，剛才那裏的門自己開了
All right, it's 9:18, we're headed down into the cellar where the door's just opened on its own.

720
01:03:21,400 --> 01:03:24,199
羅琳跟布拉德警官跟我一起
I have Lorraine and Officer Brad Hamilton with me.

721
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:26,557
地下室的燈保持關閉
Let's keep the cellar light off.

722
01:03:40,560 --> 01:03:43,394
如果想跟我們交流，就給我們點提示吧
Give us a sign that you wanna communicate with us.

723
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:13,434
親愛的，你還好嗎？
Hon, you all right?

724
01:04:17,800 --> 01:04:20,235
這裏肯定有什麼東西
There's definitely something here.

725
01:04:21,640 --> 01:04:24,758
關個門，移動點東西什麼的  - 我的手很冷
All right, close the door. Move something.  - My hands are so cold.

726
01:04:27,120 --> 01:04:28,315
來啊
Come on.

727
01:04:33,480 --> 01:04:34,630
不
No.

728
01:04:34,800 --> 01:04:36,439
它走了，它走了
It's gone. It's gone.

729
01:04:36,640 --> 01:04:38,120
我什麼都沒錄到
I got nothing.

730
01:04:38,440 --> 01:04:39,760
好的
Okay.

731
01:05:00,360 --> 01:05:03,797
就像我說的，並不是每次都能如願以償
Well, like I said, it doesn't always work when you want it to.

732
01:05:04,320 --> 01:05:06,755
是啊，也許攝像機拍到了點什麼
Yeah, maybe the camera picked something up.

733
01:05:07,560 --> 01:05:08,835
小心！
Watch out!

734
01:05:12,640 --> 01:05:14,154
作為無神論者…
For a guy who doesn't believe...

735
01:05:14,320 --> 01:05:17,677
…門摔上的時候你們好像嚇傻了嘛
...you looked a little freaked out when that door slammed shut.

736
01:05:20,560 --> 01:05:22,597
肯定是風
It must have been a draft.

737
01:05:23,080 --> 01:05:24,799
噢，滑稽
Oh, that's funny.

738
01:05:25,320 --> 01:05:27,915
風從來不會讓我出現那種表情
A draft never put that look on my face before.

739
01:05:30,600 --> 01:05:32,353
我更相信那鍾
I believe the clock.

740
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:35,593
3:08了
It's 3:08.

741
01:05:45,800 --> 01:05:47,359
給我看看你的眼鏡
Let me see your glasses.

742
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:48,716
給你的
For you.

743
01:05:48,920 --> 01:05:52,630
待會兒我想帶幾個女孩子去吃冰激淋，覺得怎麼樣？
I think I might take some girls for ice cream later on. What do you say about that?

744
01:05:52,840 --> 01:05:54,991
好的！  - 親愛的，一起嗎？
Yeah!  - Honey, you wanna come?

745
01:05:55,160 --> 01:05:58,198
我累死了，我要睡一會兒，好困
I'm exhausted. I'm just gonna take a nap.The late nights are getting to me.

746
01:05:58,360 --> 01:06:00,750
好主意，你休息一會兒吧
That's probably a good idea.Why don't you get some rest.

747
01:06:00,960 --> 01:06:03,555
羅琳和我會照看這裏  - 真的嗎？
Lorraine and I'll watch over things for a bit.  - Really?

748
01:06:03,720 --> 01:06:06,440
我要出發了，一小時後我有活
I'm gonna take off.I have a shift starting in an hour.

749
01:06:06,600 --> 01:06:08,751
這個家很久都沒有這樣了
The house hasn't felt like this in a long time.

750
01:06:08,960 --> 01:06:11,873
有你們在，孩子們有安全感多了
I think the kids feel a lot safer with you around.

751
01:06:15,440 --> 01:06:17,875
我會習慣起來的  - 什麼？我洗衣服？
I could get used to this.  - What, me doing laundry?

752
01:06:20,000 --> 01:06:21,832
你真幽默
You're funny.

753
01:06:22,480 --> 01:06:23,994
這地方…
No, this place.

754
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:26,471
漂亮，新鮮的鄉村空氣
Nice, fresh country air.

755
01:06:30,280 --> 01:06:32,840
他們有個很幸福的家，是吧？
They have such a beautiful family,don't they?

756
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:37,203
是啊，那小傢伙，艾普麗爾，有沒有看到她給我拿煎餅？
Yeah, that little one, April,did you see her bring me pancakes?

757
01:06:37,327 --> 01:06:37,884
是的
Yeah!

758
01:06:42,920 --> 01:06:44,513
我們得幫他們
We've gotta help them.

759
01:06:45,000 --> 01:06:46,400
我知道
I know.

760
01:06:47,600 --> 01:06:50,069
從修好那輛車開始
I'll start with the Chevy.

761
01:08:12,240 --> 01:08:13,515
卡洛琳！
Carolyn!

762
01:08:14,560 --> 01:08:15,596
你沒事吧？
Are you okay?

763
01:08:15,760 --> 01:08:16,910
卡洛琳，開門
Carolyn, open the door.

764
01:08:17,080 --> 01:08:18,150
卡洛琳，快開門！
Carolyn, open up!

765
01:08:25,160 --> 01:08:26,196
你沒事吧？
Are you okay?

766
01:08:26,360 --> 01:08:27,635
我沒事  - 你病了嗎？
Oh, I'm fine.  - Are you sick?

767
01:08:27,800 --> 01:08:30,634
我醒過來感覺有點想吐，僅此而已  - 我看到了…
I woke up feeling nauseous, that's all.  - I thought I saw...

768
01:08:30,800 --> 01:08:33,031
我聽到羅傑跟孩子們回來了
I hear Roger and the girls.

769
01:08:33,200 --> 01:08:34,270
稍等
One minute.

770
01:08:46,520 --> 01:08:48,637
姐妹們，想玩遊戲嗎？  - 無聊！
Guys, do you wanna play a game?  - Boring!

771
01:08:48,800 --> 01:08:49,916
謝謝，爸爸
Thank you, Daddy.

772
01:08:51,200 --> 01:08:52,350
我們進去吧
Let's go inside.

773
01:08:56,640 --> 01:08:57,790
就知道是你
I thought that was you.

774
01:08:58,000 --> 01:08:59,195
希望你不要介意
Hey, I hope you don't mind.

775
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:02,040
我在史密斯菲爾德的廢車場低價買了個拆車件
I got a good deal on a rebuild at that wrecking yard in Smithfield.

776
01:09:02,240 --> 01:09:05,278
不，你看起來很精通啊  - 是的，瞧我的
No, you look like you know what you're doing.  - Yeah, we'll see.

777
01:09:08,240 --> 01:09:09,879
這地方不錯，羅傑
Got a nice place here, Roger.

778
01:09:10,080 --> 01:09:12,390
羅琳跟我一直想在鄉下買套房子
Lorraine and I always wanted a spot in the country.

779
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:13,880
我把這裏賣給你吧
I'll sell you this one.

780
01:09:16,080 --> 01:09:17,594
把扳手遞給我
Hey, hand me a wrench, would you?

781
01:09:20,240 --> 01:09:24,678
嗨，你們能來這裏，真是感激不盡
Hey, uh, it really means a lot to us to have you here.

782
01:09:24,840 --> 01:09:27,912
我承認，之前我是有點不相信這些
I gotta admit, I was a little bit skeptical going in.

783
01:09:29,120 --> 01:09:32,272
就想說一聲謝謝，對於你們所做的一切
Just wanna say thank you, though,for coming out when you did.

784
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:37,676
我不能接受這份謝意，這都是羅琳的功勞
I can't take the credit.That's, uh... That's all Lorraine.

785
01:09:37,840 --> 01:09:40,594
我並不想這麼做  - 為什麼？
I didn't want to.  - Oh. Why's that?

786
01:09:43,920 --> 01:09:47,311
羅琳所看到的、感受到的、接觸到的，可以幫助別人
Whatever Lorraine sees, feels, touches,it helps people.

787
01:09:47,480 --> 01:09:49,597
但同時也會給她帶來傷害
But it also takes a toll on her.

788
01:09:49,840 --> 01:09:51,194
每次一點點
Little piece each time.

789
01:09:55,160 --> 01:09:57,880
幾個月前，我們正在處理一個案子
Couple months ago we were working on a case.

790
01:09:59,440 --> 01:10:01,159
她看到了一些東西
She saw something.

791
01:10:11,680 --> 01:10:13,194
造成了很大的傷害
It took a real big piece.

792
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:16,634
我們回家後…
When we got home...

793
01:10:16,840 --> 01:10:19,833
…她進了房間，把自己鎖在了裏面…
...she went into our room,locked herself in...

794
01:10:20,000 --> 01:10:22,834
…整整八天，不說，不吃，不出門
...didn't talk, didn't eat,didn't come out for eight days.

795
01:10:23,800 --> 01:10:25,120
她看到了什麼？
What'd she see?

796
01:10:28,080 --> 01:10:29,309
出去！
Get out of here!

797
01:10:30,400 --> 01:10:31,629
不知道
I don't know.

798
01:10:32,160 --> 01:10:33,799
我也不會問
And I won't ask.

799
01:10:51,400 --> 01:10:54,552
我要再去倒一杯，你要嗎？
I need to reload. You want some?

800
01:10:55,040 --> 01:10:56,554
不用，謝謝
I'm good, thanks.

801
01:10:57,400 --> 01:10:58,675
好吧
All right.

802
01:11:43,400 --> 01:11:45,232
看看她都讓我幹了些什麼
Look what she made me do.

803
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:31,230
看看她都讓我幹了些什麼
Look what she made me do.

804
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:35,275
嗨
Hey.

805
01:12:42,720 --> 01:12:43,756
艾德？
Ed?

806
01:12:43,960 --> 01:12:45,155
看看她都讓我幹了些什麼
Look what she made me do!

807
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:48,953
艾德！艾德！
Ed! Ed!

808
01:12:49,600 --> 01:12:50,829
艾德！
Ed!

809
01:12:51,960 --> 01:12:53,155
哥們兒，你還好嗎？
Dude, you okay?

810
01:12:53,320 --> 01:12:54,800
冷靜點，布拉德，怎麼了？
Hold up, Brad. What's going on?

811
01:12:54,960 --> 01:12:57,873
我看到了一個穿著傭人服的女人
I saw someone. There was a woman dressed as a maid.

812
01:13:01,560 --> 01:13:03,517
艾德？艾德，有情況
Ed? Ed, we're getting something.

813
01:13:08,800 --> 01:13:11,634
是辛蒂，她在夢遊  - 不，等等
It's just Cindy. She's sleepwalking.  - No, wait. We need this.

814
01:13:11,800 --> 01:13:13,359
為什麼要給辛蒂拍照？
Why do we need pictures of Cindy?

815
01:13:14,320 --> 01:13:15,834
不是她激發的
She didn't trigger it.

816
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:19,311
不是她激發的？什麼意思？  - 有人跟她在一起
What do you mean she didn't trigger it?  - Somebody's with her.

817
01:13:22,480 --> 01:13:23,630
誰？
Who?

818
01:13:27,560 --> 01:13:28,914
辛蒂！
Cindy!

819
01:13:32,640 --> 01:13:33,915
辛蒂！
Cindy!

820
01:13:40,680 --> 01:13:42,080
辛蒂！
Cindy!

821
01:13:42,240 --> 01:13:43,879
過來這裏，這裏安全
Hey, over here. It's safe.

822
01:13:44,040 --> 01:13:45,918
有人跟她在一起
There's someone else in there with her.

823
01:13:47,200 --> 01:13:49,510
我聽到了另一個聲音，這裏，聽
I'm hearing another voice. Here, listen.

824
01:13:54,320 --> 01:13:56,516
跟我來，這邊走
Follow me. This way.

825
01:13:58,000 --> 01:13:59,798
這就是我躲的地方
This is where I hide.

826
01:14:04,960 --> 01:14:06,189
辛蒂？
Cindy?

827
01:14:08,720 --> 01:14:10,040
辛蒂？
Cindy?

828
01:14:11,880 --> 01:14:13,030
她去哪裏了，艾德？
Where'd she go, Ed?

829
01:14:13,440 --> 01:14:15,033
窗子都鎖上了
Windows are locked.

830
01:14:18,080 --> 01:14:20,037
艾德，她去哪裏了？
Ed, where'd she go?

831
01:14:21,560 --> 01:14:22,914
布拉德，把紫外燈拿來
Brad, get the UV light.

832
01:14:23,080 --> 01:14:25,231
什麼？  - 問德魯
The what?  - Just ask Drew.

833
01:14:26,360 --> 01:14:29,159
德魯，我要個紫外燈
Drew, I need a UV light.

834
01:14:29,320 --> 01:14:30,834
給，就這個，快去，快去！
Here, that's it. Go, go, go, go!

835
01:14:37,400 --> 01:14:38,914
關燈
Turn off the light.

836
01:14:42,560 --> 01:14:44,119
讓開
Get out of the way.

837
01:14:47,280 --> 01:14:48,396
好的
Okay.

838
01:15:17,680 --> 01:15:19,194
開燈！
Hit the lights!

839
01:15:31,280 --> 01:15:32,760
找到她了
Found her.

840
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:35,436
過來吧
Here we go.

841
01:15:36,040 --> 01:15:38,271
抱好了？  - 是的
All right. You got her?  - Yeah.

842
01:15:50,000 --> 01:15:53,038
那就是羅利害怕的時候躲的地方
That's where Rory hides when he's afraid.

843
01:16:18,840 --> 01:16:21,753
親愛的？把艾普麗爾的音樂盒給我
Hon? Could I have April's music box, please?

844
01:16:24,840 --> 01:16:27,560
辛蒂怎麼樣？  - 她什麼都不記得
How's Cindy?  - She doesn't remember a thing.

845
01:16:30,520 --> 01:16:31,840
給你
Here you go.

846
01:16:32,600 --> 01:16:33,875
謝謝
Thank you.

847
01:17:11,520 --> 01:17:12,874
羅琳！
Lorraine!

848
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:18,189
不
No.

849
01:17:31,080 --> 01:17:32,309
羅琳！
Lorraine!

850
01:17:32,560 --> 01:17:33,789
羅琳！
Lorraine!

851
01:17:38,160 --> 01:17:39,560
羅琳！
Lorraine!

852
01:17:40,360 --> 01:17:41,760
羅琳！
Lorraine!

853
01:18:32,920 --> 01:18:35,640
是她讓我這麼做的
She made me do it.

854
01:18:36,720 --> 01:18:39,280
是她讓我這麼做的
She made me do it.

855
01:19:00,960 --> 01:19:03,600
是她讓我這麼做的
She made me do it.

856
01:19:47,320 --> 01:19:48,356
艾德！
Ed!

857
01:19:48,560 --> 01:19:50,358
拜託！羅琳！
Come on! Lorraine!

858
01:19:58,200 --> 01:19:59,316
艾德！
Ed!

859
01:20:00,200 --> 01:20:01,873
艾德，我知道她做了什麼
Ed, I know what she did.

860
01:20:02,080 --> 01:20:04,640
我扶你，我知道，沒事了  - 我知道她做了什麼
I got you. I know. It's okay.  - I know what she did.

861
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:07,713
我知道她做了什麼，她附身在那媽媽身上殺了那孩子
I know what she did. She possessed the mother to kill the child.

862
01:20:07,880 --> 01:20:09,394
她每晚都會去卡洛琳那裏
She visits Carolyn every night.

863
01:20:09,560 --> 01:20:12,394
所以才會有那些淤青！她在吸食她！
That's what the bruise marks are!She's feeding off of her!

864
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:27,079
呃…
Uh....

865
01:20:27,320 --> 01:20:28,754
南希？
Nancy?

866
01:20:33,240 --> 01:20:34,469
南希！
Nancy!

867
01:20:34,880 --> 01:20:36,155
你沒事吧？
Are you okay?

868
01:20:36,760 --> 01:20:38,080
南希！
Nancy!

869
01:20:39,600 --> 01:20:40,636
抓住她！
Grab her!

870
01:20:43,160 --> 01:20:44,719
爸爸！救命！
Daddy! Help!

871
01:20:45,600 --> 01:20:46,670
南希！
Nancy!

872
01:20:53,920 --> 01:20:54,990
她還好嗎？
Is she okay?

873
01:20:55,200 --> 01:20:56,395
沒事了，沒事了
It's okay, I got you.

874
01:20:56,560 --> 01:20:57,596
拍到了嗎？
Did you get that?

875
01:20:59,880 --> 01:21:01,075
是的
Yeah.

876
01:21:04,240 --> 01:21:07,233
我去沖印膠片，然後拿給哥頓神父
I'll have the footage developed and get it over to Father Gordon.

877
01:21:07,400 --> 01:21:11,394
他是我們教堂方面的聯絡人，我們會很快得到回應的
He's our liaison at the church.I imagine we'll get a pretty fast response.

878
01:21:11,560 --> 01:21:13,597
聽著，羅傑？  - 什麼？
Listen, Roger?  - Yeah?

879
01:21:13,800 --> 01:21:16,952
聽著，我們接到驅魔人就會回來，但羅琳…
Listen, when we get the exorcist,I'll be back. But Lorraine--

880
01:21:17,120 --> 01:21:20,192
是的，我明白  - 在這之前，德魯會照看你們的
Yeah, I understand.  - Until then Drew's gonna keep an eye on you.

881
01:21:20,360 --> 01:21:22,716
艾德，感謝你所做的一切  - 嗯
Hey, Ed, thank you for everything.  - Yeah.

882
01:21:24,160 --> 01:21:25,435
媽咪？
Mommy?

883
01:21:27,760 --> 01:21:29,399
就這些了
That's everything.

884
01:21:41,320 --> 01:21:42,674
媽咪？
Mommy?

885
01:22:01,000 --> 01:22:02,116
朱蒂？
Judy?

886
01:22:02,440 --> 01:22:03,794
噢，上帝啊！
Oh, God!

887
01:22:03,960 --> 01:22:05,076
朱蒂？
Judy?

888
01:22:13,760 --> 01:22:15,672
羅琳！等等！
Lorraine! Wait!

889
01:22:17,280 --> 01:22:18,794
羅琳，怎麼了？
Lorraine. What?

890
01:22:18,960 --> 01:22:20,314
媽媽，是我，朱蒂還好嗎？
Mom, it's me. Is Judy okay?

891
01:22:20,480 --> 01:22:22,949
什麼？  - 可以去看一下嗎？
What?  - Can you go check, please?

892
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:25,193
該死的，媽媽，去看一下就是了！
Damn it, Mom, just check, please!

893
01:22:25,360 --> 01:22:28,194
可以告訴我到底怎麼了嗎？  - 是朱蒂
Are you gonna tell me what's going on?  - It's Judy.

894
01:22:28,360 --> 01:22:29,874
什麼？什麼意思？
What? What do you mean?

895
01:22:30,880 --> 01:22:31,996
什麼意思？
What?

896
01:22:33,360 --> 01:22:35,511
噢，謝天謝地
Oh, thank God.

897
01:22:36,160 --> 01:22:39,358
媽媽，對不起，我不是有意要嚇你的，回頭再跟你解釋
Mom, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to scare you. I'll explain later, okay?

898
01:22:41,000 --> 01:22:42,320
這他媽到底怎麼回事？
What the hell happened?

899
01:22:42,480 --> 01:22:45,951
我看到朱蒂在湖裏
I had a vision of Judy in the water.

900
01:22:46,120 --> 01:22:48,396
我知道這是某種警告
I know it was some kind of warning.

901
01:22:49,640 --> 01:22:51,120
我知道的
I know it.

902
01:22:51,280 --> 01:22:52,509
好了
Okay.

903
01:22:54,560 --> 01:22:55,880
我們走吧
Let's get out of here.

904
01:23:43,880 --> 01:23:46,349
然後？  - 嗯，你們不是開玩笑
So?  - Yeah, well, you weren't kidding.

905
01:23:46,520 --> 01:23:47,590
是的
No.

906
01:23:48,400 --> 01:23:52,553
艾德，這事有點複雜，因為那些孩子們沒有經過洗禮
Look, Ed, this is complicated because the kids aren't baptized.

907
01:23:52,720 --> 01:23:55,952
是的，我理解  - 那家人也不是教會成員
No, I understand.  - And the family are not members of the church.

908
01:23:56,120 --> 01:23:57,440
噢，拜託  - 還有…
Oh, come on.  - And....

909
01:23:58,280 --> 01:24:01,751
許可令必須由梵蒂岡直接下發
The approval would have to come directly from the Vatican.

910
01:24:03,120 --> 01:24:06,033
神父，我們從沒見過這樣的東西
Father, we've never seen nothing like this.

911
01:24:09,920 --> 01:24:12,640
是的，我也沒見過
Yeah, well, neither have l.

912
01:24:21,360 --> 01:24:23,238
神父，他們沒那麼多時間了
Father, they don't have a lot of time.

913
01:24:23,840 --> 01:24:25,069
好吧
All right.

914
01:24:26,560 --> 01:24:28,153
我會親自跟進這事的
I'll push it through myself.

915
01:24:28,320 --> 01:24:30,277
謝謝，神父，謝謝  - 謝謝
Thank you, Father. Thank you.  - Thank you.

916
01:24:30,840 --> 01:24:33,753
我們等你電話  - 好的
All right, we'll wait for your call.  - Yeah.

917
01:25:37,560 --> 01:25:39,711
媽媽？爸爸？

外婆，救命！外婆，救命！

925
01:27:45,000 --> 01:27:46,036
朱蒂？

01:27:46,200 --> 01:27:50,558
外婆！
Nanna!

927
01:27:51,040 --> 01:27:52,315
救命！

928
01:27:52,760 --> 01:27:54,353
朱蒂！  - 外婆！

929
01:27:54,560 --> 01:27:56,358
朱蒂，開門！  - 媽媽！
Judy, open the door!  - Mom!

930
01:27:58,360 --> 01:28:00,352
艾德，有點不對勁  - 什麼？
Ed, there's something wrong.  - What?

931
01:28:03,560 --> 01:28:04,630
外婆！
Nanna!

932
01:28:05,200 --> 01:28:06,873
朱蒂！  - 救命！
Judy!  - Help!

933
01:28:07,040 --> 01:28:09,191
朱蒂！朱蒂，開門！  - 怎麼了？
Judy! Judy, open this door!  - What is it?

934
01:28:09,360 --> 01:28:12,478
她怎麼了？朱蒂！  - 讓開，讓開，讓開，讓開
What's wrong with her? Judy!  - Hey, move. Move, move, move, move.

935
01:28:12,680 --> 01:28:14,273
朱蒂，退後，寶貝，退後

拜託！  - 快點

離門遠一點，朱蒂！
Get away from the door, Judy!

939
01:28:26,120 --> 01:28:27,793
噢，上帝！你沒事吧？
Oh, God! Are you okay?

940
01:28:27,960 --> 01:28:32,034
有個人在跟安娜貝爾一起搖椅子
There was someone rocking in the chair with Annabelle.

941
01:28:35,120 --> 01:28:36,236
什麼？
What?

沒事了，沒事了
It's okay. It's okay.

946
01:29:14,280 --> 01:29:16,670
爸爸！爸爸！  - 爸爸！

947
01:29:16,840 --> 01:29:19,196
爸爸！爸爸！媽媽帶著克裏斯蒂和艾普麗爾走了
Dad! Dad! Mom just left with Christine and April.

948
01:29:19,360 --> 01:29:21,795
她進了車子然後開走了，我不知道發生了什麼事
She went in the car and drove away.I don't know what happened.

949
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,515
她聞起來有股爛肉味道  - 她沒說到底是怎麼了
She smells like rotting meat.  - She didn't say what was going on.

950
01:29:24,680 --> 01:29:28,276
她走了是什麼意思？走去哪了？  - 就是走了！不知道去哪裏了
What do you mean, she left? Left where?  - Gone! I don't know where she was going.

951
01:29:33,640 --> 01:29:35,359
我們去哪，媽媽？
Where are we going, Mom?

952
01:29:43,960 --> 01:29:45,235
喂？  - 我是羅傑
Hello?  - It's Roger.

953
01:29:45,440 --> 01:29:46,760
有事發生在卡洛琳身上了
Something's going on with Carolyn.

954
01:29:46,960 --> 01:29:49,794
安德莉亞在，她說卡洛琳帶著克裏斯蒂和艾普麗爾走了
Andrea was here,said Carolyn took off with Christine and April.

955
01:29:49,960 --> 01:29:52,714
孩子們說她聞起來像塊爛肉  - 附身於母親…
The girls said she smelled like rotten meat.  - Possesses the mother...

956
01:29:52,880 --> 01:29:55,634
…來殺掉孩子，她就是這麼做的，她要把她們帶去那房子
...to kill the child, that's what she does.She's taking them to the house.

957
01:29:55,800 --> 01:29:57,632
羅傑，現在去房子裏，我在那跟你碰頭
Roger, get back to the house now.I'll meet you there.

958
01:29:57,800 --> 01:30:01,237
鎖上門，拉上窗簾，遠離電話

01:30:08,960 --> 01:30:10,713
我跟你一起去  - 不行，你陪著朱蒂
I'm coming with you.  - Noway, you stay with Judy.

961
01:30:10,920 --> 01:30:13,310
保護朱蒂的唯一辦法就是終結這一切
Only way to protect Judy is if we stop this where it started.

962
01:30:13,480 --> 01:30:16,598
否則她會再次纏上我們  - 這正是我要去做的
Otherwise, she'll latch onto us again.  - That's exactly why I am going.

963
01:30:16,800 --> 01:30:19,395
你覺得我會讓你一個人去嗎？
You think I'm gonna let you walk into this alone?

964
01:30:20,080 --> 01:30:21,400
我不能失去你
I can't lose you.

965
01:30:22,000 --> 01:30:23,229
你不會的
You won't.

966

我們一起把這事終結吧

鎖上了  - 卡洛琳！

讓開！
Get out of the way!

970
01:30:56,720 --> 01:30:58,359
羅傑！  - 艾德！
Roger!  - Ed!

971
01:30:58,520 --> 01:31:00,113
卡洛琳！  - 艾德！

01:31:01,280 --> 01:31:02,555
卡洛琳！  - 我們在這裏！

973
01:31:02,720 --> 01:31:05,554
卡洛琳，不要！不，不！她抓著…！

抓住她手！把剪刀奪下來！

We gotta get her to the car!  - And bring her where?

976
01:31:21,640 --> 01:31:23,597
把她帶到神父那裏驅魔
To take her to the priest for the exorcism.

977
01:31:23,800 --> 01:31:25,154
艾普麗爾在哪？  - 艾普麗爾？
Where's April?  - April?

978
01:31:27,520 --> 01:31:28,795
艾普麗爾！

把克裏斯蒂帶上車，把艾普麗爾找出來！
Take Christine to the car and find April!

980
01:31:31,880 --> 01:31:32,916

趕緊！
Come on!

982
01:31:45,680 --> 01:31:47,751
她不讓她離開這房子  - 什麼意思？
She won't let her leave the house.  - What do you mean?

983
01:31:47,920 --> 01:31:50,310
如果把她帶出來，女巫會殺了她的
If we take her out, the witch will kill her.

984
01:31:56,920 --> 01:31:59,674
羅傑！

01:31:59,840 --> 01:32:01,194

988
01:32:09,200 --> 01:32:11,431
我把你放在這裏，來
Okay, I'm gonna put you in here.Come on.

989
01:32:11,600 --> 01:32:14,240
進去，呆裏面  - 我不想一個人在這裏
Get in. Stay in here.  - I don't wanna stay here by myself.

990
01:32:14,400 --> 01:32:16,198
呆在這裏，我很快回來
Stay in here no matter what.I'll be back.

991
01:32:16,360 --> 01:32:18,795
我要去找艾普麗爾，知道嗎？很快回來，我發誓
I have to find April, okay?I'll be back, I promise.

992
01:32:21,760 --> 01:32:22,910
艾普麗爾？

993
01:32:25,880 --> 01:32:27,109

找點什麼東西把她綁起來
Let's get something to tie her up!

01:33:02,080 --> 01:33:03,434
按住
Hold it.

998
01:33:14,240 --> 01:33:16,914
我得打電話把哥頓神父叫過來
I gotta call Father Gordon.We gotta get him out here.

999
01:33:17,080 --> 01:33:19,436
他離的太遠了，她撐不了那麼久，看看她
He's too far away.She won't make it. Look at her.

1000
01:33:30,080 --> 01:33:32,515
那你得離開了  - 你在說什麼？
Then you need to leave.  - What are you talking about?

1001
01:33:32,840 --> 01:33:34,797
我得進行驅魔儀式
I have to do it. The exorcism.

1002
01:33:35,280 --> 01:33:38,193
什麼？你不是說需要一個神父嗎，你又不是神父
What? I thought you said we need a priest. You're not a priest.

1003
01:33:38,400 --> 01:33:40,835
你有更好的主意？  - 他可以的
Well, you got a better idea?  - He can do it.

我不會離開你！  - 該死的，你不能在這裏！
I'm not leaving you!  - Damn it, I'm not doing this with you in here!

1006
01:33:49,720 --> 01:33:52,952
上帝把我們撮合在一起是有原因的，就這樣
God brought us together for a reason.This is it.

1007
01:33:53,920 --> 01:33:55,559
我去拿書
I'm gonna get the book.

1008
01:34:12,160 --> 01:34:13,514

"In the name of the Father,the Son, the Holy Spirit."

1011
01:35:28,800 --> 01:35:29,950
艾普麗爾！

1012
01:36:29,880 --> 01:36:31,951

01:36:32,120 --> 01:36:33,873
過來！按住她！

1014
01:36:42,720 --> 01:36:43,949
艾普麗爾？
April?

01:36:50,840 --> 01:36:51,876
艾普麗爾！
April!

1016
01:36:52,040 --> 01:36:53,599
艾普麗爾，你在下面嗎？

01:36:55,000 --> 01:36:56,070
艾普麗爾！
