把那个贱人带到我家里来

这些考试里总有些问题

不过如果你想把支票拿到手的话 
But you're gonna have to talk to somebody

625
00:50:05,869 --> 00:50:08,080
你总要跟什么人讲出来 宝贝儿

626
00:50:18,300 --> 00:50:20,340
我觉得他们就像吸血鬼
I see vampires, too.

627
00:50:23,180 --> 00:50:26,520
他们深夜才来 他们说我也是他们的一员
They come at night. They tell me I'm one of them.

628
00:50:27,890 --> 00:50:31,020
他们说 "阿珍 你是属于我们的"
They say, "Precious, you belong with us."

629
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:35,940
然后他们到楼上去
And then they go downstairs through the floor.

630
00:50:36,030 --> 00:50:38,860
住我们楼下的 也是吸血鬼
The people that live under us, they is vampires,

631
00:50:38,950 --> 00:50:41,790
我知道肯定没错

632
00:50:41,830 --> 00:50:43,990
他们真的很恶心
They be so nasty, though,

633
00:50:44,080 --> 00:50:46,450
到处脏掉的卫生棉条 在垃圾堆里面大便
leaving their dirty tampons and shit in the garbage.

634
00:50:46,540 --> 00:50:48,960
根本都懒得清理下
Don't even offer to take it out.

635
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:51,580
他们才没有任何家庭教养
They got no fucking home training.

636
00:50:54,630 --> 00:50:58,380
我也去看过医生了 挺好的
I been going to the doctor, too. it's nice.

雨小姐要是知道我第一次生孩子没有

去看过医生的话 肯定吓坏的

639
00:51:07,310 --> 00:51:09,690
她不知道我怎么把第一个孩子生在厨房地板上
Don't know how I had my first baby on the kitchen floor

640
00:51:09,770 --> 00:51:12,690
我妈还在后面踢我屁股

641
00:51:15,360 --> 00:51:16,730
还记得你一开始说的
Them the kind of things you're talking about

642
00:51:16,820 --> 00:51:19,650
一提到家我首先想到什么吗?

643
00:51:23,500 --> 00:51:27,039
就是这样 再见了 社会保障金
That's the end of them welfare checks.

我就是再也不想撒谎了 那些事我一句都不该说

之前从来没有人像这样握着我的手

我要把这一切都教给我的宝贝

653
00:53:09,003 --> 00:53:11,680
不用害怕 那时鬼扯 那是鬼扯
No fear. That's bullshit. That's bullshit. You mean, write a whole new one?

654
00:53:11,770 --> 00:53:14,640

No, girl, if I need to explain myself to you...

655
00:53:14,730 --> 00:53:16,480
- 你要搞明白 - 因为我蠢么?
- You'll figure it out. - You think that I'm stupid?

656
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:20,920
哦 天啊 我是不是应该相信你?

00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:24,950
是 不过我也不知道为什么
Yes, but I don't know what to do.

659
00:53:25,030 --> 00:53:28,630
好了 下一个是谁?

- This is a fairytale called "Enchanted." - She wrong about that. I is learning.

675
00:54:14,410 --> 00:54:17,870
很久很久以前 在一个很遥远的地方
Once upon a time, in a faraway land,

有一个漂亮的公主 叫做乔安...

除了一个白痴智障的蠢男人

我想念她 写一个童话故事的话...

01:10:47,610 --> 01:10:49,820
兰达 你想做老师啊
Rhonda, you ain't the teacher.

871
01:10:49,950 --> 01:10:52,280
乔安 雨小姐今天要忙阿珍的事
Joann, Ms. Rain is busy with Precious today,

872
01:10:52,370 --> 01:10:54,579
所以我就系老师 今天
so I am the teacher today.

873
01:10:54,580 --> 01:10:56,909
好吧 为啥?
Okay. Why?

874
01:10:56,910 --> 01:10:58,720
先坐吧
- Where's Precious? - Just sit. Pull out your notebook.

875
01:10:58,750 --> 01:11:01,170
乔安 你想看给宝宝唱Rap什么效果么?
Joann, you wanna say one of your raps to the baby?

876
01:11:01,250 --> 01:11:02,670
宝宝来这里干啥?
What's the baby doing here?

877
01:11:02,750 --> 01:11:04,460
- 乔安不懂咯 - 让我看看
- Joann's gonna rap for you. - let me see.

878
01:11:04,670 --> 01:11:06,970
她就是...
She all right. She's doing good.

879
01:11:07,680 --> 01:11:10,640
宝宝怎么被一个沾血的蓝毯子包着?
Why is the baby wrapped up in a blood covered blanket?

880
01:11:10,720 --> 01:11:11,950
乔安 有什么好笑的? 
Joann, what's so funny?

881
01:11:11,951 --> 01:11:13,559
不好笑! 但是到底发生什么了?
For real. What happened?

882
01:11:13,560 --> 01:11:14,970
你不会想知道的
You don't wanna know is how it got on the blanket.

883
01:11:15,060 --> 01:11:16,140
你知道你的问题所在么 乔安?
You know what your problem is, Joann?

884
01:11:16,230 --> 01:11:18,099
就是你无法严肃处事
That you can't take anything serious enough.

885
01:11:18,100 --> 01:11:20,520
- 我们又能期待你做出什么好事? - 好了 兰达
- Jermaine, me expect better from you. - Okay, Rhonda.

886
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:23,150
乔安 别再笑宝宝了
Joann, stop laughing at this baby.

887
01:11:24,820 --> 01:11:26,110
拜托了
Queens.

888
01:11:27,930 --> 01:11:30,200
等下再给你打回去
Let me call you back.

889
01:11:30,280 --> 01:11:31,570
那告诉我 到底发生什么了?
Just tell me what happened!

890
01:11:31,660 --> 01:11:32,990
- 这真的不好笑 - 宝宝被...
No, it's not funny.

891
01:11:33,080 --> 01:11:35,999
乔安 一个粘血的宝宝有什么好笑的
But Joann, there's nothing funny about a baby with blood on it.

892
01:11:36,000 --> 01:11:37,869
我认识一个人是一个议员
I got a West Indian friend who's a Council member.

893
01:11:37,870 --> 01:11:40,079
来看看他能不能帮上忙 稍等下
Let me see what she can do. Hold on a second.

894
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:43,380
我在我们的书里找到了一课...
I found a lesson plan in our notebooks. We're gonna...

895
01:11:44,920 --> 01:11:46,630
柯瑞丝·琼斯
Clarence Jones.

896
01:11:46,710 --> 01:11:49,010
嗨 露西小姐 最近好么?
Hey, Ms. Lisa. How you been?

897
01:11:49,840 --> 01:11:51,050
不太好
I don't know.

898
01:11:51,140 --> 01:11:56,050
昨天我去看电影《蝴蝶》了 就是砣屎
I went to see that movie, Barfly, last night. Piece of shit.

899
01:11:56,060 --> 01:11:59,180
- 就在我桌上 - 稍等一下好么
- I'm sorry. - it's on my desk. Can you hold?

900
01:11:59,270 --> 01:12:01,560
你有些不对劲了 阿珍
Something's wrong with you, Precious.

901
01:12:01,650 --> 01:12:03,190
宝宝身上都臭了
This baby stink.

902
01:12:03,270 --> 01:12:05,570
我们有没有尿布可换 抱着孩子坐下吧
Well, we don't have a Pamper, so have a seat with the baby.

903
01:12:05,650 --> 01:12:08,399
- 我就是坐着阿 - 请坐自己位置上
- I am sitting. - in your seat, please.

904
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:16,640
第一件事...
The first thing is shut the bumba.. ros... clot...

905
01:12:17,120 --> 01:12:19,709
雨小姐? 你为什么让兰达教课
Ms. Rain, why did you let Rhonda teach the class?

906
01:12:19,710 --> 01:12:21,330
她自己英语都说不好
She don't even know how to speak English.

907
01:12:21,420 --> 01:12:22,460
就让兰达先管吧
Let Rhonda take over.

908
01:12:22,540 --> 01:12:26,249
他妈的什么是"ros clot"
Shut the bumba ros clot up. What the fuck is a "ros clot"?

909
01:12:26,250 --> 01:12:30,840
是 布兰迪 还在么? 社保号的最后四位?
Yeah, Brenda, you there? The last four of the Social are...

910
01:12:30,920 --> 01:12:33,510
2 4 2 1
2- 4 2- 1 .

911
01:12:33,590 --> 01:12:35,720
- 丽塔 - 我就是想知道
- Rita? - I just wanna know how to spell "Aquarius."

912
01:12:35,800 --> 01:12:38,321
有人知道"Aquarius（宝瓶座）"怎么拼? 
Anybody know how to spell "Aquarius"?

913
01:12:38,322 --> 01:12:39,970
那你会不会拼"boy（男孩）"
it's A- Q- U- A- R- l- U- S. A- Q- U- A- R- I- U- S Can you spell "boy" then?

914
01:12:40,060 --> 01:12:41,389
那你会不会拼 "slut(贱人)"呐
Can you spell "slut" then?

915
01:12:41,390 --> 01:12:43,020
咱们一个一个来
Let's explore that.

916
01:12:43,100 --> 01:12:46,440
想拼出 婊子坎翠拉 我先给你们第一个字母
You wanna spell "slut," Consuelo, I'll give you the first letter.

917
01:12:46,520 --> 01:12:48,650
那你会不会拼"非法移民"呢?
Can you spell "illegal immigrant," then?

918
01:12:48,730 --> 01:12:50,780
太好了 谢谢你
Great, thank you.

919
01:12:52,360 --> 01:12:54,860
你能用 "sult" 造句吗?
Can you please use "slut" in a sentence?

920
01:12:54,950 --> 01:12:56,320
坎翠拉是个贱人
Consuelo is a slut...

921
01:12:56,410 --> 01:12:59,289
- 你才是在用XX的人好不好 - 乔安不是婊子
- You the one who's the ho up in here... - Joann is not a slut.

922
01:12:59,290 --> 01:13:01,660
棒极了
Perfect. You get a gold star.

923
01:13:03,500 --> 01:13:05,210
但是她知道她喜欢那样
But you know she likes that.

924
01:13:05,290 --> 01:13:07,590
她就是没有安全感罢了
Well, she's just insecure.

925
01:13:07,670 --> 01:13:09,300
- 你这样认为? - 没错
- You think? - Yeah.

926
01:13:09,800 --> 01:13:15,390
- 但是挺好的 - 是挺好 你吃饱了么? - 恩
- That chicken was good. - Really good. Did you have enough? There ain't more, is there?

927
01:13:15,470 --> 01:13:17,140
- 还有么? - 有阿
- is there more? - Yeah.

928
01:13:17,470 --> 01:13:19,760
也许等一会儿吧 现在先不
Maybe later. Not now.

929
01:13:19,850 --> 01:13:21,810
我不想让你觉得我很贪婪
I don't want you to think I'm greedy.

930
01:13:21,890 --> 01:13:24,230
你一点也不贪婪 你要是还饿 就多吃点呗
You're not greedy. lf you're hungry, let's get you some more.

931
01:13:24,310 --> 01:13:27,480
我想我该减下一点体重了
I guess I kind of eat too much sometimes, though.

932
01:13:27,560 --> 01:13:28,820
不 没必要
No, you don't.

933
01:13:28,900 --> 01:13:30,780
是你来了么?
- Blue, is that you? - Not always.

934
01:13:30,860 --> 01:13:32,940
你在这里干什么?
What are you doing here?

935
01:13:33,400 --> 01:13:36,159
我住在这儿呗 你怎么不告诉我?
I live here. Why didn't you tell me?

936
01:13:36,160 --> 01:13:39,990
- 宝贝儿 - 这位是...?
- Hey, sweetie. - is this... is this...

937
01:13:40,540 --> 01:13:42,750
这位是卡瑟琳 阿珍
This is Katherine, Precious.

938
01:13:42,830 --> 01:13:44,959
- 你还好么? - 终于见到你了真高兴
- Are you okay? - it's so nice to meet you, finally.

939
01:13:44,960 --> 01:13:48,380
哦 我的天 她们原来是女同性恋
Oh, my God. These straight- up lesbians.

940
01:13:48,460 --> 01:13:52,050
- 这位是阿杜 - 太漂亮了 他看上去就像你一样
- This is Abdul. - He's gorgeous. He looks just like you.

941
01:13:53,090 --> 01:13:56,260
- 阿珍 我能抱抱么? - 你知道怎么抱么?
- Precious, can I hold him? - You know how to?

942
01:13:56,340 --> 01:13:58,340
但她们是那么好心 让我在找到安定的地方前
They still nice enough to let us stay in their home

943
01:13:58,430 --> 01:14:00,760
住在她们家里
until I get situated, though.

944
01:14:00,850 --> 01:14:04,930
- 还挺沉! 我的天 - 真是...
- He's heavy. Oh, my God! - You wanna hold him?

945
01:14:05,020 --> 01:14:07,520
我猜这就是电视中的那些人 过圣诞节时的感觉吧
I guess this is how the peoples on TV feel at Christmastime.

946
01:14:07,600 --> 01:14:10,190
- 别掉了 - 哦 拜托 我对小孩儿当然小心了
- Don't drop him. - Come on. I only work with children.

947
01:14:10,270 --> 01:14:11,320
我还记得
You know how you are. I saw you...

948
01:14:11,400 --> 01:14:13,440
你装饰圣诞树的时候 什么都掉地上
When we were putting up the tree, you dropped half the top of it.

949
01:14:13,530 --> 01:14:15,199
她们对我和阿杜那么的好
They're so nice to me and Abdul.

950
01:14:15,200 --> 01:14:17,359
小心点 两只手都用上
- Be careful. Hold him with both hands. - Please.

951
01:14:17,360 --> 01:14:19,800
小阿杜
Oh, Abdul.

952
01:14:21,030 --> 01:14:23,200
圣诞快乐 阿珍
Merry Christmas, Precious.

953
01:14:24,040 --> 01:14:25,160
谢谢你
Thank you.

954
01:14:25,250 --> 01:14:26,580
为什么几乎不认识我的人
Why peoples that barely know me

955
01:14:26,670 --> 01:14:30,000
待我都比我爸爸我妈妈要好?
should be nicer to me than my mother and my father?

956
01:14:30,630 --> 01:14:32,040
- 我感觉到温暖 - 你把猫关起来了么?
- I felt warm.

957
01:14:32,380 --> 01:14:33,590
- 什么?! - 我就是...
- What? - I'm just...

958
01:14:33,670 --> 01:14:36,929
我就是担心宝宝 猫还在楼上
I'm just concerned about the baby and the cats upstairs.

959
01:14:36,930 --> 01:14:38,090
- 没事的 - 好吧
- They're fine. - OK

960
01:14:38,180 --> 01:14:40,180
奶奶害怕妈妈
Grandmother's scared of Momma.

961
01:14:40,260 --> 01:14:42,680
这知道这就是她不让我和她住一起的原因
I know that's why she ain't Letting me stay with her.

962
01:14:42,760 --> 01:14:44,680
如果麦当劳...
lf Ronald McDonald were running things...

963
01:14:44,770 --> 01:14:47,209
雨小姐说什么都不要怕
Ms. Rain say don't be afraid of nothing.

964
01:14:48,230 --> 01:14:50,710
我打赌她不会害怕我妈妈
I bet she ain't scared of Momma.

965
01:14:50,770 --> 01:14:53,400
难道你不会心生疑惑么?
Wouldn't you be a little bit suspicious?

966
01:14:53,480 --> 01:14:54,730
那你写成书吧
Just write the book.

967
01:14:54,820 --> 01:14:58,159
- 那谁来看呢? - 你不写也没人看啊
- Well, who's gonna read it? - Nobody, if you don't write it.

968
01:14:58,160 --> 01:15:01,700
知道么 阿珍天天都写作
You know, Precious writes every day. You should try it.

969
01:15:01,780 --> 01:15:05,820
是么? 你都写些什么呢 阿珍?
is that right? What do you write about, Precious?

970
01:15:05,830 --> 01:15:07,080
就是
Stuff.

971
01:15:08,170 --> 01:15:10,580
我的生活 阿杜...
My life. Abdul.

972
01:15:13,000 --> 01:15:15,170
你们怎么会都不喜欢麦当劳呢?
How come y'all don't like McDonald's?

973
01:15:15,260 --> 01:15:17,090
卡瑟琳只是做些比较...
Katherine was just drawing a comparison

974
01:15:17,220 --> 01:15:20,340
这样她的观点可以更容易被理解...
so that her point could be more easily understood. Yes.

975
01:15:20,430 --> 01:15:22,930
她们说话就像我不看的电视频道
They talk Like TV channels I don't watch.

976
01:15:23,010 --> 01:15:24,390
- 谁会看呢? - 比如 克力顿大叔
My Uncle Clayton.

977
01:15:24,470 --> 01:15:27,114
我很高兴阿杜也能听着 
I'm glad Abdul here to Listen in on them, though, 

978
01:15:27,115 --> 01:15:29,519
因为我知道她们很聪明
'cause I know they're smart. Before he got saved,

979
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:32,269
他吸起烟来就像个烟囱 喝起酒来像条鱼
he used to smoke like a chimney and drink like a fish.

980
01:15:32,270 --> 01:15:34,399
她们说的我一个字都听不懂
I don't understand a word they're saying.

981
01:15:34,400 --> 01:15:35,980
明白么?
You understand?

982
01:15:39,570 --> 01:15:41,030
你们都看歌剧么?
Y'all be watching Oprah?

983
01:15:41,110 --> 01:15:44,119
不 其实我不看 你知道我下班回家都几点了?
No. I don't, actually. You know what time I get home from work.

984
01:15:44,120 --> 01:15:47,039
- 我看 - 妈妈说同性恋都是坏人
- I watch it. - Momma say homos is bad peoples.

985
01:15:47,040 --> 01:15:47,959
那你应该写作啊
you should write

986
01:15:47,960 --> 01:15:50,459
但是妈妈 同性恋不是对我暴力的人
But Momma, homos not ones who raped me.

987
01:15:50,460 --> 01:15:52,750
为什么你是?
And what do that make you?

988
01:15:52,830 --> 01:15:56,960
同性恋让我学到了我在学校 那么多年没有学到的东西
Homos not ones who let me sit in class all them years and never Learn nothing.

989
01:15:57,050 --> 01:15:59,920
同性恋也不是黑人区卖毒品的那些
The homos not ones who sell crack to peoples in Harlem.

990
01:16:00,010 --> 01:16:02,089
- 我从没见过 告诉她!
- ...that I have ever seen. Tell her! - That doesn't work.

991
01:16:02,090 --> 01:16:04,759
歌剧里是怎样描述这些的?
I wonder what Oprah got to say about that.

992
01:16:04,760 --> 01:16:07,140
是雨小姐将粉笔递在我手中
Ms. Rain is the one who put the chalk in my hand,

993
01:16:07,220 --> 01:16:09,680
让我成为字母表的女王
made me queen of the ABC's.

994
01:16:12,650 --> 01:16:14,560
自从我在一间中转房落脚后
After I settled at the halfway house,

995
01:16:14,650 --> 01:16:17,070
我开始尽我的努力学习 记忆
I worked my hardest to memorize Letter sounds,

996
01:16:17,150 --> 01:16:20,150
写笔记 读各种书
writing in the journal, and reading smaller and fatter books.

997
01:16:20,280 --> 01:16:22,984
后来我发现 市长办公室... 
Then I found out the Mayor's office

998
01:16:22,985 --> 01:16:26,050
给我颁发了文明进步奖 还有奖金支票
give me a Literacy award and a check for progress.

999
01:16:27,740 --> 01:16:29,500
1, 2, 3.
One, two, three.

1000
01:16:29,580 --> 01:16:31,330
派对开始了
The party is on.

1001
01:16:31,620 --> 01:16:33,000
约翰

每个人都来了 护士约翰... 所有的工作人员都来了
Let me see what you got! Everybody come. Nurse John, Cornrows, all the staff was out there.

1003
01:16:44,090 --> 01:16:46,350
连卡瑟琳都来了
Even Ms. Katherine showed up.

1004
01:16:46,680 --> 01:16:47,970
阿珍!
Precious.

1005
01:16:51,180 --> 01:16:52,600
怎么了?
What's up?

1006
01:16:53,100 --> 01:16:54,600
让我看一下?
What's that?

1007
01:16:55,190 --> 01:16:56,860
这看上去像啥?
What does it look like?

1008
01:16:56,940 --> 01:16:58,860
就个塑料苹果呗
Plastic stupid apple.

1009
01:17:02,030 --> 01:17:03,700
给你点东西
A little something for you.

1010
01:17:03,780 --> 01:17:06,560
- 是给我的钱么? - 你怎么那么贪呢
- is there more money in it? - You're so greedy.

1011
01:17:06,580 --> 01:17:11,560
那个...那两位是谁?
Yo, who's that?

1012
01:17:12,250 --> 01:17:13,500
咋了?
What?

1013
01:17:16,380 --> 01:17:18,879
- 怎么啦?! - 过来!
- What? - Come on.

1014
01:17:18,880 --> 01:17:21,340
阿珍 你要带我去哪儿?
Precious, where are you taking me?

1015
01:17:22,760 --> 01:17:26,047
那我该怎么办 事儿妈? 没错 先等下
What am I supposed to do, diva? Yeah? Wait a minute.

1016
01:17:26,048 --> 01:17:28,970
先别挂 姑娘 什么事 阿...
Hold on, girl. Yeah...

1017
01:17:32,270 --> 01:17:34,390
我妈昨晚打电话给我
My mom called last night.

1018
01:17:37,060 --> 01:17:40,360
而...我们没怎么有来往
And we don't really have a relationship.

1019
01:17:40,820 --> 01:17:43,739
我们不谈话 她对我是...
We don't talk, because she really has a problem with...

1020
01:17:43,740 --> 01:17:47,490
有些人就像一盏明灯照亮周围的人
Some folks got a light around them that shine for other peoples.

1021
01:17:47,570 --> 01:17:50,660
有些人曾经就像生活在隧道里
I think maybe some of them was in tunnels,

1022
01:17:50,740 --> 01:17:53,450
而那隧道 唯一的光亮就是
and in that tunnel, maybe the only Light they had

1023
01:17:53,540 --> 01:17:55,080
内心的光亮
was inside of them.

1024
01:17:55,170 --> 01:17:58,420
我想过你要多坚强来承受这一切
Then I thought about how strong you've had to be.

1025
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:04,760
而然后 即使在逃离了隧道很久之后...
And then, even Long after they escaped that tunnel...

1026
01:18:06,090 --> 01:18:09,599
- 我来打扫 - 好吧
- I'll help you clean up. - Okay.

1027
01:18:09,600 --> 01:18:12,600
内心的光亮依然照耀着别人
...they still be shining for everybody else.

1028
01:18:16,810 --> 01:18:18,850
雨小姐对我来说就是这样
That's Ms. Rain to me.

1029
01:18:23,440 --> 01:18:27,070
在我读的这本书里 有一个女人逃到了中转房
In a book I read, this Lady escaped to a halfway house.

1030
01:18:27,160 --> 01:18:28,360
当她在那里时
And when she was there,

1031
01:18:28,450 --> 01:18:31,370
她问那里的人 中转房是什么意思
she asked the people there what a halfway house was.

1032
01:18:31,450 --> 01:18:35,790
他们告诉他 这就是你过去 的生活和你想要的生活的中转站
They told her it was halfway between her old life and where she wanna be.

1033
01:18:35,870 --> 01:18:37,790
感觉挺好的
That's kind of nice.

1034
01:18:39,460 --> 01:18:42,550
这也意味着我不能一辈子待在这里
That also mean I can't stay here forever.

1035
01:18:42,630 --> 01:18:44,800
还有很长的路要走
There's still a way to go.

1036
01:18:45,510 --> 01:18:48,470
要是我有了自己的公寓该多好
It'd be something to get my own apartment.

1037
01:18:49,300 --> 01:18:53,469
阿杜九个月大了 差不多能走路了 他也很聪明
Abdul nine months and almost walking. He's smart, too.

1038
01:18:53,470 --> 01:18:56,560
从他出生的那天起我就读书给他听
I've been reading to him since the day he was born.

1039
01:18:56,640 --> 01:18:59,690
他还不会说话 但他已经懂一些了
He's barely talking, but he's already counting.

1040
01:19:00,650 --> 01:19:02,480
妈妈 爸爸
Momma, Daddy,

1041
01:19:03,230 --> 01:19:07,650
林克斯大道444号的日子 在我看来已经是过去的噩梦了
444 Lenox all seem Like some old, bad dream.

1042
01:19:09,820 --> 01:19:13,830
我真希望一切是从这里开始 但还是和阿杜在一起
I wish I could've just started out here, but still with Abdul.

1043
01:19:15,250 --> 01:19:20,800
还有小芒果 我要把小芒果带回来
I'm gonna get Mongo, too. I gotta get Mongo back.

1044
01:19:21,500 --> 01:19:22,590
嗨 汤森夫人
Hey, Miss Cassidy.

1045
01:19:22,670 --> 01:19:24,880
嗨 阿珍 下面有人在等你
Hey, Precious, somebody downstairs for you.

1046
01:19:24,960 --> 01:19:26,799
- 是谁? - 我不知道是谁
- Who is it? - I didn't ask who it was.

1047
01:19:26,800 --> 01:19:28,010
用我帮你看孩子么?
You want me to watch the baby?

1048
01:19:28,090 --> 01:19:32,010
不用了 我正好也要下去
No, I gotta go down and get him anyway.

1049
01:20:05,380 --> 01:20:07,050
你爸死了
Your daddy dead.

1050
01:20:08,970 --> 01:20:10,420
就说这?
That's all?

1051
01:20:15,510 --> 01:20:17,390
他得了爱滋
He had that AlDS virus.

1052
01:20:31,210 --> 01:20:32,810
阿珍!
Precious

1053
01:20:34,240 --> 01:20:36,910
阿珍 你听到我跟你说话了么?
Precious, do you hear me talking to you?

1054
01:20:38,330 --> 01:20:39,450
你听到我说什么了么?
Did you hear what I said?

1055
01:20:44,420 --> 01:20:45,840
你得了么?
You got it?

1056
01:20:47,090 --> 01:20:48,710

- 艾滋病 - 没
- The AlDS virus. - No.

1058
01:20:51,760 --> 01:20:53,430
你怎么知道?
How do you know?

1059
01:20:53,510 --> 01:20:56,390
我们从没做过肛交的 所以我知道
We never did it up in the ass, so I know.

1060
01:21:00,770 --> 01:21:03,230
你最好去看看医生 妈
You better get to a doctor, Mom.

1061
01:21:05,940 --> 01:21:07,650
你回家不?
You coming home?

1062
01:21:24,620 --> 01:21:26,130
哟 阿珍!
Yo, Precious!

1063
01:21:44,770 --> 01:21:46,319
莉塔
Rita,

1064
01:21:46,320 --> 01:21:51,000
如果一个作者写一个人是
what do I mean when I say the author describes her protagonist's

1065
01:21:51,002 --> 01:21:53,420
不知天高地厚 是什么意思
circumstances as "unrelenting"?

1066
01:21:53,530 --> 01:21:55,860
我不知道 不知道
I don't know. I don't know.

1067
01:21:58,240 --> 01:22:01,909
比方说丽塔 朝一个方向走路
it's like, say, like if Rita, she tries to do something,

1068
01:22:01,910 --> 01:22:04,370
该停的时候 又接着走
and she's going and she's going, and me, I try to stop her

1069
01:22:04,460 --> 01:22:07,080
她不停 又接着走
and she no stop, she keep on going.

1070
01:22:07,710 --> 01:22:09,500
不管周围 那样
Relentless- un.

1071
01:23:02,220 --> 01:23:04,680
那稍后见 再见
I'll see you tonight. Bye.

来一下
Come with me.

1074
01:23:56,690 --> 01:23:58,110
阿珍?
Precious?

1075
01:23:59,950 --> 01:24:01,410
抱歉?
Excuse me?

1076

护士说我HIV阳性

01:24:12,080 --> 01:24:14,630
我今天什么都不想写

1078
01:24:16,460 --> 01:24:18,130
孩子们还好么?

01:24:19,170 --> 01:24:23,550
没事 只要我不用母乳喂他们的话
He all right. I just got to stop breastfeeding him.

1080
01:24:26,260 --> 01:24:28,430
还记得曾经有一次你告诉我...
Remember, you once told me

1081
01:24:28,930 --> 01:24:31,810
你还没有好好的和他讲过故事
you never really got to tell your story.

1082
01:24:33,270 --> 01:24:35,819
- 写下来 - 操你!
- Write. - Fuck you!

1083
01:24:35,820 --> 01:24:38,820
我所经历的你知道个屁!
You know nothing of what I've been through.

1084
01:24:39,990 --> 01:24:42,320
我从没有过男朋友
I don't never had no boyfriend.

1085
01:24:44,990 --> 01:24:47,580
我爸爸说他想娶我
My daddy said he gonna marry me.

1086
01:24:48,240 --> 01:24:51,540
为什么呢? 因为他想合法操我!

写

1088

我受够了 雨小姐
I'm tired, Ms. Rain.

1089
01:25:14,560 --> 01:25:17,730
如果不想为自己写 那为爱你的人写
lf not for yourself, then for the people who love you.

1090
01:25:17,820 --> 01:25:19,610
没人爱我
Nobody loves me.

1091
01:25:19,690 --> 01:25:21,940
人们爱你 阿珍

1092
01:25:22,400 --> 01:25:24,860
请你别骗我了 雨小姐
Please don't lie to me, Ms. Rain.

爱 打我 强奸我

称我为野兽 让我觉得自己一无是处 让我得病

1096
01:25:42,550 --> 01:25:44,630
那不是爱 阿珍
That wasn't love, Precious.

1097
01:25:46,720 --> 01:25:48,550
你的宝宝爱你
Your baby loves you.

1098
01:25:51,850 --> 01:25:53,310

你在想些什么呢?
What are you thinking?

1101

你从没跟我说过 你和你妈妈的关系
You never told me about your relationship with your mother.

1102
01:26:21,880 --> 01:26:23,950
我是没说过 是吧?
I didn't, did l?

1103
01:26:24,260 --> 01:26:26,840
真的 我来这里是帮助你

你可以和我谈 这里很安全
You can talk to me. This is a safe environment.

1105
01:26:31,430 --> 01:26:32,810
你说得没错
You're right.

1106
01:26:32,890 --> 01:26:35,430
要不然谈谈你爸爸也可以
We could talk about your daddy instead.

1107
01:26:35,520 --> 01:26:38,350
我们可以谈谈我妈妈 我爸爸 我姨妈...
We could talk about my mother, my father,

1108
01:26:38,440 --> 01:26:43,460
我姐姐和我哥哥 但这都不会帮到你
my aunts or my sister or my brother, but none of it's gonna help you.

1109
01:26:43,480 --> 01:26:44,990
你一点都不喜欢我
You don't even like me.

1110
01:26:45,070 --> 01:26:48,110
我们不是已经在这房间里
Have we not been in this room together

1111
01:26:48,200 --> 01:26:51,450
相处有一年时间 讨论你的生活么?
for, like, a year, discussing your life?

1112
01:26:51,530 --> 01:26:54,540
就是说讨论了我的生活 我们就可以互相喜欢了么?
Does that mean we like each other, because we discuss my life?

1113
01:26:54,620 --> 01:27:00,970
我不能替你说 我只能说我自己的想法 而我是喜欢你的
I can't speak for you. I can only speak for me, and I do like you. I do.

1114
01:27:01,290 --> 01:27:03,130

算是某种黑人还是西班牙人?
Are you some type of black or Spanish?

1117

你觉得我算什么人种呢?
What color do you think I am?

1118
01:27:10,930 --> 01:27:14,260
现在我挺想知道的 你觉得我是什么人种呢?
No, I'd like to know. What color do you think I am?

那么 我必须跟你谈谈你妈妈的事
So, I have to talk to you about your mother,

1128

我不知道你做何感想 但是
and I don't know how you're gonna feel about this,

1129
01:28:14,780 --> 01:28:17,619
她说她想看看你...
but she says she wants to see you

1130
01:28:17,620 --> 01:28:22,750
她想和你还有孙子重聚

她想来和你会面谈谈

1133
01:28:27,550 --> 01:28:30,380
我说我会转告给你的
I said I had to speak to you about it.

1134
01:28:33,010 --> 01:28:34,430
你来决定
it's up to you.

1135
01:28:34,510 --> 01:28:37,470
我不知道 我也从没有想过
I don't know. I never thought about it before.

1136
01:28:39,020 --> 01:28:41,520
怀斯小姐说没什么比的上HIV病毒
Ms. Weiss said in that flee I got HIV.

1137
01:28:41,600 --> 01:28:44,020
她说我会因此而死
She said I was supposed to die from it.

1138
01:28:44,110 --> 01:28:46,150
我不担心我死
I ain't worried about dying.

1139
01:28:46,230 --> 01:28:50,190
我担心怎样才能养大我的孩子
Shit, I gotta worry about how I'm supposed to raise these kids.

1140

就是有病或者之类的...
You know, just, if they're sick or something like that.

1144
01:29:03,750 --> 01:29:07,499
我总是想这么做 帮助邻里 因为我知道我妈妈
I always wanted to do that, give back to the community.

1145
01:29:07,500 --> 01:29:12,130
一定会为我感到骄傲 还有我的孩子也是
Because I know my mom would be proud of me if I did that, and my children, too.

1146
01:29:12,220 --> 01:29:15,930
我想我的孩子为妈妈感到骄傲 是吧?

好的... 救助中心去谈话的事
Okay, the counselors at Advancement House,

1150
01:29:36,370 --> 01:29:38,870
是因为我爸爸和妈妈 对吧?

1151
01:29:38,950 --> 01:29:40,700
其实不是关于他们的
But it's not really about them.

1154
01:29:45,420 --> 01:29:47,710
因为我在那儿偷了我的档案
Because I stole my file and I read it.

1155
01:29:47,790 --> 01:29:49,710
他们想让我做的就是工作
All they want me to do is work.

1156
01:29:49,800 --> 01:29:54,550
我是想要工作 但我不想要赚得不够养活自己的工作
Now, I do wanna work, but not for no welfare check. What kind of sense that make,

1157
01:29:54,630 --> 01:29:57,550
这样做到底意义何在? 像阿珍这样高中没毕业就被退学
for somebody like Precious to quit school before she got her GED

1158
01:29:57,640 --> 01:30:00,260
然后去不知道什么地方给白人老人干活?
and go work for some old white people somewhere?

1159
01:30:00,350 --> 01:30:03,430
她什么坏事也没做 没理由被害得被困在这上面
She ain't never gonna be nothing if she gets stuck in some shit like that.

1160
01:30:03,520 --> 01:30:05,020
兰达曾经当过陪护员
Rhonda used to home attend.

1161
01:30:05,100 --> 01:30:08,110
她去过布利莱顿海滩
She used to have to go all the way out to Brighton Beach.

1162
01:30:08,190 --> 01:30:11,530
好的 兰达曾经作陪护整天整夜
Yeah, okay, Rhonda would be working there all day and night.

1163
01:30:11,610 --> 01:30:13,650
随时摇铃呼唤 是吧?
She'd be on call, right?

1164
01:30:14,070 --> 01:30:18,780
赚时薪6.37美元 按照八小时工作制
She made $6.37 an hour, but for only eight hours.

1165
01:30:18,870 --> 01:30:21,890
所以一天是50.96美元
That equal out to $50.96.

1166
01:30:21,990 --> 01:30:23,410
但这可没多少钱
But that's not a whole lot of money,

1167
01:30:23,500 --> 01:30:26,620
因为事实 她工作24小时
especially 'cause, for real, she there for 24 hours.

1168
01:30:26,710 --> 01:30:30,850
所以... 50.96除以24 
So, $50.96 divided by 24 is $2.1 2 an hour.

1169
01:30:30,851 --> 01:30:35,509
那就是时薪2,06美元 这可没多少钱
That's not a lot of money.

1170
01:30:35,510 --> 01:30:39,890
她说那个老贱人会摇铃铛 货真价实的铃铛
She said that old bitch would ring a bell, like, a real life, actual bell

1171
01:30:39,970 --> 01:30:41,810
如果她半夜想要她干点啥
when she wanted something from her in the middle of the night.

1172
01:30:41,890 --> 01:30:44,679
- 谁想干那破事 - 兰达 是真的么 兰达?
- You don't want to do that shit. - Rhonda, is that true? Rhonda!

1173
01:30:44,680 --> 01:30:47,730
陪护员一天要工作6天
Them home attendants be working for, like, six days a week.

1174
01:30:47,810 --> 01:30:50,039
那我只能在周日见阿杜了 而且还不能上课了?
I'd only see Abdul on Sunday. Plus, I'd have to leave class.

1175
01:30:50,040 --> 01:30:55,399
那么 那不可行 你不能离开课堂
Well, that's not an option. You're not leaving class.

1176
01:30:55,400 --> 01:30:58,530
另外 下次还要去讨论"insect(虫子)"问题
Plus, I'm gonna start going to insect survivor meetings.

1177
01:30:58,610 --> 01:31:00,120
那是"incest"(乱伦)
it's "incest."

1178
01:31:01,870 --> 01:31:05,040
- 我不是那么说的么? - 不是 你说的是insect
- That ain't what I said? - No, you said "insect."

1179
01:31:05,620 --> 01:31:06,910
有啥区别?
What's the difference?

1180
01:31:07,000 --> 01:31:08,790
一个是指你家庭内问题
Well, one's where your family molests you,

1181
01:31:08,880 --> 01:31:11,540
另一个是指虫子 昆虫
the other's like a roach or bugs.

1182
01:31:14,210 --> 01:31:16,840
- 哦 你现在是科学家了? - 我就是说一下吗
- So, you a scientist now? - I'm just saying.

1183
01:31:16,920 --> 01:31:19,720
没事 挺好 谢谢你
No, that's cool. Thank you. Thank you.

1184
01:31:25,890 --> 01:31:29,480
当知道爸死了时 是一种既难过又奇怪的感觉
It was hard telling them strangers there what my father did.

1185
01:31:29,560 --> 01:31:31,560
有时候感觉很好
Sometimes it felt good.

1186
01:31:36,820 --> 01:31:41,030
上一周雨小姐让我们写自己梦想的样子
Last week, Ms. Rain asked us to write down what we wanna be like.

1187
01:31:41,450 --> 01:31:44,990
我写的是 我想要非常苗条
I wrote that I be real skinny,

1188
01:31:45,750 --> 01:31:47,950
黑皮肤 长头发
with Light skin and Long hair.

1189
01:31:49,420 --> 01:31:51,080
路易桑·赫卢威?
Loretta Holloway?

1190
01:31:52,290 --> 01:31:53,420
马上就到
Go on back there.

1191
01:31:53,500 --> 01:31:55,340
她回写道 我现在就很漂亮
She read it and said I'm beautiful like I am.

1192
01:31:55,420 --> 01:31:58,920
这儿也没人和我一起玩
But, there's no kids back there for me to play with.

1193
01:32:01,090 --> 01:32:03,050
闭嘴好好坐着
Just shut up and sit there, then.

1194
01:32:03,140 --> 01:32:06,520
我去和那娘们谈谈话 免得我们饭钱给断了
Gonna talk to this lady before my shit gets cut off.

1195
01:32:06,600 --> 01:32:08,060
不知怎的...
But somehow,

1196
01:32:09,190 --> 01:32:14,150
现在... 我不知道为什么 但是...
right now... And I don't know why, but...

1197
01:32:14,570 --> 01:32:16,320
我想她说得没错
I think she right.

1198
01:32:22,700 --> 01:32:23,780
给你
Here.

1199
01:32:32,460 --> 01:32:34,080
柯瑞丝·琼斯!
Clarence Jones?

1200
01:32:40,050 --> 01:32:42,050
我想她说得没错
I think she right.

1201
01:32:47,310 --> 01:32:47,864
好的 琼斯女士 
Okay, Mrs. Johnston,

1202
01:32:47,865 --> 01:32:49,390
我们来谈谈虐待(abuse也指'滥用')问题
let's talk about the abuse.

1203
01:32:49,480 --> 01:32:51,690
我们家可没有毒品 我不来那个
There were no drugs in my house.

1204
01:32:51,770 --> 01:32:54,559
我们家没毒品 阿珍知道...
I didn't play that. There weren't no drugs in my house. Precious knew I would whup her ass

1205
01:32:54,560 --> 01:32:57,149
如果她带毒品回家 我让她吃不了兜着走
if she gonna bring some drugs up in my house.

1206
01:32:57,150 --> 01:32:59,870
你知道我指的什么
You know what I'm talking about.

1207
01:33:00,650 --> 01:33:05,820
我想特指的是身体上的 性行为上的虐待
I'm referring to specific sexual and physical acts

1208
01:33:06,370 --> 01:33:08,160
涉及到阿珍的
involving Precious.

1209
01:33:08,830 --> 01:33:10,830
你为啥那么说?
Why you ain't say that?

1210
01:33:11,540 --> 01:33:13,160
没错 就是
Yes, that.

1211
01:33:15,210 --> 01:33:17,130
你...你想知道什么?
What do you wanna know?

1212
01:33:17,210 --> 01:33:21,569
如阿珍的档案所写 她已经生过两个孩子
According to Precious' files, she has now had two children

1213
01:33:21,570 --> 01:33:26,503
父亲是 赖特·卡尔·温伍德·琼斯... 
by your boyfriend. the late Carl Kenwood Jones,

1214
01:33:26,504 --> 01:33:28,970
同时也是阿珍的生父?
who was also her father.

1215
01:33:33,980 --> 01:33:35,980
- 是的 - 这是没错的?
- Yeah. - This is accurate?

1216
01:33:38,400 --> 01:33:40,190
是的 怀斯小姐
Yes, Ms. Weiss.

1217
01:33:40,690 --> 01:33:43,780
而你来这里的原因 是因为你打电话到这个办公室
I need to know why you're here. You've been calling this office

1218
01:33:43,860 --> 01:33:47,780
说想要和阿珍重聚 还有你的孙子
saying you want to be reunited with Precious and your grandchild.

1219
01:33:47,870 --> 01:33:51,370
我真的需要知道 那个家里 到底发生了什么?
Now, I really need to know what's gone on in that home.

1220
01:33:51,450 --> 01:33:53,580
怀斯小姐 我明白你想讨论什么 但是...
Ms. Weiss, I understand we need to discuss it,

1221
01:33:53,660 --> 01:33:55,079
我想告诉你 你说我打电话到这里
but I'm just telling you.

1222
01:33:55,080 --> 01:33:59,459
说想再见到阿珍和孙子
You said I've been calling here and I've been wanting to see Precious and my grandson.

1223
01:33:59,460 --> 01:34:04,049
这太逑对了 我就是想见 他们就是属于我的 好么
You're goddamn right I wanna see them. Because they belong to me. Okay?

1224
01:34:04,050 --> 01:34:07,090
曾经有那么一段时间 阿珍什么都不缺
Now, there was a time Precious had everything,

1225
01:34:07,180 --> 01:34:08,970
这你就不知道
and I done told her that.

1226
01:34:09,060 --> 01:34:11,679
而我和卡尔 我们爱阿珍
And me and Carl, we loved Precious. And you need to know that.

1227
01:34:11,680 --> 01:34:15,559
这你应该知道 我们爱阿珍 我们也有过梦想
We loved Precious and we had dreams.

1228
01:34:15,560 --> 01:34:21,390
阿珍出生正好是... 维丝大妈儿子死的时候
Precious was born around the same time Ms. West's son got killed.

1229
01:34:21,780 --> 01:34:25,740
是夏天 她是生在... 在夏天
The summertime. She was born in the summertime.

1230
01:34:25,820 --> 01:34:27,820
还记得么 记得...?
Remember? Remember that?

1231
01:34:28,120 --> 01:34:30,080
我十一月生的
I was born in November.

1232
01:34:30,580 --> 01:34:32,120
十一月...
November.

1233
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:36,590
没错... 说得没错...
Yeah, that's right.

1234
01:34:36,750 --> 01:34:38,630
蛇蝎心肠的孩子
My Scorpio child.

1235
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:42,250
你知道么...
You know...

1236
01:34:42,960 --> 01:34:47,700
蛇蝎心肠 可是... 会很狡猾的
Scorpios, they can be tricky.

1237
01:34:48,220 --> 01:34:52,099
我不是说...我不是说她撒谎了
And, I'm not saying that they lie. I'm not saying that.

1238
01:34:52,100 --> 01:34:56,700
我没有说 但你要注意着点
But you just gotta watch them.

1239
01:34:59,610 --> 01:35:03,400
我们能不能谈谈
Can we talk about the actual acts

1240
01:35:03,480 --> 01:35:06,190
确切发生的事情和性虐待
of physical and sexual abuse

1241
01:35:06,280 --> 01:35:08,740
发生在你家里的
that occurred in your household?

1242
01:35:09,320 --> 01:35:10,870
最早是从什么时候开始?
When it first began,

1243
01:35:10,950 --> 01:35:13,950
在哪里发生的? 你作何反应?
where it happened and how did you respond?

1244
01:35:20,330 --> 01:35:22,500
阿珍还是个小女孩时
Precious was a little girl.

1245
01:35:23,960 --> 01:35:26,970
试试看想起当时她有多大?
Try and remember how old you think she was.

1246
01:35:31,260 --> 01:35:32,800
她当时3岁
She was three.

1247
01:35:34,770 --> 01:35:38,730
我当时... 用奶瓶喂她
And I had been giving her the bottle

1248
01:35:40,150 --> 01:35:42,910
而奶子给卡尔吃
and I was giving Carl the tit tie

1249
01:35:42,980 --> 01:35:47,530
因为我乳房的奶都没了
because my milk hadn't dried up in my breasts

1250
01:35:48,150 --> 01:35:51,990
不过不是因为她 是因为卡尔
but not from her, but because Carl was...

1251
01:35:52,660 --> 01:35:54,580
因为卡尔喝我的奶
Because Carl was sucking on them

1252
01:35:54,660 --> 01:35:58,500
所以我的奶水就不够了
and that's what kept my milk in my breasts.

1253
01:36:01,210 --> 01:36:04,000
而我以为这都是为了卫生
And I thought that that was for hygiene.

1254
01:36:04,920 --> 01:36:07,670
我做的都是我妈妈教给我的...
I did what my mother told me

1255
01:36:08,260 --> 01:36:12,140
做了对我孩子该做的 这就是我做的
that I was supposed to do with my child, so that's what I did.

1256
01:36:12,600 --> 01:36:15,260
而你就那么坐在那里 想来审判我
And you're sitting up there and you're trying to judge me...

1257
01:36:15,350 --> 01:36:18,180
我不是想审判你 但是如果你想申请补助的话
I'm not judging you, but you're asking me for money

1258
01:36:18,270 --> 01:36:20,690
你想和你的孙子重聚的话
and you're asking me to be reunited with your grandson.

1259
01:36:20,770 --> 01:36:23,190
但是 怀斯小姐 我不想让你用那种眼神看着我
But, Ms. Weiss, I don't like you looking at me like that.

1260
01:36:23,360 --> 01:36:26,899
你使唤这个婊子看着我... 好像看着什么操他妈的怪物
You got this bitch looking at me like I'm some kind of fucking monster.

1261
01:36:26,900 --> 01:36:28,899
在我的办公室不允许这么说话 好么?
We don't talk like this in my office, okay?

1262
01:36:28,900 --> 01:36:32,450
我不想他和她做爱 很恶心
I didn't want her sucking behind him, because that was nasty.

1263
01:36:32,530 --> 01:36:37,220
而事情就是那么... 事情就是很肮脏 怀斯小姐
And things that he was... it was just nasty, Ms. Weiss.

1264
01:36:38,420 --> 01:36:40,320
我...我...
I... I...

1265
01:36:41,870 --> 01:36:46,000
我有男人 我有孩子
I had a man, and I have a child

1266
01:36:47,300 --> 01:36:52,030
我两个都要照顾 是吧?
and I had to take care of both of them. Okay?

1267
01:36:52,800 --> 01:36:59,230
难道我想卡尔... 动我的孩子?
Did I want Carl to touch my baby?

1268
01:36:59,890 --> 01:37:02,230
当孩子躺在我身边时
Because I would lay my baby.

1269
01:37:02,310 --> 01:37:07,540
就躺在我身边的枕头上
I would lay her on the side of me, on this pillow

1270
01:37:08,690 --> 01:37:11,460
是个... 那是个粉红的小枕头
and it was pink

1271
01:37:11,570 --> 01:37:14,610
白色的花边 还写着她的名字
and it had this little white writing on it

1272
01:37:14,700 --> 01:37:19,630
就是阿珍
and it had her name, because she was precious.

1273
01:37:19,750 --> 01:37:22,080
我让我的宝贝睡这个枕头
And I would lay my baby on that pillow

1274
01:37:22,160 --> 01:37:26,540
而卡尔躺在床的另一边
and Carl would be laying on the other side

1275
01:37:26,960 --> 01:37:30,840
然后 我们开始...开始 做的时候
and then we would... We would start doing it

1276
01:37:30,920 --> 01:37:33,840
他摸了过来
and he reached over

1277
01:37:35,340 --> 01:37:37,350
他动了我的宝宝
and he touched my baby.

1278
01:37:37,430 --> 01:37:38,970
然后我质问他
And I asked him,

1279
01:37:39,770 --> 01:37:42,350
我说 卡尔 你干什么呢?
I said, "Carl, what are you doing?"

1280
01:37:42,430 --> 01:37:44,850
他跟我说
And he told me to shut...

1281
01:37:44,940 --> 01:37:47,940
闭上你的臭嘴 这是为了她好
To shut my fat ass up, and it was good for her.

1282
01:37:48,020 --> 01:37:51,640
- 那你接下来怎么做了呢? - 我闭上了我的臭嘴啊
- And what did you do then? - I shut my fat ass up.

1283
01:37:51,780 --> 01:37:55,110
我不想你坐在那里审判我 怀斯小姐
And I don't want you to sit there and judge me, Ms. Weiss.

1284
01:37:55,200 --> 01:37:56,950
你闭了嘴 你就让他虐待你的女儿
You shut up and you let him abuse your daughter?

1285
01:37:57,030 --> 01:37:59,119
我不想他虐待我的女儿
I did not want him to abuse my daughter.

1286
01:37:59,120 --> 01:38:00,580
- 我不想他虐待我的女儿 - 但是你允许了
- I did not want him to hurt her. - But you allowed him

1287
01:38:00,660 --> 01:38:01,752
让他那样做 
to hurt her.

1288
01:38:01,753 --> 01:38:04,619
我不想让他对她做任何事 我想他和我做爱
I did not want him to do nothing to her. I wanted him to make love to me.

1289
01:38:04,620 --> 01:38:07,630
那是我的男人 那是我的男人
That was my man. That was my fucking man.

1290
01:38:07,790 --> 01:38:11,230
他是我的男人 但他想要我的女儿
That was my man and he wanted my daughter.

1291
01:38:11,250 --> 01:38:14,299
这就是我之所以恨她
And that's why I hated her.

1292
01:38:14,300 --> 01:38:17,300
因为我的男人应该爱我
Because my man, who was supposed to be loving me,

1293
01:38:17,390 --> 01:38:20,720
应该和我做爱
who was supposed to be making love to me,

1294
01:38:21,310 --> 01:38:23,560
却和我的孩子做爱 而她导致他离开
was fucking my baby.

1295
01:38:23,640 --> 01:38:27,809
是她导致他不回家
She made him leave. She made him go away.

1296
01:38:27,810 --> 01:38:28,940
那到底是谁的错呢?
So, whose fault was it, then?

1297
01:38:29,020 --> 01:38:32,279
那是这个贱人的错! 因为她让我的男人占有她
it's this bitch's fault because she let my man have her

1298
01:38:32,280 --> 01:38:36,029
但她啥也没有做! 她没有尖叫 她什么也没有做!
and she didn't say nothing. She didn't scream. She didn't do nothing.

1299
01:38:36,030 --> 01:38:39,570
那么 她给你说的那么多我怎么对待她
So, those things she told you I did to her,

1300
01:38:39,660 --> 01:38:43,960
那谁...谁 来爱我呢?
who else was gonna love me?

1301
01:38:45,830 --> 01:38:49,460
你以为你有学历 你他妈的就什么东西都懂?
Since you got your degree and you know every fucking thing?

1302
01:38:49,540 --> 01:38:53,590
谁又来爱我? 谁来让我觉得好受?
who was gonna love me, who was gonna make me feel good?

1303
01:38:53,670 --> 01:38:57,340
谁又能抚摸我 让我快乐 当夜晚到来的时候?
Who was gonna touch me and make me feel good late at night?

1304
01:38:57,430 --> 01:38:59,369
她使得他一去不回
And she made him go away,

1305
01:38:59,370 --> 01:39:04,309
所以 当你坐在那里 在你的笔记本上写下这纪录时
so... When you sit there and you write them fucking notes on your pad

1306
01:39:04,310 --> 01:39:09,370
写你觉得我怎么样 我都做过什么 这一切
about who you think I am, and why I did it, all of that.

1307
01:39:09,690 --> 01:39:11,900
因为我也一无所有
Because I didn't have nobody.

1308
01:39:20,700 --> 01:39:24,670
那些人... 来自...
The people from

1309
01:39:25,500 --> 01:39:27,540
一对一教学的那些
Each One Teach One,

1310
01:39:28,250 --> 01:39:31,770
他们曾... 他们告诉我...
they had... They called me

1311
01:39:34,170 --> 01:39:37,260
他们告诉我我的孩子在写诗
and they told me that my baby was writing poems.

1312
01:39:37,340 --> 01:39:38,840
事实上...知道么? 我拿来了...
in fact, you know what, I got...

1313
01:39:38,930 --> 01:39:40,510
等一下...
Wait a minute.

1314
01:40:06,500 --> 01:40:07,950
对不起 对不起
I'm sorry.

1315
01:40:08,960 --> 01:40:12,419
怀斯小姐 我不想要支票
I'm sorry. And, Ms. Weiss, I don't want no checks.

1316
01:40:12,420 --> 01:40:16,680
我不想要钱 拜托了 我很抱歉
I don't need no more money. Please. I'm so sorry.

1317
01:40:17,550 --> 01:40:19,720
我又做了一次那个测试
I took that TABE test again.

1318
01:40:20,380 --> 01:40:22,080
怎么样?
And what happened?

1319
01:40:22,140 --> 01:40:23,800
我得了7.8分
I scored a 7.8.

1320
01:40:25,510 --> 01:40:27,430
上一次是2.8分
Last time it was 2.8.

1321
01:40:29,810 --> 01:40:31,190
按照那个测试
According to that test,

1322
01:40:31,270 --> 01:40:33,980
我读书是7- 8年级的水平了
I'm reading at a seventh and eighth- grade level.

1323
01:40:35,270 --> 01:40:39,440
接下来我要读高中 再接下来读大学
Next year, high school. After that, college.

1324
01:40:44,990 --> 01:40:46,780
但我也喜欢你
Well, I like you, too.

1325
01:40:49,120 --> 01:40:51,160
但你不能解决我的事
But you can't handle me.

1326
01:40:52,390 --> 01:40:55,490
这些都不是你的能力范围
You can't handle none of this.

1327
01:41:03,220 --> 01:41:06,640
知道么 直到今天我才知道你的过去
You know, I never knew what you was until this day.

1328
01:41:06,720 --> 01:41:09,470
在你做的那一切之后
Not even after all them things you did.

1329
01:41:10,980 --> 01:41:15,790
或许是我太傻 也许是我就是不想要
Maybe I was too stupid, or maybe I just didn't want to.

1330
01:41:16,940 --> 01:41:19,280
你再也别想见到我了
You ain't gonna see me no more.

1331
01:41:22,860 --> 01:41:24,160
再见
Bye!

1332
01:41:27,870 --> 01:41:29,740
我不想他伤害我的孩子
I didn't want him to hurt my baby.

1333
01:41:29,830 --> 01:41:32,250
拜托 天啊 我从来没想伤害我的孩子
Please, God, I didn't want him to hurt my baby.

1334
01:41:32,330 --> 01:41:35,210
怀斯小姐 我不想他伤害我的孩子
Ms. Weiss, I didn't want him to hurt my baby.

1335
01:41:35,290 --> 01:41:36,499
我跟他说了
I would say to him, I would say...

1336
01:41:36,500 --> 01:41:40,800
我说 卡尔 你在干什么? 你在干什么 你在干什么?
"Carl, what are you doing? What are you doing? What are you doing?"

1337
01:41:49,520 --> 01:41:51,100
你能让她回来么?
Can you go get her back?

1338
01:41:51,180 --> 01:41:53,770
你能做到的 因为这是你的工作
You can do that, because that's what you do.

1339
01:41:53,850 --> 01:41:55,690
这是你的工作
That's what you do.

1340
01:41:56,110 --> 01:41:59,820
我需要你去 把我的孩子带回来
I need you to go and I need you to get my baby back.

1341
01:41:59,900 --> 01:42:03,700
你告诉我 我可以来这里 你...可以...
You told me that I could come in here and you could get...

1342
01:42:03,990 --> 01:42:05,450
让阿珍和我谈
You could get Precious to say...

1343
01:42:05,530 --> 01:42:09,210
怀斯小姐 怀斯小姐
Ms. Weiss? Ms. Weiss? Ms. Weiss?

1344
01:42:09,310 --> 01:42:18,110
# 花了那么久才找到此处

1345
01:42:19,110 --> 01:42:27,310
# 花了那么久才得到快乐

1346
01:42:27,611 --> 01:42:35,510
# 花了那么久才认清你的脸庞

1347
01:42:37,010 --> 01:42:43,610
# 花了那么久四处追寻

1348
01:42:43,710 --> 01:42:51,510
# 花了那么久才找到此处

1349
01:42:51,910 --> 01:42:58,710
# 花了那么久才得到快乐

1350
01:42:59,810 --> 01:43:07,310
# 花了那么久才认清你的脸庞

1351
01:43:07,410 --> 01:43:14,520
# 花了那么久四处追寻

1352
01:43:15,920 --> 01:43:19,910
# 美事得来皆不易

1353
01:43:19,920 --> 01:43:23,320
# 皆不可急求

1354
01:43:23,720 --> 01:43:27,120
# 急促得来的爱

1355
01:43:27,520 --> 01:43:30,820
# 都将难以持久

1356
01:43:31,320 --> 01:43:39,420
# 所以花了那么 那么多年期遇

1357
01:43:39,421 --> 01:43:42,620
# 直到我们在一起前

1358
01:43:42,920 --> 01:43:47,620
# 我都是不完整的
