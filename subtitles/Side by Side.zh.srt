00:00:38,608 --> 00:00:40,883
1880年代末起
since the late 1880s

2
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,461
視覺藝術家和說故事的人
visual artist and story-tellers

3
00:00:43,462 --> 00:00:46,990
開始使用動態影像來創造神奇的世界
have used moving images to create amazing worlds

4
00:00:49,832 --> 00:00:51,690
電影給我們啟示
movies have inspired us

5
00:00:53,908 --> 00:00:56,973
激勵我們並捕捉我們的想像
thrilled us and capture our imaginations

6
00:00:58,254 --> 00:01:02,248
膠卷，曾幫助我們分享經驗和夢想
film, has helped us to share our experiences and dreams

7
00:01:05,196 --> 00:01:08,168
化學膠卷曾經是唯一用來
photo chemical film, has been the exclusive format

8
00:01:08,169 --> 00:01:13,180
捕捉、沖洗、放映和儲存動態影像的格式
capture, develop, project and store moving images

9
00:01:13,181 --> 00:01:15,088
百年來不曾變過
for over 100 years

10
00:01:21,340 --> 00:01:24,683
近些年才發展起一種新技術
it was only resently that a new technology had immerged

11
00:01:24,699 --> 00:01:29,575
代表影像品質和工作流程的膠卷，其崇高地位正受到挑戰
that challenging film place of gold standards for quality and workflow

12
00:01:30,685 --> 00:01:33,611
數位技術已經進化到可以替代膠卷
digital technology is evolving to a point that

13
00:01:33,612 --> 00:01:36,444
執行最主要的任務：
means very well replace film as the prirary mean

14
00:01:36,445 --> 00:01:40,066
創造和分享動態影像
of creating and sharing motion pictures

15
00:01:40,573 --> 00:01:43,451
<i>這部記錄作品叫《side by side》
the documentary doing is called side by side</i>

16
00:01:43,756 --> 00:01:48,493
涉及到數位電影的科學、藝術和影響
it's the documentary about science, art and impact of digital cinema

17
00:01:48,565 --> 00:01:51,583
一百年的化學膠卷發展
100 years of photo chemical film making

18
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:56,436
目前已經到達了一個臨界狀態
right now it reached a kind of threshold of tipping point

19
00:01:57,114 --> 00:02:01,492
這場對話，這個關鍵時刻
in this conversaton, in this intersection of time

20
00:02:01,493 --> 00:02:02,607
是歷史性的
is historic

21
00:02:02,686 --> 00:02:05,612
我們怕是已經來到了
we've kind of come to this place where

22
00:02:05,613 --> 00:02:08,677
膠卷電影的末日
it is the end of film

23
00:02:08,699 --> 00:02:10,928
我們今在何方
where are we today

24
00:02:11,201 --> 00:02:15,287
這很令人興奮，因為這是重新創造的新媒介
it's exciting, because it's a re-invention of new medium

25
00:02:16,755 --> 00:02:21,028
如果化學攝影法可以呈現我們的綺麗文化
if the photo chemical process has virtues through our culture

26
00:02:22,326 --> 00:02:23,766
另一形式有何不可？
why aren't you another level

27
00:02:24,577 --> 00:02:26,295
關鍵是你怎麼用它說故事
how do you use it to tell a story

28
00:02:26,312 --> 00:02:28,541
怎麼用它去描繪一個情境
how do you use it to paint apicture

29
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:31,439
您打算和膠卷一刀兩斷了嗎？
are you done with film

30
00:02:31,801 --> 00:02:33,575
不要故意引導我，基努
don't hold me to it, Keanu

31
00:02:33,578 --> 00:02:34,922
不過
but…

32
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,399
我想是的
I think I am

33
00:02:37,918 --> 00:02:43,305
數位攝影機是電影業的新美學手法
digital cameras are the new aesthetic that coming to cinema

34
00:02:43,500 --> 00:02:48,422
同時我們又哀悼膠卷的凋零
and at the same time we are going to mourn the loss of film

35
00:02:49,781 --> 00:02:53,636
我可以明確的指出為什麼要用膠卷拍電影
I am costly(?) to justify where and why I shoot a film by film

36
00:02:53,909 --> 00:03:00,579
不過實話說我沒聽說過誰知道為啥一定要用數位拍電影
But I don't hear anybody being honestly to justify why they want to shoot a film digitally

37
00:03:00,746 --> 00:03:04,322
我希望我所想像的一切都能真實展示
I want everything I could imagine to be something we can realize

38
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,690
不過膠卷很難實現這一點
I saw the door opening on a field of possibility that you just couldn't do it with film

39
00:03:10,622 --> 00:03:13,269
如今比較悲哀的是
It's really sad right now

40
00:03:13,316 --> 00:03:18,099
攝影開始大量使用數位技術
to see cameras cording imagery a serial way

41
00:03:18,595 --> 00:03:21,195
取代膠卷
starting to take over film

42
00:03:21,195 --> 00:03:25,111
{\a6}膠卷拍攝

43
00:03:21,396 --> 00:03:25,111
我不需要把我的油畫換成蠟筆畫（畫面質感）
I'm not gonna trade my oil paintings to seta crayons

44
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,600
{\a6}數位拍攝

45
00:03:28,267 --> 00:03:31,750
有人看好數位技術
there will be people who will chip in digital

46
00:03:31,751 --> 00:03:36,023
也有人不僅想殺掉這隻生金蛋的鵝
there will be people who will not only kill the goose lay the golden egg

47
00:03:36,024 --> 00:03:39,297
還要在之前把它搞得一團糟
they'll sort of mess it first

48
00:03:39,251 --> 00:03:41,620
如果數位技術取代膠卷
if the intention of that digital will replace film

49
00:03:41,621 --> 00:03:45,871
正好是因為我們所討厭它的一些方面，那很悲哀
I'll be sad if it's doing acturally exactly where we hate it

50
00:03:48,915 --> 00:03:53,838
因為數位能夠做的膠卷效果，膠卷當然做得更好
because that digital now can make it look like film that film is inherently better

51
00:03:53,839 --> 00:03:55,768
若就因為我們喜歡這種更好的感覺
just we like the way it looks better

52
00:03:55,769 --> 00:03:58,555
（就否定數位技術）這有點專斷
which seems kind of arbitrary that we were used to

53
00:03:59,614 --> 00:04:01,983
膠卷是19世紀的發明
film is a 19th century invention

54
00:04:02,098 --> 00:04:04,559
我們已經到達了化學攝影法的頂峰
we are on the top of photo chemical process

55
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:06,278
很難再有進步
this is about as far as ever we can go

56
00:04:06,827 --> 00:04:08,591
數位技術發展至今
digital is here now

57
00:04:08,705 --> 00:04:09,820
還有很長的路要走
but it's gonna keep going

58
00:04:10,361 --> 00:04:11,619
你會是數位發展的參與者
and you're gonna be part of that

59
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:13,801
參與者將決定數位技術的未來
who's be gonna be a part of that dictating where that goes

60
00:04:14,453 --> 00:04:15,885
我覺得膠卷不會怎樣
I don't think films going anywhere

61
00:04:15,886 --> 00:04:20,948
我不覺得影像從此將完全摒棄膠卷
I don't think it's to the image or anybody to totally eliminate film

62
00:04:20,949 --> 00:04:23,177
會有很多人加入我們，為膠卷而戰
there gonna be many of us, they'll fight for film

63
00:04:23,272 --> 00:04:25,223
為在感光劑上攝影的經驗而戰
fight for the experience of shooting on emulsion

64
00:04:26,871 --> 00:04:30,865
我們處於某種變革的迷霧中
we really are in the mist of some sort of revolution

65
00:04:30,866 --> 00:04:33,698
這種變革威脅到影片的基本品質
that threatens the status qual

66
00:04:33,699 --> 00:04:38,017
所以這既是可怕的又是輕易
it's so potentially either scary thing or very liberating thing

67
00:04:52,647 --> 00:04:55,241
電影製作第一步：
one of the first steps of production process

68
00:04:55,242 --> 00:04:58,802
捕捉影像
is capturing the images in camera

69
00:04:59,366 --> 00:05:03,711
導演、演員、攝影師和製作團隊
the director, actors, cinematographer and the entire production team

70
00:05:03,712 --> 00:05:06,173
共同努力讓劇本活起來
work together to bring the script to life

71
00:05:07,390 --> 00:05:12,034
攝影技術師，也叫攝影指導或DP
the cinematographer, also called the director of photography or DP

72
00:05:12,469 --> 00:05:15,162
幫助導演達成電影的影像效果
helps the director achieve the look of the movie

73
00:05:16,178 --> 00:05:19,615
DP的職責在於決定攝影裝備
the DP is responsible for knowing what equipment is needed

74
00:05:19,616 --> 00:05:22,726
以及深諳其攝影原理
and how it works in order to capture the scenes

75
00:05:28,103 --> 00:05:33,085
攝影指導要注意色彩和構圖
a director of photography looks at color and composition

76
00:05:30,918 --> 00:05:35,862
{\a6}大衛 芬奇 導演
（社群網戰 / 鬥陣俱樂部 / 火線追緝令）

77
00:05:33,086 --> 00:05:38,148
以及角度和其他構成電影的元素
and angles and all those things in terms of how the movie is being built

78
00:05:38,515 --> 00:05:41,255
光照到皮膚的感覺，光穿過頭髮的效果
the quality of light of skin, the quality of light through hair,

79
00:05:41,256 --> 00:05:44,367
光透過窗戶反射在地板上的效果
the quality of light through the window and bouncing off the floor

80
00:05:45,111 --> 00:05:48,734
這些都要與真實世界相同
they're equating the building of this world

81
00:05:48,821 --> 00:05:51,890
包括每個物件的
and terms of energy

82
00:05:51,894 --> 00:05:54,773
光學反射效果
that reflects off objects

83
00:05:54,774 --> 00:05:58,581
關鍵在於
the question is about

84
00:05:58,582 --> 00:06:02,028
如何讓構圖跟情感穿越畫面到人的心裡面
framing, sensibility, how to make people feel

85
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:05,028
{\a6}邁克爾 查普曼，攝影師
（計程車司機 / 蠻牛 / 粗野少年族）

86
00:06:02,168 --> 00:06:04,769
把情緒付諸光影
bringing emotion into the lights

87
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:06,884
基於要恰當的處理光影
comes from being appropriate and somehow being

88
00:06:06,885 --> 00:06:09,670
不過更棒的是超越“恰當”
the really great is, more than appropriate

89
00:06:09,671 --> 00:06:11,946
真正讓人驚奇的是
they really startle you with how wonderfully

90
00:06:11,946 --> 00:06:14,871
我能如何漂亮的呈現所有動作
I could have this look is on whatever they're doing

91
00:06:11,964 --> 00:06:14,871
{\a6}計程車司機，1976

92
00:06:15,596 --> 00:06:20,797
這種專業技術水準上
That level of crossmanship? or technical expertise

93
00:06:17,596 --> 00:06:20,670
{\a6}約翰 麥德森，攝影師
（神鬼戰士 / 浪人47 / X戰警：第一戰）

94
00:06:20,798 --> 00:06:22,422
你沒法解釋自己要做什麼
You can't explain what you're gonna do

95
00:06:22,423 --> 00:06:25,441
所以他們必須把你當回事
so there is a certain matter of leap of faith that they have to having you

96
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:29,100
{\a6}現代啟示錄，1979

97
00:06:30,670 --> 00:06:33,670
{\a6}維多里歐 史托拉洛，攝影師
（現代啟示錄 / 末代皇帝 / 小活佛）

98
00:06:28,332 --> 00:06:30,515
作為攝影師
To be a cinematographer

99
00:06:30,516 --> 00:06:33,859
要有藝術方面的知識
is to have the knowledge of the art

100
00:06:33,860 --> 00:06:40,500
毫無疑問，電影是一種利用科技實現的綜合藝術
Without any doubt, cinema today is a mix of art in technology

101
00:06:41,670 --> 00:06:44,670
{\a6}大衛 史坦普，視覺特效
（X戰警，X戰警2，星戰毀滅者）

102
00:06:40,592 --> 00:06:44,121
如今在這個領域還要懂點技術才行
Today, in this area, you also have to be a bit of technician

103
00:06:44,122 --> 00:06:45,514
你得懂設備
You have to know the equipment

104
00:06:45,514 --> 00:06:51,598
明白成像流程的所有環節對DP來說非常重要
It's really important for DP to understand the entire links of the image chain

105
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:55,499
從完成任務到創新
From acquisition to excavation

106
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,761
攝影機是測量光跡並使其聚焦
The camera is a tool that focuses and measures

107
00:07:09,762 --> 00:07:12,594
並以影像形式將其記錄的工具
Photons of light and record them in images

108
00:07:14,210 --> 00:07:15,835
透過膠卷攝影機
With a film camera

109
00:07:15,836 --> 00:07:19,922
光透過鏡頭並照射到電影膠卷上
Light enter through the lens and hits the frame film behind the lens

110
00:07:21,836 --> 00:07:26,758
膠卷表面塗有含鹵化銀晶體顆粒的乳劑
The film is covered emulsion that contain grains of silver halides crystals

111
00:07:27,647 --> 00:07:30,573
這些晶體在光照下會發生化學反應
These crystals react chemically when light hits them

112
00:07:30,745 --> 00:07:34,102
顯影時晶體會轉化為金屬銀
And the crystal change to silver metal when they are developed

113
00:07:34,598 --> 00:07:38,127
這樣拍攝的影像就在膠卷上形成了
A photograph image is formed on the film

114
00:07:40,102 --> 00:07:43,102
{\a6}瑞德 穆拉諾，攝影師
（冰原之心 / 我們是一群小鳥 / 親親愛倫）

115
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:44,851
對於膠卷的質感和顆粒感
There is something about the texture of the grain structure of film

116
00:07:44,852 --> 00:07:51,260
我個人會調整直到覺得舒服
That personally I hold on till it's like a comforting thing to me

117
00:07:51,312 --> 00:07:53,912
這種感覺更像是可觸的
And it feels more tangible

118
00:07:54,751 --> 00:07:58,280
我打開並輕擊它們的時候很有質感
How I open up and flip themselves give sort of touch of quality

119
00:07:59,102 --> 00:08:02,102
{\a6}布拉德福德 楊，攝影師
（賤民 / Nasceu Maria / 受詛咒的密西西比）

120
00:07:58,524 --> 00:08:01,403
這種圖片的顆粒感
Still have some granularity in the image that

121
00:08:01,404 --> 00:08:04,375
可以讓強光生動
keeps high light living and keeps blacks

122
00:08:04,376 --> 00:08:06,000
並賦予暗光更多微妙特性
with a little bit more nuance characters in them

123
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,400
{\a6}迪克 普伯，攝影師
（秘密與謊言 / 魔術師 / 無憂無慮）

124
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,065
我熱愛顆粒感和紋理
I greaten grain and texture

125
00:08:09,065 --> 00:08:13,012
它們能給你多種多樣的選擇
they give you a variety of different opportunities

126
00:08:09,065 --> 00:08:12,065
{\a6}魔術師，2006

127
00:08:14,208 --> 00:08:15,833
膠卷拍攝的基本流程
The workflow on the film set

128
00:08:15,834 --> 00:08:20,338
就是你要帶上幾千呎的膠卷
Basically means that you take thousand-foot load of film

129
00:08:20,339 --> 00:08:22,567
裝到膠卷盒裡
loaded in to the magazines

130
00:08:22,617 --> 00:08:28,283
每卷也就夠你拍個10分鐘多一點
And that enable you to shoot for roughly 10+ minutes per roll of film

131
00:08:31,103 --> 00:08:34,122
接著是休息時間
And it gives a natural break of action

132
00:08:34,123 --> 00:08:36,722
這時候有人把拍滿的膠卷拽出來
when someone pulls the magazine off the camera

133
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:38,486
再把新膠卷放進去
And put a new magazine on

134
00:08:40,210 --> 00:08:44,064
接著這些膠卷會被送到膠卷實驗室
Then the film goes away to the film lab

135
00:08:45,069 --> 00:08:47,623
過夜顯影
And it developed over night

136
00:08:47,625 --> 00:08:49,853
然後沖印
And printed

137
00:08:56,428 --> 00:08:59,121
第二天樣片出爐
And in the next day, you could see dailys

138
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,554
有好多年這都是一件樂事
There was a joy for many many years

139
00:09:04,889 --> 00:09:07,889
{\a6}珊迪 希瑟，攝影師
（拜見布朗一家 / 早安孟買 / 餓鬼之家）

140
00:09:04,555 --> 00:09:08,640
因為我們是片場幽靈
For us to be the genes on set

141
00:09:08,641 --> 00:09:10,544
所以我們熱愛樣片
That's why we like dailys

142
00:09:10,545 --> 00:09:13,842
我們都去表演，我們喜歡這樣
We'd all go, we'd act, we'd like

143
00:09:13,843 --> 00:09:15,746
我們愛幹嘛幹嘛，也喜歡我們幹的事
We'd do all we do, and we'd love what we did

144
00:09:15,747 --> 00:09:17,464
接著每個人都入了迷
and then everybody would rapt

145
00:09:17,465 --> 00:09:19,647
然後第二天一早我們回實驗室的時候
and the next morning we came back in the lab

146
00:09:19,648 --> 00:09:21,736
我們驚訝的說：看我們都幹了什麼好事
We went “wow, look what we got.”

147
00:09:21,737 --> 00:09:22,873
這真是神奇
You know it was magic

148
00:09:23,746 --> 00:09:26,746
{\a6}唐納 麥卡派恩，攝影師
（金剛狼 / 紅磨坊 / 終極戰士團）

149
00:09:22,874 --> 00:09:25,427
攝影指導是魔術師
The director of photography was a magician

150
00:09:25,691 --> 00:09:29,963
他是唯一真正可能知道
He was the only? one who actually, probably knew

151
00:09:29,964 --> 00:09:32,192
第二天樣片會怎麼樣的人
what's gonna beyond the screen the next day

152
00:09:32,457 --> 00:09:35,754
這給了你不少權勢和夥伴
And this gets you a lot of authority and pal

153
00:09:36,420 --> 00:09:40,079
拍攝的時候你得有種堅定的信念
There is a certain believe of faith you take when you shoot the film

154
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:42,365
這很浪漫的
And there are something really romantic about that

155
00:09:42,365 --> 00:09:46,591
樣片回來每個人都興沖沖想看看你拍了些什麼
Get your dailys back and everyone being really excited to see what you got

156
00:09:46,786 --> 00:09:51,059
我不喜歡被樣片背叛
I don't like the betrayal of dailys

157
00:09:51,060 --> 00:09:57,049
我不喜歡去全神貫注的看表演時候
I don't like going in and seeing and getting swept up with the performance

158
00:09:57,050 --> 00:10:00,950
在25呎的螢幕上發現拍攝失焦了
And then seeing go out focus on 25-foot screen

159
00:10:00,951 --> 00:10:04,387
而且還知道這重來不了
and knowing that there's no way to retrieve that

160
00:10:04,387 --> 00:10:08,387
{\a6}羅伯特 羅德里格茲，導演/攝影師
（萬惡城市 / 小鬼大間諜 / 英雄不回頭

161
00:10:04,388 --> 00:10:06,466
拍電影的時候有種感覺
But in like a film about that feeling

162
00:10:06,467 --> 00:10:09,020
過了半天一天
midway to the day, end of the day

163
00:10:09,021 --> 00:10:11,203
真的拍了什麼東西嗎？我不記得我拍了些什麼
did we get anything, that day? I didn't remember, I didn't get it

164
00:10:11,302 --> 00:10:13,577
因為你看不見所以沒有拍過的痕跡
Didn't feel we put the flag in it cause you couldn't see

165
00:10:13,578 --> 00:10:15,249
就像關了燈畫畫
it's like painting with the lights off

166
00:10:15,249 --> 00:10:16,782
但是DP會告訴你：
But the DP will tell you:

167
00:10:16,783 --> 00:10:19,568
沒啊，燈沒關，都在我腦子裡呢
it's not, the lights aren't off, it's in my head

168
00:10:19,864 --> 00:10:21,304
在他腦子裡，這不錯
It's in his head, well that's great

169
00:10:21,305 --> 00:10:22,836
但扛攝影機的不是我
but I'm off bringing the camera

170
00:10:22,837 --> 00:10:25,576
選鏡頭的也不是我，我就管表演怎麼樣
picking the lenses, I'm judging the performances

171
00:10:27,602 --> 00:10:30,435
數位攝影機不使用膠卷
A digital camera does not use film

172
00:10:30,531 --> 00:10:35,175
相對的，鏡頭後是電子感光元件或晶片
Instead, it has an electronic sensor or chip behind the lens

173
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:39,900
感光元件由許多微小的圖像元素構成
The sensor, is made up with millions of tiny picture elements

174
00:10:39,901 --> 00:10:41,860
或簡稱圖元
or pixels for short

175
00:10:42,825 --> 00:10:44,451
當光進入攝影機的時候
when light enters the camera

176
00:10:44,452 --> 00:10:49,000
撞擊元件並產生各自獨立的電子電荷
it hit the pixels and create individual electronic charges

177
00:10:49,267 --> 00:10:54,700
這些電荷被放大後轉化為代表圖像的數位資訊
these charges are magnifying converted into digital data that represent the image

178
00:10:57,900 --> 00:11:00,900
{\a6}大衛 塔特肖，攝影師
（星際大戰1-3 / 駭速快手 / 綠色奇蹟）

179
00:10:55,779 --> 00:10:58,751
用膠卷拍攝由於它一直在轉
ring the film that it just constantly moving

180
00:10:58,752 --> 00:11:01,689
所以總有點模糊
So the result is kind of fuzziness

181
00:11:03,452 --> 00:11:05,821
而圖元這樣的東西
well the pixel kind

182
00:11:05,822 --> 00:11:11,301
是非常細緻精確的
is very fine-line, accurate, exact thing

183
00:11:18,307 --> 00:11:20,443
用帶顯示器的數位攝影機
with digital cameras in monitors

184
00:11:20,444 --> 00:11:24,715
你能在拍攝的同時觀看拍下的東西
you are able to see exactly what you are recording on sight as you're shooting

185
00:11:26,458 --> 00:11:27,991
不同於膠卷攝影機
unlike film cameras

186
00:11:27,992 --> 00:11:30,731
你不用等上一天才能看自己拍了些什麼
you don't have to wait a day to see what you've captured

187
00:11:31,275 --> 00:11:32,715
樣片不再是“隔天的”
they're no longer dailys

188
00:11:33,186 --> 00:11:35,369
而是“即可得的”
they are “immediatelys”

（皇家賭場 / 蒙面俠蘇洛 / 藍色小精靈）

190
00:11:35,749 --> 00:11:38,536
你坐在片場或帳篷什麼的地方
You sit round back of the set or in the tent somewhere

191
00:11:38,537 --> 00:11:40,254
看著巨型顯示器
looking at the huge monitor

192
00:11:40,254 --> 00:11:41,635
然後透過這個作調整
and make adjustment from that

193
00:11:41,636 --> 00:11:42,843
這和現場調整沒什麼兩樣
which is actually quite alike

194
00:11:42,844 --> 00:11:45,629
因為你看到畫面就是現場
because that means you seeing the picture exactly it is

195
00:11:45,630 --> 00:11:47,722
用膠卷的話，一個拍攝
And with old film, a capture

196
00:11:47,723 --> 00:11:49,998
要過夜才能看，而且有時會擔心
it was overnight and sometime you got the burden

197
00:11:49,999 --> 00:11:51,438
我是不是拍的沒問題
that “I wonder if I go there right”

198
00:11:51,809 --> 00:11:55,710
(?)我認為不管樣片有多好都得有個後備措施
(?)I think we need more backine and don't worry how great daily is

199
00:11:52,843 --> 00:11:55,843
{\a6}喬治 盧卡斯，導演/製片人
（星際大戰1-4  /  500年後  /  美國風情畫）

200
00:11:56,394 --> 00:11:59,041
誰都知道看樣片怎麼回事
They know as well as anybody that you go to dailys

201
00:11:59,042 --> 00:12:01,409
不過我真覺得應該有更多後備措施
and I really think there should be more backline in there

202
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:02,896
你要是在片場幹過
But If you do it on the set

203
00:12:02,897 --> 00:12:05,310
就知道後備措施的重要性了
You can understand it, more backlines

204
00:12:06,363 --> 00:12:08,732
（數位攝影）實現了這點，這很好，就是我想要的
And they do it, it's ok cause that is exactly what I want

205
00:12:08,733 --> 00:12:11,054
因為在電影院放出來也是這樣
cause it exactly is the way could be in the movie theater

206
00:12:11,410 --> 00:12:12,525
人們都這麼說：
People speak about:

207
00:12:12,526 --> 00:12:14,382
謝天謝地，我能看見我正在拍的東西
thank god, I can see what I'm getting on

208
00:12:14,383 --> 00:12:16,147
我不用等到明天早上了
I don't have to wait until tomorrow

209
00:12:16,148 --> 00:12:18,655
我能更專注，我知道我在拍什麼
I can see it and focus on it I know what I'm getting

210
00:12:19,732 --> 00:12:22,732
{\a6}克里斯多夫 諾蘭，導演
（黑暗騎士 / 全面啟動I / 記憶拼圖）

211
00:12:18,723 --> 00:12:20,581
在片場看顯示器
few watching the monitor on set

212
00:12:20,582 --> 00:12:23,197
你覺得你真的看到你拍的東西了
and you feel that you really seeing what you've got

213
00:12:23,198 --> 00:12:24,544
其實這種想法欺騙了你
this thinking is fooling yourself

214
00:12:24,545 --> 00:12:29,560
你的觀眾是要在1000倍大的螢幕上看這些東西
Your audience are gonna watch the film on the screen is 1000 times bigger

215
00:12:29,561 --> 00:12:31,371
你只是在大電視上看
you watch it on large TV

216
00:12:32,570 --> 00:12:35,310
沒錯，你能看見自己拍了什麼，就在那
Yes, you see what you get it, that's right there

217
00:12:36,227 --> 00:12:39,227
{\a6}馬丁 史科西斯，導演
紐約黑幫 / 計程車司機 / 四海好傢伙

218
00:12:36,227 --> 00:12:39,013
我的經驗建議之後再看拍的東西
Proof for me that I think you need to see rushes later

219
00:12:39,527 --> 00:12:41,756
我認為這是集中精力的方法
I think it's concentrate

220
00:12:42,073 --> 00:12:45,097
表演或僅僅是動作
But the performances or just the movement

221
00:12:45,098 --> 00:12:47,977
你可以在特定的時間去看
that is something you can see in a special time

222
00:12:48,279 --> 00:12:54,502
攝製電影的過程是攝影指導的技術和秘密
The process of shooting film was the DP's art and secret

223
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:57,560
{\a6}查理 何茲費得，特藝彩色紐約市場部高級副總裁

224
00:12:54,583 --> 00:12:58,810
現在攝影師只是數位攝影前面的顯示器
Today the cinematographer is a monitor on the digital shoot

225
00:12:58,811 --> 00:13:04,800
他們拍什麼都能被看見，並任人評判
and everything they are doing could seen, criticized and questioned

226
00:13:05,752 --> 00:13:07,748
有時這挺讓人分心的
It's very distractive sometimes

227
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:10,800
{\a6}喬 舒馬赫，導演
（蝙蝠俠3 / 絕命鈴聲 / 粗野少年族）

228
00:13:07,749 --> 00:13:10,117
我和幾個演員一起工作
I work with a couple of actors

229
00:13:10,118 --> 00:13:14,795
每天堅持和其中某一個看（樣片）
that insist on I'm look at it everyday with one of the actors

230
00:13:14,796 --> 00:13:16,421
我可以邊看邊說
I was able to talk among of it

231
00:13:16,422 --> 00:13:18,929
因為這能讓他的表演變得非常自信
because it's making his performances very self-conscious

232
00:13:18,976 --> 00:13:19,858
是嗎？
Right?

233
00:13:19,859 --> 00:13:23,999
你是不是聽說他們都只看他們的頭髮而已？
Are you also convinced that everybody is just looking at their hair?

234
00:13:24,604 --> 00:13:28,458
作為攝影師最大樂趣之一
One of the great pleasure that being a cameraman was

235
00:13:28,459 --> 00:13:32,136
那些尊崇製片人意願的人
that the people who was the suits on the producer

236
00:13:32,137 --> 00:13:33,214
他們都覺得自己知道怎麼表演
They all think they know how to act

237
00:13:33,215 --> 00:13:34,458
他們都覺得自己知道怎麼寫劇本
they all think they know how to write

238
00:13:34,459 --> 00:13:35,572
他們都覺得自己知道怎麼導演
they all think they know how to direct

239
00:13:35,573 --> 00:13:37,254
但是他們都知道自己不會攝影
But they knew they didn't knew how to shoot

240
00:13:37,651 --> 00:13:39,880
這完全取決於你
So I say this is really got on you

241
00:13:39,881 --> 00:13:41,412
你可以說：看吧，這片子是你做的
you could say: here, this the media you do it

242
00:13:41,404 --> 00:13:42,797
我才是魔術師
I was the charmer

243
00:13:43,219 --> 00:13:47,306
不過現在會攝影是另一碼事了
But now, being a thing that you can shoot is not like it used to be

244
00:13:47,518 --> 00:13:52,115
有些攝影師之所以當攝影師
There're cinematographers who became cinematographers

245
00:13:52,301 --> 00:13:55,691
是因為他們熱愛攝影的魔力
because they love the voodoo of it

246
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,229
他們喜歡導演對他們說：
They love it when the director said to them:

247
00:13:58,230 --> 00:13:59,715
“那個角落
“down that cornor”

248
00:13:59,716 --> 00:14:03,058
你能看見嗎？好像要消失了”
will you able to that? that's kind of melt away”

249
00:14:03,059 --> 00:14:05,879
他們倒是機靈：“明天看嘛，肯定超驚喜，包你滿意”
they get to guile: “ just wait till tomorrow, it's gonna be amazing, you're gonna love it.”

251
00:14:05,880 --> 00:14:11,396
接下來，我經歷過的，他們把樣片搞定了，我就會…
and then, I had this experience, they've set the dailys then I've gone

252
00:14:11,397 --> 00:14:14,934
<i>比如《火線追緝令》裡有些令人興奮的東西就是表現不出來
some of the durance can't just work on se7en you just go "wow"</i>

253
00:14:15,385 --> 00:14:20,000
不過倒是有個差不多的人在，所以你就會
but there is the an equal man on time so you go:

254
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:24,673
看著它說：“這他媽怎麼回事？”
look at it and say: “what the fuck?”

255
00:14:25,375 --> 00:14:27,325
現在有了數位攝影機
Now with digital cameras

256
00:14:27,326 --> 00:14:32,248
人人都能看見拍攝的結果
everyone could see exactly what things were going to look like

257
00:14:32,249 --> 00:14:33,791
這改變了你從前對攝影的喜愛方式
that changes the way you like it

258
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:36,554
甚至改變了你的表演
it may even change your performance

259
00:14:36,555 --> 00:14:39,015
因為這給拍電影帶來了完全不同的感受
Because it creates a different feelings in the whole thing

260
00:14:39,255 --> 00:14:42,042
這讓我們的創造性有了更多空間
It gives us more scope to be creative

261
00:14:42,043 --> 00:14:43,156

並發明了第一個CCD晶片
and the first CCD chip was created

270

<i>CCD的特點之一是
One of the things that makes the CCD unique</i>

In the mid of 1980s

284
00:15:52,140 --> 00:15:57,109
索尼生產了第一批消費型CCD可攜式攝影機
SONY was producing its first consumer quality CCD camcorders

285
00:15:57,109 --> 00:16:00,109
{\a6}哥本哈根，丹麥

286
00:15:59,584 --> 00:16:01,117
90年代
In the 1990s

287
00:16:01,118 --> 00:16:05,436
小型SD攝影機開始用於數位拍攝
small standard definition cameras began recording digitally

288
00:16:07,879 --> 00:16:09,644
它們開始用於電影拍攝
They were first to use cinematically

289
00:16:09,645 --> 00:16:14,123
始於在丹麥興起的“道格瑪95”運動
when they were embraced by the dogma 95 movement in Denmark

290
00:16:14,243 --> 00:16:15,822
您能不能談談
Can you speak a little bit about

291
00:16:15,823 --> 00:16:19,165
您是什麼時候開始使用數位…
Where did you first coming to digital…

292
00:16:19,165 --> 00:16:22,165
{\a6}拉斯 馮 提爾，導演
（白痴 / 反基督者 / 黑暗中漫舞）

293
00:16:19,165 --> 00:16:22,834
實際上是偶然
Actually it's by chance

294
00:16:22,835 --> 00:16:26,596
因為我們搞了個“道格瑪95”
Because we made this thing called dogma 95

295
00:16:27,088 --> 00:16:29,828
而且制定了一些規則
And we made up some rules

296
00:16:29,829 --> 00:16:31,576
其中一條是
And one of them was that

297
00:16:31,577 --> 00:16:36,300
必須使用35mm拍攝
the thing has to be filmed by academy 35mm

298
00:16:36,594 --> 00:16:37,755
接著另一條又說
And on e of them said

299
00:16:37,756 --> 00:16:40,541
必須是手持攝影機
it had to be hand-held camera also

300
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:42,494
然後我提議，既然如此
And then I said, if that is the case

301
00:16:42,495 --> 00:16:43,841
我們也能用錄影
we can also use video

302
00:16:44,769 --> 00:16:50,400
那時候又正好這些攝影機問世了
And that was just at the same time that these cameras came to appear

303
00:16:50,543 --> 00:16:54,584
安東尼 多德 曼妥是第一個拍攝“道格瑪95”的DP
Anthony Dod Mantle was the DP who shot the first dogma film

304
00:16:55,000 --> 00:16:57,507
<i>由湯瑪斯 溫特伯格執導的《家宴》
Thomas Winterberg‘s  celebration</i>

305
00:16:57,907 --> 00:17:03,712
(?)用數位拍攝還能保證電影的純粹性嗎？
(?)Was it pure also of digital video？

306
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:06,925
攝影機比較輕，這麼點重量不足以…
The lightness of the camera, the weight that you couldn't…

307
00:17:06,926 --> 00:17:09,154
我第一次用這個是這樣的：
I tell you it was the first hit me

308
00:17:09,155 --> 00:17:11,430
我去哥本哈根的農貿市場
I was coming up the food market in Copenhagen

309
00:17:11,430 --> 00:17:14,430
{\a6}安東尼 多德 曼特，攝影師
（那一個晚上 / 28天毀滅倒數 / 貧民百萬富翁）

310
00:17:11,618 --> 00:17:16,355
<i>我有台索尼PC3，就是我拍《那一個晚上》的那一台
I had a SONY PC 3 and that's the exact camera I end shooting celebration</i>

311
00:17:16,356 --> 00:17:20,813
我記起生機勃勃的擁擠場景
and I remember scenes crowd with lives

312
00:17:21,249 --> 00:17:25,568
假設我們穿過這樣工業化背景的地方
Supported us just moving across this field with a industrial backdrop

313
00:17:25,607 --> 00:17:28,161
有霧，模糊，這種感覺很哥特
Into mist and hazing, it's gothic

314
00:17:29,714 --> 00:17:31,432
我才開始學習怎麼用它
I was just learning how to play with it

315
00:17:31,433 --> 00:17:36,076
到處拍，對這小東西有種怪怪的感覺
Swept it around and I got this weird moment of this midgetcy

316
00:17:36,544 --> 00:17:38,680
又輕又小
Of lightness and midgetcy

317
00:17:38,681 --> 00:17:40,585
而當我看到畫面時又頗感震驚
and I looked at the image and said “my god”

318
00:17:40,586 --> 00:17:42,814
這可以是很好的攝影機
and that's gonna be nice cameras

319
00:17:42,915 --> 00:17:44,308
我認為
I called that

320
00:17:44,318 --> 00:17:47,318
{\a6}那一個晚上，1998

321
00:17:47,755 --> 00:17:50,820
<i>用微型攝影機拍攝《那一個晚上》有很多話可說
Too much say when I was shooting in celebration on the small cameras</i>

322
00:17:50,887 --> 00:17:53,024
<i>因為我想成為《那一個晚上》的主角
Casuse I want to be a protagonist on celebration</i>

323
00:17:56,778 --> 00:18:00,725
電影的構成實際上就是攝影機充滿情緒化的移動
The combination of the movie is actually emotional movements of the camera

324
00:18:00,742 --> 00:18:04,204
這決定了電影的視角
which probably defined that film's visual line

325
00:18:04,205 --> 00:18:05,622
應該把它與演員的表演
should depart them from the actors

326
00:18:05,623 --> 00:18:07,062
和劇本的指導分離開
and the watching great script

327
00:18:14,411 --> 00:18:17,615
用這台攝影機，這些問題迎刃而解
with that camera and I suddenly solve these smooth

328
00:18:17,595 --> 00:18:20,103
這種移動方式是從前的攝影經驗裡沒有的
it's possible movements I didn't know in my cinema

329
00:18:21,878 --> 00:18:24,896
<i>而這變成了我對《那一個晚上》的貢獻
And that became my donation for  celebration</i>

330
00:18:25,000 --> 00:18:26,532
<i>《那一個晚上》意味著什麼
What  celebration meant</i>

331
00:18:26,533 --> 00:18:30,000
其他這個領域的電影又意味著什麼
and what a lot of the other films at that area meant?

332
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:33,000
{\a6}白癡，1998

333
00:18:30,127 --> 00:18:35,421
是不是要完全重新思考電影製作的技術層面了呢
Was that you just have to completely rethink the technical side of the film making

334
00:18:33,001 --> 00:18:37,000
{\a6}敏郎悲歌，1999

335
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:39,786
這些電影讓人完全可以為了創意而創作
they brought people to film making for creativities sake

336
00:18:37,062 --> 00:18:40,000
{\a6}驢孩朱麗安，1999

337
00:18:40,062 --> 00:18:43,062
{\a6}國王不死，2000

338
00:18:42,402 --> 00:18:46,800
這些電影證明電影製作原理只是為創意服務而已
They pointed out that the mechanism of film making only serves creative

339
00:18:46,954 --> 00:18:49,954
{\a6}查克和貝克，2000

340
00:18:52,675 --> 00:18:54,208
用DV拍攝
With DV

341
00:18:54,208 --> 00:18:57,208
{\a6}傑森 科略特，製片
（查克和巴克 / 咖啡與香煙 / 索命麻醉）

342
00:18:54,347 --> 00:18:55,926
都是為了…
Came this whole idea of

343
00:18:55,927 --> 00:18:57,273
等等
wait a second

344
00:18:57,274 --> 00:18:59,687
要是我們能降低預算
if we lower our budgets

345
00:19:00,137 --> 00:19:04,410
作為導演和製片人來說就能有更大的自由度
we get more freedom as directors and producers

346
00:19:04,468 --> 00:19:08,137
用DV拍電影意味著這就是一坨屎
Shooting a film on video of that point meant it was crap

347
00:19:04,468 --> 00:19:07,468
{\a6}喬弗利 吉爾莫，電影節導演
（崔貝卡電影節 / 日舞電影節）

348
00:19:08,267 --> 00:19:13,097
這基本上是個難以接受的事實
It was almost unaccepted truth

349
00:19:13,098 --> 00:19:15,100
你並沒有認真拍電影
that you didn't shoot films

350
00:19:15,101 --> 00:19:19,320
因為那是錄影格式
that you're serious about on any kind of video format

351
00:19:19,424 --> 00:19:21,560
我們去那然後說：
We just started going out there and we are saying:

352
00:19:21,561 --> 00:19:23,975
聽著，我們要用數位拍攝
Look, we're gonna make movie digitally

353
00:19:23,976 --> 00:19:25,786
我們要做導演最終剪輯
we're gonna give director's final cut

354
00:19:26,159 --> 00:19:27,505
全程盡在掌握
Totally create of control

355
00:19:28,292 --> 00:19:29,685
不過我們會讓這一切更省錢
But we'll make them cheaper

356
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,136
<i>我們的第一部電影是《查克和巴克》
And our very first movie was chuck and buck</i>

357
00:19:32,147 --> 00:19:33,447
<i>你好啊貝克
Hey Buck</i>

358
00:19:33,612 --> 00:19:34,587
<i>…好呀
uh, Hi</i>

359
00:19:36,797 --> 00:19:38,329
<i>喝點啥嗎？
can I get you something to drink?</i>

360
00:19:38,505 --> 00:19:40,919
<i>不用，沒事
oh, no, that's alright</i>

361
00:19:41,147 --> 00:19:43,516
看重播會嚇到自己
Looking at rushes it will scary yourself

362
00:19:43,697 --> 00:19:45,044
<i>冰糕要嗎？
would you like some icecream?</i>

363
00:19:45,624 --> 00:19:50,030
<i>真的嗎，我愛冰糕耶
really? uh, I like icecream </i>

364
00:19:50,031 --> 00:19:51,888
天哪，看起來真夠業餘
Oh god, it looks so amateur

365
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:54,182
很多人其實…
A lot of people actually…

366
00:19:55,254 --> 00:19:57,854
都是模仿
come it on hell modeled it looked

367
00:19:57,855 --> 00:19:59,928
<i>你特嗎想什麼呢
what you're thinking you fucking doing, man</i>

368
00:20:00,126 --> 00:20:02,540
我記得我們把它在日舞上放映的情形
I remember when we presenting it on Sundance

369
00:20:02,541 --> 00:20:04,537
可嚇死他們了
they were scared to death

370
00:20:04,645 --> 00:20:07,339
觀影指南上寫的就是這是拿DV拍的
The direction would be “this was shot on video”

371
00:20:07,415 --> 00:20:11,224
這樣的數位元攝製作品作為
The digital presentation did not look nearly

372
00:20:11,698 --> 00:20:15,460
膠卷的替代品簡直難以接受
at any way gonna be acceptable substitute of what film was

373
00:20:15,461 --> 00:20:18,845
因為...色情片
Because of…porn

374
00:20:18,846 --> 00:20:20,610
還有紀錄片
And because of documentary

375
00:20:20,611 --> 00:20:21,864
還有新聞報導
and because of news footage

376
00:20:21,865 --> 00:20:25,532
小型攝影機影片讓你覺得：
Video occupied the space in your mind like:

377
00:20:25,691 --> 00:20:28,849
我在這，在這房間裡，天，一切真的在發生
I'm here I'm in that room oh my god, this is really happening

378
00:20:28,850 --> 00:20:31,000
<i>而這讓《查克和巴克》更好
And that makes chuck and buck better</i>

379
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:34,000
{\a6}艾倫 庫拉斯，攝影師
（迷途人生 / 王牌冤家 / 一世狂野）

380
00:20:31,001 --> 00:20:32,950
人們開始
People were starting to think

381
00:20:32,951 --> 00:20:35,226
用完全不同的眼光去審視
in a completely different way about

382
00:20:35,301 --> 00:20:37,809
技術和媒介
How could the technology and medium

383
00:20:37,879 --> 00:20:42,244
如何幫助我們重新思考電影製作
help us to rethink film making

384
00:20:43,000 --> 00:20:46,715
你發現人們開始挑戰傳統觀念
You start to see people start to challenge the idea

385
00:20:45,715 --> 00:20:48,715
{\a6}迷途人生，2002

386
00:20:46,716 --> 00:20:49,826
像InDigEnt（獨立數位娛樂）這樣的組織
as the group as InDigEnt (Independent Digital Entertainment )

387
00:20:50,727 --> 00:20:54,024
他們製作SD影片
They were creating standard def video

388
00:20:54,141 --> 00:20:59,343
然後用影片拼成電影再放出
That within they converted to film for seen actual released

389
00:20:59,343 --> 00:21:02,343
{\a6}蓋瑞 文尼克，InDigEnt創始人（已故）

390
00:20:59,344 --> 00:21:01,053
作為一個獨立電影人
I think as a independent film maker

391
00:21:01,054 --> 00:21:03,978
我認為我們正處於最令人興奮的時代
we are at the most exciting time ever

392
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:08,040
因為現在我們能出去用DV拍攝電影
Because now we can go out and make a film on DV

393
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,440
{\a6}蝌蚪，2002

394
00:21:08,584 --> 00:21:10,534
<i>奧斯卡交了新女友
Oscar has a new girlfriend</i>

395
00:21:11,354 --> 00:21:12,468
<i>真的嗎
really? </i>

396
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:16,715
<i>我們昨天好像討論了很長時間這個話題了
it seems last day we get quite late for that conversation</i>

397
00:21:17,181 --> 00:21:21,361
有種想法是你要是用數位拍那就一定便宜
The idea was that if you shoot digitally it was cheap

398
00:21:21,512 --> 00:21:25,738
所以徹底的幫助提升了電影製作的數量
And absolutely helped fill the number of movies that gotten make

399
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,136
我記得我在日舞的頭一年
I remember my first year on Sundance

400
00:21:28,301 --> 00:21:32,806
在虛構作品類中我們遣返了35部提交作品
we return 35 submissions total of the fiction category

401
00:21:33,103 --> 00:21:35,379
幾年以後就翻了10倍
few years later it was 10 times of that

402
00:21:35,380 --> 00:21:38,145
在聖誕斯電影節上
back to that Sundance days

403
00:21:38,200 --> 00:21:45,354
有InDigEnt的作品，人們都覺得還好，畢竟是獨立作品
the releases of InDigEnt, people were saying that's ok for you as independent

404
00:21:40,040 --> 00:21:43,040
{\a6}卡羅林 卡普蘭，製片
（誘惑我小媽 / 迷途人生 / 非關女孩）

405
00:21:45,402 --> 00:21:47,910
不過這不是電影
But this isn't cinema this isn't…

406
00:21:48,443 --> 00:21:53,644
這種說法很流行，用DV做電影再去日舞
That was a huge saying to make film on a video camera and go to Sundance

407
00:21:53,645 --> 00:21:57,624
<i>我們因《迷途人生》贏得了最佳導演和最佳影片
And win best director, and win beat film for personal velocity</i>

408
00:21:57,900 --> 00:22:00,036
<i>蓋瑞自己的《蝌蚪》
Gary's own film tadpole</i>

409
00:22:00,037 --> 00:22:02,637
就比較傾向於大眾
And being sort of for normal man's money

410
00:22:02,638 --> 00:22:05,330
每個人都在努力：娛樂大眾好賺錢
Everyone worked on it: make money from that sale

411
00:22:05,603 --> 00:22:11,548
這就是大家都覺得用數位攝影沒問題的時候
And that's when a lot of the idea you can shoot film digitally

412
00:22:11,860 --> 00:22:14,229
就像是對商品美學的品頭論足
And it's almost like a production aesthetic

413
00:22:14,535 --> 00:22:16,393
爭論開始了
And that's when all those debates started

414
00:22:16,425 --> 00:22:18,685
您一定知道
You must have heard that late 90s

415
00:22:18,686 --> 00:22:22,911
90年代末電影的金標準和您使用的工具是什麼呢
film's gold standard and the tool you playing with are what?

416
00:22:22,912 --> 00:22:24,885
貶低或推崇
debasing, fattening

417
00:22:25,574 --> 00:22:27,711
我曾經受過打擊…
I have been slapped around if you wanna…

418
00:22:27,712 --> 00:22:28,779
“打擊”是怎麼回事
What do you mean “slapped around”？

419
00:22:28,780 --> 00:22:33,559
(?)我被說成是個爆發同性戀
(?)I mean I've been exploded and homosexualcated for the sentence

420
00:22:33,873 --> 00:22:37,217
對我來說轉投數位攝影是顯然的
It was a quite obvious to me to go to digital

421
00:22:37,218 --> 00:22:41,907
因為你可以熟練使用攝影機
because of mature you can have the camera

422
00:22:41,908 --> 00:22:44,843
這種成熟程度顯而易見
The amount of the mature you can have your camera was obvious

423
00:22:45,783 --> 00:22:50,287
既然我決定用另一種工作方式創作
since I was trying to create another way of working with other tools

424
00:22:50,734 --> 00:22:52,313
這點是比較重要的
And that was essential

425
00:22:52,406 --> 00:22:55,406
{\a6}大衛 林區，導演
（藍絲絨 / 象人 / 穆赫蘭大道）

426
00:22:52,406 --> 00:22:54,914
為了拍長鏡頭
I imagine there was collaboration for you than

427
00:22:54,915 --> 00:22:58,731
我猜您需要和演員密切合作是嗎
terms of the relationship with your actors for longer takes？

428
00:22:58,870 --> 00:23:01,006
是啊，基努
Yes you know, Keanu

429
00:23:01,290 --> 00:23:04,587
10分鐘到頭了，其實根本沒10分鐘
10-minute is maximum, it wasn't really 10

430
00:23:04,588 --> 00:23:05,980
9分鐘吧也就
9 or something

431
00:23:06,257 --> 00:23:08,700
當那玩意開始轉的時候
When that thing starts rolling

432
00:23:09,425 --> 00:23:11,747
有種感覺
There's kina underline feeling

433
00:23:11,748 --> 00:23:14,700
寶貝開始轉了
that precious stuff rolling through there

434
00:23:14,872 --> 00:23:18,309
這讓所有東西都緊張
And it puts kind of a tension on things

435
00:23:18,310 --> 00:23:20,677
我想拍多長拍多長
Like a shoot as much as I wanted

436
00:23:20,678 --> 00:23:22,303
我可以有最好的表演
I can get the best performances

437
00:23:22,304 --> 00:23:25,600
我不用擔心拍片是燒膠卷
I didn't have to worry about shooting is a little burst of film

438
00:23:25,601 --> 00:23:27,423
這太荒謬了，不過我曾經就是這麼擔心的
That was ridiculous but that was what I had to do

439
00:23:27,424 --> 00:23:30,581
相對來說曾經就是那麼貴
that's how expensive it was comparatively

440
00:23:31,420 --> 00:23:36,017
數位攝影的話，一個小東西能拍40分鐘
Digital, a little gizmo, 40 minutes

441
00:23:36,018 --> 00:23:39,732
你能邊拍
And you can be running this camera

442
00:23:39,733 --> 00:23:42,008
邊和演員講話
and talking to the actor

443
00:23:42,009 --> 00:23:43,865
再來也沒問題
Starting over again

444
00:23:50,786 --> 00:23:52,690
他們能夠融入進去
And they get down in there

445
00:23:52,691 --> 00:23:55,940
能抓拍以前的巨型設備
And catch a thing never would get caught

446
00:23:55,941 --> 00:23:58,820
幾乎從來沒拍到過的東西
if you have the giant thing there

447
00:23:58,820 --> 00:24:01,820
{\a6}達尼爾 馬丁，導演
（藍調傳奇 / 拉丁情事 / Prison Song)

448
00:23:58,821 --> 00:24:00,558
我喜歡用攝影機工作
I love to on the camera

449
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:04,587
尤其是到感情洋溢的地方，魔法就發生了
Especially when we were at the emotional place that magic is happening

450
00:24:04,588 --> 00:24:08,453
你喊停的時候，突然間所有人都去那了
When you go cut, That all of a sudden everybody's in there

451
00:24:08,454 --> 00:24:13,118
而你就在那
And you were at a place where it is just there

452
00:24:13,119 --> 00:24:14,604
接著萬物靜止
And then everything stops

453
00:24:14,605 --> 00:24:16,045
接著是“好了，我們繼續”
then “that's ok, now go back to that”

454
00:24:16,046 --> 00:24:18,460
而我說：“等等，要搞下攝影機，一分鐘就好”
And I said “no, just went to the camera, back to one”

455
00:24:21,817 --> 00:24:25,857
你要能夠快歸位
As fast as you can get back to your position

456
00:24:22,867 --> 00:24:25,867
{\a6}約翰 馬可維奇，演員
（危險關係 / 太陽帝國 / 超危險特工）

457
00:24:26,145 --> 00:24:27,678
你還能再次離開
You can go again

458
00:24:28,406 --> 00:24:31,610
我就是覺得等待的時間好多啊
I just thought there was way too much waiting

459
00:24:31,611 --> 00:24:35,755
電影於我總有個動力問題
Because movies for me there is always momentum problem

460
00:24:35,755 --> 00:24:40,904
因為我成長於劇院，那也是我接受表演訓練的地方
Cause I grow up in the theater and that's how I was trained

461
00:24:40,905 --> 00:24:43,133
不過在拍電影的大多數時間我…
and a lot of time in movies I…

462
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:46,174
總有種感覺：“我們能走了嗎？”
feel like “can we go？”

463
00:24:46,619 --> 00:24:50,520
對我來說連拍45分鐘簡直太難了
it‘s very tough for me to be able to shoot 45 minutes

464
00:24:50,521 --> 00:24:51,887
不是攝影機換膠卷的問題
Not reload of the cameras

465
00:24:51,888 --> 00:24:55,000
因為整個團隊都不能再集中精神
Because it's true this entire group can't get on concentrate

466
00:24:55,001 --> 00:24:59,272
演員就能集中那麼久，所以你需要2-3分鐘的休息
The actors can only concentrate for so long and you need 2-min-break, 3-min-break

467
00:24:59,273 --> 00:25:00,757
正好換膠卷
during which time you reload

468
00:25:00,762 --> 00:25:02,759
當你用膠卷攝影機拍攝的時候
When you're running a film camera on sight

469
00:25:02,760 --> 00:25:05,917
每個人都比較嚴肅
everyone seems to take things a little bit more seriously

470
00:25:06,271 --> 00:25:07,989
當他們聽見膠卷轉的時候
When they hear the film running

471
00:25:07,990 --> 00:25:10,713
其實基本上聽見的都是錢的聲音
they hear the money running on the camera basically

472
00:25:10,714 --> 00:25:12,524
每個人都全神貫注
Everybody brings an aim

473
00:25:16,878 --> 00:25:22,915
我頭次聽說攝影機裡有膠卷在轉的時候
The first time I'd ever heard the word a film going through a camera

474
00:25:18,800 --> 00:25:21,800
{\a6}格蕾塔 葛韋格，演員
（愛上草食男 / 阿舍正傳 / 飯飯之交）

475
00:25:24,106 --> 00:25:27,960
又興奮又緊張
It was thrilling also make me very nervous because

476
00:25:28,277 --> 00:25:35,475
因為突然間每一幀都要算錢，而我以前從未經歷過
All of a sudden each take counted in a way that I never really experienced before

477
00:25:35,476 --> 00:25:37,472
在你喊“開始”的瞬間感覺如何
what about that moment after you say “action”

478
00:25:37,473 --> 00:25:39,701
比如對我來說，攝影機開始工作
Like for me, when that cameras rolling

479
00:25:39,702 --> 00:25:41,466
我猜肯定是和錢有聯繫，不過
I guess maybe it's connected to the money but...

480
00:25:41,467 --> 00:25:43,881
10分鐘也太有限了
the 10-minute reel is so finite

481
00:25:43,882 --> 00:25:47,178
這簡直就像競技體育，你得集中再集中..
It's almost athletic thing like focus, focus…

482
00:25:43,882 --> 00:25:46,882
{\a6}理查 林克萊特，導演
（心機掃描 / 都市浪人 / 年少輕狂）

483
00:25:48,538 --> 00:25:52,485
然後，“嗯這個不錯”這樣
Like that's good for them

484
00:25:52,486 --> 00:25:54,381
其實就是個氣氛
that's just atmosphere though

485
00:25:55,295 --> 00:25:57,476
我的意思是，你要是那麼想肯定感覺的到
I mean if you want that you can create that, right

486
00:25:57,476 --> 00:26:00,476
{\a6}丹尼 鮑爾，導演
（海灘 / 28天毀滅倒數 / 貧民百萬富翁）

487
00:25:57,477 --> 00:25:59,380
我覺得演員的情況會不一樣
I thought it could make a difference through actors

488
00:25:59,381 --> 00:26:00,970
不用給一堆第二次拍攝機會
Don't give a dozen particularly twice

489
00:26:00,971 --> 00:26:06,447
我可以不斷的調整到他們覺得合適
I Just infinitely give adjust whatever way they have to tell it they'll tell it

490
00:26:06,448 --> 00:26:09,698
你不會暫停也不說：“嘿，能停了嗎”
You didn't ask for a break you didn't say:”hey, can we stop”

491
00:26:09,699 --> 00:26:11,973
你現在用的是數位攝影嗎？--沒錯
You are on digital now -- yeah

492
00:26:11,974 --> 00:26:16,292
我第一次經歷到沒有暫停的拍攝是
Though my first experience is, without which is, there is no cut

493
00:26:16,849 --> 00:26:20,054
<i>和理查 林克萊特合作的《心機掃描》
I worked with Richard Linklater on the film called Scanner Darkly</i>

494
00:26:20,055 --> 00:26:22,183
就像--你繼續吧
It just lik -- you can just go on

495
00:26:22,184 --> 00:26:24,737
對，我哀求道“我們停下來吧”
Yeah, I just like “can we please stop”

496
00:26:25,615 --> 00:26:26,637
停下吧~
Stop~

497
00:26:27,828 --> 00:26:29,175
不，沒那必要
No, we don't have to

498
00:26:29,176 --> 00:26:30,847
但是我想停下來啊！
But I want to！

499
00:26:32,318 --> 00:26:35,708
羅伯特唐尼找到我說：
Robert Downey actually came up to me, and he said:

500
00:26:35,709 --> 00:26:37,333
“這樣工作我不行的
“I can't work like this,

501
00:26:37,334 --> 00:26:40,360
“我找不到我的拖車，我從來也沒整理過自己的東西
“I never get to my trailer, I never get my shit together

502
00:26:40,361 --> 00:26:43,685
“我一天站14個小時，我一直在拍啊拍啊。”
“I'm on my feet 14 hours a day, I'm shooting all the time.”

503
00:26:43,686 --> 00:26:48,998
他把盛尿的石頭罐子放片場了
He actually left mason jars of urine on the set

504
00:26:49,186 --> 00:26:50,765
就放角落裡
Just like over in the corner stuff

505
00:26:50,766 --> 00:26:52,832
他會出去尿完了再放回來
just he will go off and pee in it and bring it back

506
00:26:52,833 --> 00:26:54,968
拿這個跟我抗議
this is like a form of protest

507
00:26:55,819 --> 00:27:00,570
以前，用賽璐珞拍片真的好興奮啊
Previously, what's on celluloid only really has been thrilled

508
00:27:00,563 --> 00:27:04,082
那種獲得賽璐珞聖杯的感覺，很神奇
to arrive a holy grail of celluloid, it's amazing

509
00:27:04,083 --> 00:27:05,800
所以我們的頭幾部電影是用賽璐珞拍的
so we made the first few films on celluloid

510
00:27:05,801 --> 00:27:07,936
而且我做了道不錯的好萊塢大餐
and I made a very big of Hollywood film

511
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:09,224
<i>《海灘》
the beach</i>

512
00:27:09,224 --> 00:27:12,224
{\a6}海灘，2000

513
00:27:09,225 --> 00:27:12,243
和李奧納多狄卡皮歐，還有很大的一個工作團隊
with Leonardo Di Caprio, and a big crew

514
00:27:12,244 --> 00:27:13,776
不過這一點也不適合我
and it didn't suit me at all

515
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,761
感覺擔子實在太重
I felt it was too much weight for me really somehow

516
00:27:17,762 --> 00:27:21,393
<i>接下來我看到了《那一個晚上》
And so I then saw celebration</i>

517
00:27:21,393 --> 00:27:24,143
{\a6}那一個晚上，1998

518
00:27:24,239 --> 00:27:27,118
不像電影，也不像眼見
wasn't so much the film, wasn't even a look

519
00:27:27,119 --> 00:27:29,486
單純的攝影機操作
It was the camera operating

520
00:27:29,487 --> 00:27:31,205
和攝影移動
Movement of the camera

521
00:27:33,239 --> 00:27:36,954
所以我找到拍攝它的人：安東尼 多德 曼特
So I got with the guy who shot it, Anthony Dod Mantle

522
00:27:36,955 --> 00:27:40,948
我覺得像是離經叛道
And I said I feel like not doing the right thing any more

523
00:27:41,000 --> 00:27:44,338
“我們一起做點什麼吧，用數位攝影”
“Can we do something together, Digitally”

524
00:27:44,339 --> 00:27:47,914
我都不知道自己在說啥，不過覺得像個新世界
which I didn't know what I ‘m saying by saying that It was kind like a new world anyway

525
00:27:47,915 --> 00:27:50,608
<i>接著我們就著手製作《28天毀滅倒數》
Then we came with the script 28 days later</i>

526
00:27:50,899 --> 00:27:53,899
{\a6}28天毀滅倒數，2002

527
00:27:51,459 --> 00:27:53,595
這是我們用消費型攝影機拍的
And we shot it on consumer cameras

528
00:27:54,691 --> 00:27:56,548
但是我記得安東尼對我說過
But I remember Anthony saying to me

529
00:27:56,549 --> 00:28:02,028
這個格式沒問題的，不過我們這輩子也沒法得奧斯卡了
It's all vey well working in this format and he said we'll never get an Oscar

530
00:28:03,327 --> 00:28:07,320
開始的時候有個場景，斯里安墨菲要演的
There was a scene in the beginning what the character Cillian Murphy wanted it run

531
00:28:07,321 --> 00:28:08,806
荒廢的倫敦
A deserted London

532
00:28:11,041 --> 00:28:13,874
要是用膠卷，這片子怕是無法完成
We will not be able to achieve the film on film

533
00:28:13,875 --> 00:28:16,893
因為我們沒那麼多錢去阻斷交通
Because we have to stop the traffic and we did not get enough money to do it

534
00:28:16,894 --> 00:28:19,911
所以我們只是短暫的管制了一下交通
So what we do is just hold the traffic briefly

535
00:28:19,912 --> 00:28:23,394
但是因為我們是用這些攝影機拍的，能用10個一起拍
But because we run these cameras, we could use ten of them

536
00:28:23,395 --> 00:28:24,462
因為太便宜了
cause it's so cheap

537
00:28:25,584 --> 00:28:28,927
而且他可以走過倫敦中心和其他區域
and he can walk through central London and areas of it

538
00:28:28,928 --> 00:28:32,457
我們有10台攝影機，只要交通停止幾分鐘就行
We have 10 cameras of that, so you only have to stop the traffic for a few minutes

539
00:28:32,458 --> 00:28:34,779
接著就有10個拍攝畫面了
Then you would actually have 10 shots

540
00:28:34,779 --> 00:28:36,961
這可是一大進步
That was enormous advantage

541
00:28:37,302 --> 00:28:39,253
我們拿攝影機到處轉
We plays cameras around

542
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,817
不是隨機的、壞的、漫無目的的
Not coinciding not badly not loosely

543
00:28:41,818 --> 00:28:44,371
我試圖控制每個角度而且我知道哪些更好
I tried to control every angle and I know what few ways is best

544
00:28:44,705 --> 00:28:45,959
用哪個更好
What's gonna be used

545
00:28:46,218 --> 00:28:50,212
不過之前可以任意看，來獲得新的設想
But that said you can let anyone there, and have a little new guesses there

546
00:28:50,596 --> 00:28:53,429
你是在拍有很小人像的廣角鏡頭
You are in a wide shot with small figures in it

547
00:28:53,669 --> 00:28:56,030
也就2-3個圖元
They were just like 2-3 pixels

548
00:28:56,031 --> 00:28:57,748
我是說那幾乎啥也沒有，就是顏色而已
I mean there's nothing there, they were just color

549
00:28:58,127 --> 00:29:01,843
顏色是比較明智的做法，要是同質拷貝到膠卷上
color is wise if you put it up against exact copy of they were on film

550
00:29:01,844 --> 00:29:03,607
那這張膠卷會巨大無比
The film will be imagerily superior

551
00:29:03,823 --> 00:29:08,188
不過你卻可以偷著拍，代替性的拍，不讓人知道
But you can shoot illegally, substitutedly without people knowing

552
00:29:08,189 --> 00:29:10,046
你可以不照套路出牌
You could do unconventional things

553
00:29:10,047 --> 00:29:13,714
這時影片的節奏
And the rhythm of film which is passed on since it began

554
00:29:13,848 --> 00:29:15,195
(?)鏡頭的連續
(?)Cruise of lens

555
00:29:15,196 --> 00:29:17,471
就都被打斷了,我喜歡這種自由感
You interrupted that, I love that freedom

556
00:29:17,472 --> 00:29:21,511
所以嘗到甜頭後，我知道這樣的設計要怎麼做了
And I got taste for it then, I knew which way to chalk that sequence

557
00:29:22,143 --> 00:29:25,069
所以我正在做這件事，而結果也和我想要的一樣
so I was gonna work on it now, that wasI want it to work

558
00:29:27,381 --> 00:29:34,626
這讓剪輯的工作變得特別（繁雜），因為常常有大量的資料湧入
It makes the editor's job extraordinary cause it's often plumbing through Masses and masses and
masses material

559
00:29:35,407 --> 00:29:37,265
70-80年代
In the 1970s and 80s

560
00:29:37,256 --> 00:29:42,188
電氣公司開始著手可以取代膠卷剪輯的解決方案
electronics companies began working on solutions to replace film editing

561
00:29:42,835 --> 00:29:48,494
100多年來，剪輯人員都是手動剪切粘貼膠卷的
For over 100 years, editing man physically cutting and connecting pieces of film

562
00:29:48,622 --> 00:29:50,852
我們以前常去剪輯室
we used to go to the editing room

563
00:29:50,836 --> 00:29:52,787
他們把膠卷抽到剪切盒裡
they were rolling them into the trim basket

564
00:29:53,081 --> 00:29:56,939
把現在的膠卷放到滾動軸上
they took the film now, and put that through the moving roll

565
00:29:57,093 --> 00:30:00,093
{\a6}湯姆 羅斯曼，福克斯影業首席CEO

566
00:29:57,093 --> 00:29:58,579
然後像這樣啪啪的把他們粘到一起
and you slap it together like this

567
00:29:58,580 --> 00:30:01,691
那些戴白手套的幹這個難以置信的快
you remember the white gloves and they're incredibly fast at it

568
00:30:01,692 --> 00:30:08,378
我摸到（膠卷）邊緣，有時候很鋒利，會把手指割出血
I find a frame and Sometimes blazing and get your fingertips bloodied

569
00:30:08,379 --> 00:30:10,241
這可是真的“電影上的血”啊
that's just really the blood in the film

570
00:30:10,242 --> 00:30:14,049
我是說真的血，不過現在這一切都變成神奇小按鈕了
So I mean really had it and now it's fascinating buttons

571
00:30:14,094 --> 00:30:16,230
<i>這是一張大家都熟悉的軟碟...
now this is the floppy disk we all familiar…</i>

572
00:30:16,259 --> 00:30:19,696
早期的剪輯系統使用可塑磁碟
early editing systems use moldable magnetic disks

573
00:30:19,697 --> 00:30:21,739
磁帶機和雷射光碟
tape machines and laser disks

574
00:30:21,740 --> 00:30:24,433
來儲存並讀取數位化的膠卷
to store and read digitaled of film

575
00:30:24,449 --> 00:30:27,653
這些系統大多特別貴
most of the systems are enormously very costly

576
00:30:27,856 --> 00:30:30,856
{\a6}費爾 曼休斯，攝影師
（皇家賭場 / 蒙面俠蘇洛 / 將計就計）

577
00:30:27,856 --> 00:30:32,221
我想後來改變一切的第一件事應該是我知道了剪輯機器
the first thing I have read that changed everything I think it was the digital editing machine

578
00:30:32,712 --> 00:30:35,545
可以花一天把膠卷變成影帶
which spend a daily set and converted film into tape

579
00:30:36,400 --> 00:30:38,954
所以一切從這開始
so that's started the whole thing going

580
00:30:40,110 --> 00:30:43,639
我們研發了一台全數位化的圖像剪輯系統
we start a picture editing system that was all digital

581
00:30:43,771 --> 00:30:46,771
{\a6} “editdroid”剪輯系統

582
00:30:43,771 --> 00:30:47,672
我們的第一台editdroid在1980年開始工作
we had the first “editdroid” working in 1980

583
00:30:48,338 --> 00:30:51,542
我們最後把它賣給了AVID
and we eventually sold the system to AVID

584
00:30:51,825 --> 00:30:53,264
80年代末
by the late 1980s

585
00:30:53,265 --> 00:30:59,534
AVID把數位剪輯發展成了密集型、有償高效、全電腦控制的系統
AVID had developed digital editing into a compacted cost-effective computer-based system

586
00:30:59,781 --> 00:31:02,411
我第一次看到AVID的時候
when I first saw the AVID

587
00:30:59,781 --> 00:31:02,781
{\a6}葛列格 伍德，剪輯
（神鬼奇航 / 浪人47 / 午夜凶鈴）

588
00:31:02,782 --> 00:31:07,800
我看見又小又灰暗的圖像在裡面
I have a dimmer image quality was block in, tiny

589
00:31:07,811 --> 00:31:13,013
然後我說，這個要是在五年時間內能把圖像品質提高就好了
and I said: this is gonna be really good if they give the image quality right about in 5 years time

590
00:31:13,013 --> 00:31:16,013
{\a6}沃特 默奇，剪輯
（現代啟示錄 / 英倫情人 /冷山）

591
00:31:13,013 --> 00:31:14,532
為什麼不試試AVID
why not try it on the AVID

592
00:31:14,533 --> 00:31:17,706
我也是最早那批採用者之一
I'm also one of the earlier adopter people

593
00:31:17,707 --> 00:31:19,876
我喜歡探索未知世界
I like to leap into the unknown

594
00:31:22,342 --> 00:31:24,896
<i>我記得做《英倫情人》的時候
I remember on the English patient</i>

595
00:31:24,897 --> 00:31:31,955
我看著它的畫面說：“天啊，我要怎麼做啊”
I look at in the images and “no, how I'm gonna to be able to do this?”

596
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:35,220
{\a6}德里克 安布羅西，剪輯
（超急快遞）

597
00:31:32,220 --> 00:31:35,564
我和老一輩的剪輯一起工作時
when I work with elder editors

598
00:31:35,565 --> 00:31:39,419
他們總是提起電腦剛剛被被用到這項工作上的時候
they'll often to talk about the time when computers were starting to come in

599
00:31:39,932 --> 00:31:44,297
他們對此比較抵觸，因為他們不熟悉電腦
and they were very resistant to it because they weren't familiar with computers

600
00:31:44,409 --> 00:31:48,124
他們害怕因為對電腦瞭解不夠
they were just scared that they didn't know enough about it

601
00:31:48,125 --> 00:31:54,440
可能導致不小心按錯鍵或是意外關機開機，然後啥都沒了
if you push that button or if you accidentally turn it off wrong or turn it on wrong that everything will
be gone

602
00:31:54,441 --> 00:31:58,527
但你要是拿手去做這些情況不可能發生
while that could never happen if you actually physically have the film in your hand

603
00:31:58,528 --> 00:32:00,941
他們覺得自己根本就沒在剪輯，剪輯其實是…
they thought that was not editing, editing is…

604
00:32:02,072 --> 00:32:04,951
不管膠卷怎麼剪輯
so when you're editing the movie on film

605
00:32:04,952 --> 00:32:07,598
都是技術而已，而藝術
that's just technology, the art form

606
00:32:07,599 --> 00:32:10,570
是透過畫面來說故事
is the manipulation of images to tell a story

607
00:32:10,570 --> 00:32:13,570
{\a6}安 科茲，剪輯
（阿拉伯的勞倫斯 / 永不妥協 / 黃金羅盤）

608
00:32:10,571 --> 00:32:13,032
操作起來挺難的
it was extremely difficult major that

609
00:32:13,365 --> 00:32:16,709
因為我以前沒用過電腦
because I haven't used a computer

610
00:32:16,961 --> 00:32:21,366
我見過老鼠（滑鼠）到處跑，不過可不是在剪輯室
I've seen a mouse somewhere across the floor but not in the editing room

611
00:32:21,652 --> 00:32:26,269
不過我學了，還用了很長一段時間
but I learnt and I keep the machine quite a bit

612
00:32:26,270 --> 00:32:29,693
不過不用電腦我也無所謂，我也喜歡這樣
but once I don't doing on it that's ok and I like it

613
00:32:29,712 --> 00:32:31,644
剪輯處沒有膠卷
there's no film in the editing bay

614
00:32:32,000 --> 00:32:33,780
一切都
it's all…

615
00:32:35,433 --> 00:32:38,594
{\a6}克里斯 萊本森
（愛麗絲夢遊仙境 / 世界末日 / 捍衛戰士）

616
00:32:35,433 --> 00:32:36,594
一切都好安靜
it's quite

617
00:32:36,595 --> 00:32:38,767
我聽不見以前常聽見的“rururu”的聲音
I don't hear I used to hear the “rururu…”

618
00:32:38,768 --> 00:32:41,228
就是工作臺上的卷軸發出的
the reel on the benches

619
00:32:41,229 --> 00:32:44,897
一直都是非常吵雜的工作環境
it was very noisy kind of buzzing atmosphere

620
00:32:45,130 --> 00:32:52,560
不過現在特別安靜，好像所有的聲音都能像蠟燭一樣被燒掉
and now it's very quite, almost like that you can burn any sound like candles

621
00:32:55,116 --> 00:32:58,367
數位技術把事情變得高效
digital bring you the speed and almost

622
00:32:58,552 --> 00:33:03,570
不過同時也在挑戰你：“我能想那麼快嗎？”
challenge you the sense of “can I think that fast”

623
00:33:03,812 --> 00:33:05,623
“我有時間喘氣嗎”
“do I need time to breathe?”

624
00:33:06,242 --> 00:33:10,979
有時年輕的剪輯總是充滿興趣，還做著非常有趣的工作
sometime are young editors are over-interesting and doing extremely interesting work

625
00:33:10,980 --> 00:33:16,923
但他們不總是有時間安靜坐下來並思考自己到底在做什麼
but they don't always have the time to sit back and think about what they are doing

626
00:33:17,592 --> 00:33:19,961
不過我想他們要是用膠卷來工作
and I think if they work on film

627
00:33:19,962 --> 00:33:24,001
就必須要訓練他們的思想來實現這點
they probably have to train their mind to do that

628
00:33:24,511 --> 00:33:26,973
真的是另一種思考方式
so it's a different way of thinking, really

629
00:33:27,084 --> 00:33:29,731
膠卷用條條框框折磨你
film torture you with discipline

630
00:33:29,732 --> 00:33:32,732
{\a6}持攝影機的人，1929

631
00:33:29,909 --> 00:33:33,439
用電腦的話就沒那麼痛苦了
that it's gone a little bit from the computer

632
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:36,013
因為一旦你動了剪子
because you once put the scissors in

633
00:33:36,364 --> 00:33:39,052
就得拿膠布再粘起來
you've been got to join it back with sticky tape

634
00:33:39,136 --> 00:33:41,400
再連到機器上
and bond it through the machine

635
00:33:41,401 --> 00:33:43,230
這個過程你是關鍵
you're much more decisive about that

636
00:33:44,331 --> 00:33:45,956
剪輯過程變更好了嗎？
has editing got any better?

637
00:33:46,151 --> 00:33:48,705
就因為選擇變多了？我覺得不一定
because it's infinite the choice? I'm not so sure

638
00:33:47,705 --> 00:33:50,705
{\a6}洛倫佐 狄波納文圖拉，製片
（變形金剛 / 特務間諜 /  驚天換日）

639
00:33:49,130 --> 00:33:51,916
不過有件事情比較肯定，現在的很多電影更爛了
but I'm pretty sure that a lot of movies are getting worse

640
00:33:52,542 --> 00:33:56,768
因為你將它推向死亡
because you manipulate it to death

641
00:33:57,502 --> 00:33:58,456
我們會失去很多東西
we may lost something

642
00:33:58,771 --> 00:34:03,554
<i>《阿拉伯的勞倫斯》中，當他劃亮火柴
the cutting that Lawrence of Arabia when he blows the match up</i>

643
00:34:03,750 --> 00:34:07,466
<i>看得出來您有著有趣的幽默感
this is recognized that you have a funny sense of fun</i>

644
00:34:07,668 --> 00:34:09,758
這只是寫在劇本裡
that was the solving script

645
00:34:09,845 --> 00:34:12,956
不過要是有我們今天的數位技術
and if you've been on digital as we have on that today

646
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:15,832
看准就行了
you just have to see it

647
00:34:16,117 --> 00:34:19,229
不過那時候，電影都是一段一段粘起來的
in those days, the film were bonded together like that

648
00:34:19,230 --> 00:34:20,668
就靠剪輯
just with the direct cut

649
00:34:21,140 --> 00:34:24,809
所以當我們看到這個，我們都驚呼不可思議
so when we saw it, we got “wow, that's fantastic”

650
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:28,872
想想吧，當時那種感情
just work it, just imagine it, when you feel that feeling

651
00:34:30,727 --> 00:34:37,136
作為影像和聲音的承載體，數位擁有不可思議的可塑性
digital is unbelievably malleable plastic of imatery and sound

652
00:34:37,137 --> 00:34:39,969
這很有吸引力，因為我們要的就是可塑性
and that's seductive, because that's all we do

653
00:34:39,970 --> 00:34:44,245
我們是圖像和聲音的雕塑者
we are sculptors of images and sound

654
00:34:44,246 --> 00:34:46,149
不是說膠卷就做不了
it's not that you can't do it in film

655
00:34:46,304 --> 00:34:51,923
就是操作麻煩，而且想做好很難
it's just harder to do that and make it look good

656
00:34:53,872 --> 00:34:56,798
在數位技術不斷發展的同時
as digital technology continued to grow

657
00:34:56,799 --> 00:35:00,188
電腦生成圖像，及通常說的CGI
computer generated images or CGI

658
00:35:00,387 --> 00:35:03,035
越來越多的出現在電影中
were appearing more and more in movies

659
00:35:03,050 --> 00:35:06,050
{\a6}大都會，1927

660
00:35:05,668 --> 00:35:08,362
視覺特效，或VFX
visul FX or VFX (Visual Special Effects)

661
00:35:08,365 --> 00:35:11,891
自電影成長初期起就成為了電影製作的一部分
have been part of film making since the earliest years

662
00:35:11,891 --> 00:35:14,891
35:11
{\a6}伊阿宋與金羊毛，1963

663
00:35:12,806 --> 00:35:17,683
攝影技巧，燈光技術，精細模型和實驗室操作
camera tricks, lighting techniques, elaborate models and lab processes

664
00:35:14,892 --> 00:35:17,892
{\a6}第三類接觸，1977

665
00:35:17,859 --> 00:35:22,689
都被用作改變真實並提高電影體驗
have all been used to alter realty and enhance the movie going experience

666

{\a6}奪寶奇兵：法櫃奇兵，1981

667
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:26,020
{\a6}星際迷航2，1982

668
00:35:23,306 --> 00:35:26,975
好多電影都不是想拍就拍的
on many films that the number is unpredicted you can't go out and shoot

669
00:35:26,976 --> 00:35:31,549
所以那些你想要的畫面就只能想辦法製作
so the images you need to see you need to be manufactory in somewhere

670
00:35:28,383 --> 00:35:31,383
{\a6}約翰 科諾，工業光魔視覺特效總監
（阿凡達 / 神鬼奇航 / 星際大戰1-3）

671
00:35:31,549 --> 00:35:34,549
{\a6}帝國反擊戰，1980

672
00:35:32,655 --> 00:35:35,953
作為視覺特效總監你得明白
things of visual FX supervisor called on you to understand

673
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:39,000
{\a6}提姆 韋伯，FrameStone 視覺特效總監
（阿凡達 / 黑暗騎士 / 人類之子）

674
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:40,458
你得瞭解到這個世界的時時刻刻方方面面
a huge variety of different aspect of the world around us at any one time

675
00:35:40,482 --> 00:35:45,823
你還得明白光反射不同表面的物理知識
you also understand the physics of the way that light reacts of different surfaces

676
00:35:40,482 --> 00:35:43,482
{\a6}獨立日，1996

677
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:50,783
你得明白動畫繪製，人怎麼動，其他的東西怎麼做
you got to understand animation, you got understand the way people move creatures move

678
00:35:51,491 --> 00:35:54,800
你得同時成為藝術家和技師
you have to be an artist and a technician at the same time

679
00:35:54,834 --> 00:35:57,481
這是個奇妙的組合
that's an interesting combination

680
00:35:57,783 --> 00:36:00,783
{\a6}鄧尼斯 莫倫，工業光魔視覺特效總監
（星際大戰 / E.T. / 侏羅紀公園）

681
00:35:57,718 --> 00:36:01,386
最初的視覺特效師和頭一百年特效師幹的沒什麼兩樣
originally visual FX was done was the first hundred years of the FX was done

682
00:36:01,632 --> 00:36:09,480
用模型和膠卷攝影，能做的實際很有限
they were done with models and with film cameras and they are very limit what you can do

683
00:36:09,620 --> 00:36:16,168
<i>我們花費了很多時間、經歷和人們的努力來做《星際大戰》
but a lot of time and energy and people worked a lot to being able to make star wars film</i>

684
00:36:21,741 --> 00:36:24,620
22年前我入行的時候
when I first doing this about 22 years ago

685
00:36:24,841 --> 00:36:28,603
我學習的環境是真實的，有個舞臺
the environment I learned it was a physical one, it was a stage

686
00:36:24,877 --> 00:36:27,877
{\a6}亞當 瓦爾德斯，MPC視覺特效總監
（魔戒/ 納尼亞傳奇 /  星艦戰將）

687
00:36:28,672 --> 00:36:31,690
微縮模型、燈光和其他的一些東西都在那
miniatures, camera lights and everything in it

688
00:36:32,898 --> 00:36:35,777
做真實模型有個好處
the great thing about making real stuff is

689
00:36:35,778 --> 00:36:39,817
你要用上全部感情和身體感知
you got to use all of your senses and your physical perceptions and

690
00:36:39,818 --> 00:36:42,842
接著3個人和其他挑剔的模型師站過去
stand there are 3 different people and critical modelers

691
00:36:42,843 --> 00:36:46,604
討論著某件東西在真實光源中是有多酷，那感覺真滿足
talks about how cool something looks like in real lighting is pretty satisfying

692
00:36:48,270 --> 00:36:52,217
拍出來的東西送去用光學印片機
and all those photography was on the optical printer in the end

693
00:36:53,453 --> 00:36:57,725
就是一部大機器，把多層膠卷壓在一起
that's a large device that actually compress layers of film together

694
00:36:57,906 --> 00:37:01,157
然後用這些組合膠卷曝光
and creates new exposures of the film so you can combine it the layers

695
00:37:01,158 --> 00:37:03,850
這樣組合出來的圖像就是電影的最終效果
with images into the final one that you've seen in the movie

696
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:13,105
視覺特效部，就是實打實的把膠卷一張又一張再一張的疊起來
the visual FX department was literately sandwiching one piece of film next to another piece of film
next to another piece of film

697
00:37:08,111 --> 00:37:11,111
{\a6}喬納森 福克納，FrameStone視覺特效總監
（阿凡達 / 福爾摩斯 / V怪客）

698
00:37:13,318 --> 00:37:17,173
而這個過程可能引入巨大的人為破壞
and that really introduces huge mantle depredation

699
00:37:18,849 --> 00:37:23,400
<i>1978年，我們剛剛完成了《星際大戰》
in 1978, we had just finished star wars</i>

700
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,320
那時候我們沒找到更好的數位方法，所以製作還是比較艱苦的
we don't find digital sharps in there which were very very cruel

701
00:37:28,605 --> 00:37:31,070
比如那個場景的數學圖像和其他的一些東西
the diagram with that part kind of thing

702
00:37:31,071 --> 00:37:34,090
不過我知道有些人正在用數位技術做電影
but I knew a lot of guys, they were working with the digital film

703
00:37:34,395 --> 00:37:36,067
所以我成立了一個電腦部門
so I start a computer division

704
00:37:36,627 --> 00:37:40,832
我們在那給工業光魔創立了皮克斯
we developed the pixar computer for ILM

705
00:37:41,186 --> 00:37:44,777
我現在就在我們工業光魔3個電腦室之一
I'm right now with one of our three computer rooms we have here in ILM

706
00:37:44,778 --> 00:37:46,449
我們在這有
and what we have here are

707
00:37:46,450 --> 00:37:50,905
時時刻刻都在運作的千千萬萬的電腦程式
thousand and millions of cycles of computer power going by every single second

708
00:37:50,906 --> 00:37:54,202
我有點強迫他們盡可能取工業光魔的資源
so I kind push the staff use as much as they could in ILM

709
00:37:54,437 --> 00:37:57,502
在視覺組能夠提供的情況下
with this graphics crew that we have

710
00:37:56,502 --> 00:37:59,502
{\a6}星際迷航2， 1982

711
00:38:00,335 --> 00:38:01,729
令人興奮的是
the exciting about it was

712
00:38:01,730 --> 00:38:03,540
（數位製作）沒那麼多規矩
they didn't feel like with a lot of rules

713
00:38:04,000 --> 00:38:06,322
一點也不像“狂野西部”
they really don't seems like kind of wild west

714
00:38:06,323 --> 00:38:15,551
掃描膠卷到電腦上並在那做修改成為可能
it starts to become possible to scanning film and bringing the film into the computer and make
changes to that

715
00:38:17,441 --> 00:38:21,109
數位化膠卷的好處太多了
massive advantage to digitizing your film

716
00:38:21,271 --> 00:38:24,847
可以不必造成任何破壞
with that you couldn't get any depredation

717
00:38:25,342 --> 00:38:28,315
一旦數位化，就是一堆0和1
once it's digital there is 1s and 0s

718
00:38:28,316 --> 00:38:31,658
這些0和1在整個過程中都不會改變
they just stay 1s and 0s all the way down the pipe

719
00:38:32,209 --> 00:38:34,995
數位技術對特效來說變得非常重要
(?)digital became important for a FX point of view

720
00:38:35,081 --> 00:38:39,679
特效舞台中的第一條通道
the first path through the system was in the FX arena

721
00:38:39,912 --> 00:38:46,042
利用數位技術來讓幻想成真
it was using digital technology to realize visions

722
00:38:46,043 --> 00:38:48,503
要是能把膠卷轉換成數位
if you can take piece of film you can turn it into numbers

723
00:38:48,688 --> 00:38:51,614
你能夠控制這些數位再變回影片
you can manipulate those numbers through back to the film

724
00:38:51,681 --> 00:38:54,679
不過卻沒有任何限制
but there's no limit to what you could do

725
00:38:55,140 --> 00:38:58,112
整個世界的大門由此打開
the entire world is wide open

726
00:38:58,262 --> 00:39:02,302
我們所製作的第一個完全數位化的畫面
the first real image that we did that was completely digital

727
00:39:02,344 --> 00:39:04,666
<i>是在《少年福爾摩斯》中
was in young Sherlock Holmes</i>

728
00:39:04,666 --> 00:39:07,666
{\a6}少年福爾摩斯，1985

729
00:39:06,000 --> 00:39:08,729
我們有個彩色玻璃做的角色
we have a character made of stained glass

730
00:39:08,730 --> 00:39:11,145
那個玻璃看起來像真的
the glass actually looks real

731
00:39:11,340 --> 00:39:13,159
不像畫出來的
not like a graphic in that sort

732
00:39:13,610 --> 00:39:18,070
花了6個月和7場拍攝，很複雜
and it took 6 months and 7 shots which was pretty complicated

733
00:39:18,071 --> 00:39:20,488
不過最後效果出來的時候很不錯
but it's amazing we got it done at that time

734
00:39:20,496 --> 00:39:23,496
{\a6}詹姆斯 科麥隆，導演/製片
（阿凡達 / 鐵達尼號 / 魔鬼終結者）

735
00:39:20,496 --> 00:39:23,190
喬治總是在數位技術上更進一步
George was always progressive about digital

736
00:39:23,409 --> 00:39:29,539
而且技術平臺的交互性讓人覺得很舒服，很早以前就是如此
(?)and something about the fetch communer you just got comfortable with it really early on

737
00:39:28,189 --> 00:39:31,189
{\a6}無底洞，1989

738
00:39:32,174 --> 00:39:35,174
{\a6}魔鬼終結者2，1991

{\a6}侏羅紀公園，1993

740
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:41,110
{\a6}我不笨，我有話要說，1995

741
00:39:38,110 --> 00:39:40,432
<i>我現在要當一隻羊
I was just trying to be a sheep now</i>

742
00:39:40,443 --> 00:39:42,519
<i>哼，狼已經來了
huh, that wolf's in the world already</i>

743
00:39:42,519 --> 00:39:45,519
{\a6}第五元素，1997

{\a6} 星艦戰將，1997

745
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:52,136
那時我們還是用膠卷攝影機
now we are still shooting on film

746
00:39:52,227 --> 00:39:54,315
還不能直接使用數位拍攝
we ain't able to shoot on digital cameras yet

747
00:39:52,720 --> 00:39:55,720
{\a6}鐵達尼號，1997

748
00:39:54,484 --> 00:39:57,270
不過所有的後期製作已經提前數位化了
but all of the post processes is start in front of line

749
00:40:00,796 --> 00:40:03,066
你怎麼進到電腦裡的
how did you going into the computer?

750
00:40:04,558 --> 00:40:08,227
我拿出手來讓他們照張相
I would have my hand and then they would take a picture of it

751
00:40:08,462 --> 00:40:11,809
{\a6}駭客任務，1999

752
00:40:09,809 --> 00:40:10,809
然後會有台電腦
and then there was a computer

753
00:40:09,810 --> 00:40:13,425
把所有都處理成銀一樣，那就是我的手
it would do the animation of all look silver and silver hand

754
00:40:13,840 --> 00:40:16,212
然後他們就把這個放到大螢幕上給你看
and they will show you on the movie screen

755
00:40:18,505 --> 00:40:21,756
我們在《駭客任務三部曲》的經驗是

（駭客任務三部曲 / 駭速快手 / 雲圖）

757
00:40:24,390 --> 00:40:25,390
當你意識到這點其實很有趣
what was really interesting with that you realize

758
00:40:24,391 --> 00:40:28,438
你其實是在碰運氣
you are really creating these images in toss

759
00:40:29,433 --> 00:40:33,626
你拍不到這些而只能在電腦上做
you couldn't shoot the image you made the image in the computer

760
00:40:36,215 --> 00:40:38,723
90年代中後期
middle to late 90s

761
00:40:39,137 --> 00:40:44,976
(?)您是如何開始進行視覺特效的？
I guess its standard death… visual FX… where do you get in

762
00:40:45,193 --> 00:40:47,283
我們在工業光魔有個做特效的項目
we have program in ILM doing our FX

763
00:40:47,284 --> 00:40:50,719
我們要把膠卷轉換為數位才能完成
we have convert from film to digital in order to do it

764
00:40:50,831 --> 00:40:54,453
這得花一大筆錢，現在我們已經不用再進行這樣的轉換了
it's a huge amount of money just now we don't have to convert any more

765
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:57,271
膠卷很難處理
film is cumbersome

766
00:40:57,272 --> 00:41:01,798
我想省錢省時間，我要解決這個問題
so I just want to take my money and my time, I'm gonna fix it

767
00:41:02,645 --> 00:41:05,849
我們去索尼公司和他們說
when we went to SONY, and we said:

768
00:41:05,850 --> 00:41:10,307
我們幫你造個數位攝影機吧
we would like to help you work with you to build a digital camera

769
00:41:11,136 --> 00:41:16,059
<i>他（盧卡斯）決定星戰（前傳）第二部要用數位技術拍
he was on the determine that star wars episode 2 can kind be shot digitally</i>

770
00:41:16,553 --> 00:41:20,965
這就意味所有的工作都要為
that means get all that work out, get pipeline figured out for doing

771
00:41:20,096 --> 00:41:23,925
數位拍攝電影準備好
our production at digital cameras

772
00:41:24,151 --> 00:41:27,216
早期數位攝影的問題之一是
one of the problems with early digital capture

773
00:41:27,433 --> 00:41:28,919
圖像的解析度
was resolution

774
00:41:29,105 --> 00:41:32,078
解析度是由很多因素決定的
resolution is depended on many factors

775
00:41:32,100 --> 00:41:34,121
不過最基本的因素是
but in the most basic terms

776
00:41:34,122 --> 00:41:37,418
攝影機所能記錄的圖元數
it is the number of pixels that the camera can record

777
00:41:37,419 --> 00:41:40,870
圖元數越多，解析度越高
the more pixels you had, the higher the resolution

778
00:41:40,871 --> 00:41:43,749
圖像所具有的細節也更多
and more detail a image would have

779
00:41:44,184 --> 00:41:47,481
一部標準SD攝影機
a typical standard definition of resolution of SD camera

780
00:41:47,482 --> 00:41:52,822
通常具有720 × 480的解析度
usually have a resolution of about 720 × 480 pixels

781
00:41:54,390 --> 00:41:57,455
轉折發生在2000年
really, the turn-in point was in the year 2000

782
00:41:57,456 --> 00:42:02,398
我們推出了F900，第一部高解析度攝影機
we came out with F900 camera which was the first high definition camera

783
00:42:02,399 --> 00:42:05,479
在那之前，所有的數位拍攝看起來都像錄影
before that, whatever you look was really look like video

784
00:42:05,500 --> 00:42:14,396
高解析度攝影機可以達到1920解析度，也就是2K以下
high definition cameras record resolution about 1920 pixels across, just under 2K

785
00:42:15,422 --> 00:42:18,422
{\a6}克隆人進攻，2002

786
00:42:20,313 --> 00:42:22,310
2002年
in 2002

787
00:42:22,311 --> 00:42:24,400
<i>我們完成了《克隆人的進攻》
we did the attack of the clones</i>

788
00:42:25,120 --> 00:42:29,160
這是第一部高解析度攝影的電影
it was the first major feature that was shot high definition

789
00:42:31,596 --> 00:42:34,475
<i>喬治在《星際大戰》中
what George did in star wars movie</i>

790
00:42:34,476 --> 00:42:37,866
實驗性的使用了高解析度攝影機
was take experimental HD camera

791
00:42:37,867 --> 00:42:41,395
其畫面品質已達到膠卷水準
and ply it to feature film parallel

792
00:42:41,396 --> 00:42:44,396
{\a6}盧卡斯影業，舊金山，加利福尼亞

793
00:42:42,472 --> 00:42:44,515
這在當時是不可想像的
that was unthinkable at that time

794
00:42:45,775 --> 00:42:48,979
不僅僅是對電影協會
it meant that it was around the entire film community

795
00:42:48,980 --> 00:42:51,952
更是對膠卷電影本身
but more deeply mean it was around film itself

796
00:42:52,424 --> 00:42:56,975
那時的好萊塢人們經歷了嚴重兩極分化的時期
it became a really really polarizing time for a lot people in Hollywood

797
00:42:56,975 --> 00:43:00,179
有好多大會都說我是個騙子
we got a lot bit big meetings saying I was doubling carneys

798
00:43:00,613 --> 00:43:03,539
說我會摧毀電影工業和好多人的工作
I was going to destroy our industry, I was going to destroy our jobs

799
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:08,853
<i>在影院裡他們說：“他嘴上說《克隆人的進攻》是數位拍的，其實不是，
in theater that he said he shot the attack of the clones digitally, but he didn't</i>

800
00:43:08,854 --> 00:43:11,420
“我們聽說他其實還是用膠卷拍的，
we have the words that he actually used film cameras

801
00:43:11,421 --> 00:43:14,531
“他沒用數位拍攝，他欺騙了所有人。”
he's not shooting digital, he's lying to everybody

802
00:43:15,227 --> 00:43:19,128
在1920解析度下，我覺得畫質真的令人震驚
with 1900, I thought the images out there is truly appalling

803
00:43:20,000 --> 00:43:23,390
就是影院品質
I think that was a cinematic camera at all

804
00:43:23,803 --> 00:43:29,608
早些年，我不覺得數位攝影（和膠卷）一樣
in early years, I didn't feel digital capture or digital production was the same

805
00:43:29,609 --> 00:43:32,116
他們總說：看，能看出差別嗎？
they would always say: see, if you can tell the difference?

806
00:43:32,475 --> 00:43:34,240
然後我說能
and I could tell the difference

807
00:43:34,847 --> 00:43:39,584
我們的F900並非為拍攝電影而設計
our first F900 wasn't designed like a film camera

808
00:43:40,162 --> 00:43:42,902
<i>不過喬治盧卡斯用它拍了《星戰前傳》後
of course George Lucas had it shoot star wars</i>

809
00:43:42,903 --> 00:43:45,920
就再也不打算用膠卷拍電影了
like he wouldn't shoot another film on film again

810
00:43:46,218 --> 00:43:49,515
這在好萊塢也獲得了很多支持
and that created quite enough pro in Hollywood

811
00:43:49,752 --> 00:43:52,399
數位技術和數位攝影機
digital technology and digital cameras

812
00:43:52,400 --> 00:43:57,368
看起來像是一種對
looked like a threat to people's existence in

813
00:43:57,369 --> 00:43:59,133
人們思考和工作方式的威脅
way of thinking and way of working

814
00:43:59,492 --> 00:44:00,793
電影製作是藝術
film making is an art

815
00:44:00,794 --> 00:44:04,368
對於傳統的電影製作者來說
to the traditional film maker it looks like

816
00:44:04,576 --> 00:44:06,341
我們像是在糟蹋藝術
we were messing around with art

817
00:44:06,418 --> 00:44:09,437
他們說你為什麼不思進取
and they said why you went backwards, you know what

818
00:44:09,658 --> 00:44:14,766
不過也有很多人說這是有必要的，是前進的必要環節
but it's a lot said about the necessity, a link back be able to spring forward

819
00:44:14,767 --> 00:44:17,767
{\a6}天行者牧場，加利福尼亞

10年前喬治盧卡斯把大家聚在一起
George Lucas putting up together everybody 10 years ago

821
00:44:19,059 --> 00:44:21,937
在舊金山的天行者牧場開了個會
what a conference he gave the ranch up in San Francisco

822
00:44:22,656 --> 00:44:29,251
澄清了一個事實
and went object of our roles about the idea that

823
00:44:29,443 --> 00:44:32,555
數位技術是不是會把電影攝製終結
digital will put an end to the old cinematography

824
00:44:32,560 --> 00:44:35,016
他說這就是另一個工具而已
he point out that it's just another tool

825
00:44:36,259 --> 00:44:37,280
而且這一點不錯
and that's true

826
00:44:37,281 --> 00:44:39,509
當人們看到了喬治盧卡斯的測試
when people saw George Lucas's test

827
00:44:39,510 --> 00:44:42,435
他們說，這可行不通
they said: that's not gonna work

828
00:44:42,500 --> 00:44:46,640
不過也有人想，我大概會在10年內接受它
it was the same sort of close mind that we're gonna work 10 years to adopt that

829
00:44:46,641 --> 00:44:49,741
我得等等，有人上我就上，我上了大家就都上了
I was gonna wait a little, if someone followed I will be one, I will one and that will be entire

830
00:44:49,742 --> 00:44:51,646
我知道是時候了，總是這樣的
I know the time is it, it always does

{\a6}《墨西哥往事》片場，2003，設備：SONY F900

832
00:44:51,647 --> 00:44:55,454
我知道這是某件大事的開端
I can tell this is gonna be the beginning of something big

833
00:44:55,460 --> 00:44:57,265
而我想成為這件事的一部分
and I want to be there for that

834
00:44:57,266 --> 00:44:58,672
但是畫面很爛啊
but the image sucked

835
00:44:58,673 --> 00:45:02,341
畫面沒那麼差，就是不如膠卷拍的好
the image wasn't bad, but the image wasn't as good as film

836
00:45:02,701 --> 00:45:06,138
不過卻可以讓我做一些從沒法完成的事
but it allowed me to do something you cannot ever done

837

00:45:08,507 --> 00:45:12,362
<i>我想到了《萬惡城市》那本書，我知道該怎麼做了
I picked it in my sin city book, and I know how to do it now</i>

839
00:45:12,363 --> 00:45:14,034
我應該用數位拍攝
I got shoot this digital

840
00:45:14,350 --> 00:45:16,115
可以就像漫畫書裡表現的那樣
I can make it looks just like the book

841
00:45:16,116 --> 00:45:17,648
<i>夜晚如地獄般炎熱
the night is hot as hell</i>

842
00:45:18,493 --> 00:45:20,351
<i>樓上有一位女神
upstairs there is a goddess</i>

843
00:45:21,003 --> 00:45:22,814
<i>她說她要我
she's telling me she wants me</i>

844
00:45:22,815 --> 00:45:25,400
<i>如果不是數位攝影，《萬惡城市》不會存在
sin city will not exist if I didn't choose digital film</i>

845
00:45:25,401 --> 00:45:27,133
我甚至根本想不到去拍
I wouldn't even thought to do it

846
00:45:28,194 --> 00:45:31,491
他們想要一些事情推動藝術形式的發展
they wish to do thing that push the art form

847
00:45:31,492 --> 00:45:34,417
技術推動藝術，而藝術也推動技術發展
technology push the art and art push technology

848
00:45:35,723 --> 00:45:37,952
<i>《萬惡城市》的出現石破天驚
sin city came out hit people like break eggs</i>

849
00:45:37,953 --> 00:45:40,042
他們不知道他們看的是什麼
they have no idea what they are looking at

850
00:45:40,043 --> 00:45:43,711
他們想要在表面下的有些東西消失
something hiding from it under rock and hopes it goes away

851
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:47,890
你完成了一些人認為不可能的事情
you end it up doing something that people didn't realize was possible

852
00:45:49,235 --> 00:45:54,018
效果如此驚人，你知道一切皆有可能
it's so amazed that which it had that knowing anything is possible

853
00:45:54,019 --> 00:45:57,919
這個系統有著你從沒感受過的顏色廣度
the system got better for color and you didn't working of that color space

854
00:46:03,543 --> 00:46:07,583
電影經過了拍攝、剪輯和視覺特效合成後
after the movie is shot, edited and VFX being added

855
00:46:07,584 --> 00:46:12,367
色彩配光師會在實驗室裡繼續調整電影的畫面
the colorist or color timers in the lab make adjustment to the look of the movie

856
00:46:13,394 --> 00:46:15,623
在傳統化學攝影法中
in the traditional photo chemical method

857
00:46:15,624 --> 00:46:18,456
底片要經過顯影和印片
the negative is developed in print is made

858
00:46:19,312 --> 00:46:23,770
在黑白電影時代的配光
timing goes back to the days when there's only black and white

859
00:46:19,312 --> 00:46:22,312
{\a6}唐 希亞那，特藝彩色配光師

860
00:46:23,771 --> 00:46:28,693
<i>這些畫面展示了舊時實驗室的暗房操作
these scenes showed the dark room operations of the laboratory in the old days</i>

861
00:46:28,694 --> 00:46:34,126
主要就是自己看底片
I had my job it's looked at the negative and the side how long

862
00:46:34,127 --> 00:46:36,913
以及要在顯影床裡泡多長時間
it would have to stay in the beds

863
00:46:36,914 --> 00:46:38,826
<i>第一次如果不行…
if the first wasn't right…</i>

864
00:46:38,860 --> 00:46:41,065
那就繼續泡
dunk, dunk again

865
00:46:41,066 --> 00:46:44,863
所以這就是配光跟時間的關係
so, it was time related

866
00:46:45,687 --> 00:46:47,637
隨著彩色膠卷的發明
with the advent of color film

867
00:46:47,637 --> 00:46:50,637
{\a6}綠野仙蹤，1939

868
00:46:47,638 --> 00:46:50,981
配光師的工作也變成更具創造性的過程
the timers became more involved into creative process

869
00:46:53,740 --> 00:46:58,012
實驗室裡，色彩配光師、攝影指導和導演決定
at the lab, the color timer, DP, and director determine the look

870
00:46:58,013 --> 00:47:02,053
最後的印片樣式，以在影院上映
for the final prints there will be seen by the public in the theaters

871
00:47:03,666 --> 00:47:06,452
化學攝影中唯一能做的調整是
the only adjustment that can make photo chemically

872
00:47:06,453 --> 00:47:11,375
紅綠藍三原色及亮度的整合
are color bands between red, green, blue and brightness

873
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:18,780
我們的工作就是達成導演和攝影想要的結果
our job basically is to achieve the vision of the director and the DP

874
00:47:15,363 --> 00:47:18,363
{\a6}泰瑞 海格，特藝彩色配光師

875
00:47:19,109 --> 00:47:21,570
並在膠卷上實現
and make it happen on a piece of film

876
00:47:22,555 --> 00:47:25,248
我會和導演和攝影坐在一起
like I was sitting with the director and the DP

877
00:47:25,249 --> 00:47:28,499
他們會說這有點太紅或太模糊或太藍了
and they'll say that is a little bit too red, too smear, too blue

878
00:47:28,922 --> 00:47:34,309
然後我們就在頭腦中調整
and we will manipulated in our minds as how much to

879
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:39,743
怎麼改變或做不同的對比度平衡
change it or to make different cuts balance with each othe

880
00:47:40,813 --> 00:47:42,345
膠卷時代的配光
when the time was on the film

881
00:47:42,054 --> 00:47:46,664
基本上靠腦袋想然後用嘴說
they got to do it pretty much from the head by the tuition

882
00:47:46,664 --> 00:47:47,407
是嗎
yeah

883
00:47:47,408 --> 00:47:49,497
這很難的，非常難
it was hard, very hard

884
00:47:47,408 --> 00:47:50,408
{\a6}安德列 巴克維亞，攝影師
（非法入侵 / 捍衛戰警 / 魔鬼代言人）

885
00:47:50,665 --> 00:47:54,500
所以為了做到要付出很多勞動和藝術心血
so in order to do this there were a lot of art and labor involved in it

886
00:47:54,666 --> 00:47:58,312
為了達到最後的效果，這些人很努力
these people really work hard to that, achieve that

887
00:47:59,578 --> 00:48:05,569
配光是個很令人沮喪的過程
I still found it very very frustrating that timing process

888
00:48:05,570 --> 00:48:09,470
在片子播放的時候在不停的說，還要跟上剪輯的速度
you kind of talking over the thing while it's running and trying to keep up with the cuts

889
00:48:09,470 --> 00:48:12,470
{\a6}史蒂文 索德伯格，導演/攝影師
（瞞天過海 / 切 格瓦拉 / 全境擴散）

890
00:48:09,471 --> 00:48:12,311
然後還有些專業辭彙
and saying that I don't know it's a little science to me

891
00:48:12,312 --> 00:48:15,609
他們就不停地把註腳寫下來
something in the guys they are trying to write it down, write the footage down

892
00:48:15,610 --> 00:48:20,576
這個過程一直就是這樣，感覺很瘋狂
as it goes on you can't stop and that seems crazy

893
00:48:23,364 --> 00:48:27,776
數位色彩校正工具首先被使用到短片中
digital color correction tools were first to use for shorter pieces

894
00:48:27,777 --> 00:48:30,098
例如廣告和音樂錄影
such as commercials and music videos

895
00:48:30,100 --> 00:48:32,420
在音樂錄影中配光
basting time in music videos

896
00:48:32,421 --> 00:48:35,421
{\a6}史蒂芬 索納菲德，DI配光師
（落日殺神 / 300壯士 / 愛麗絲漫遊仙境）

897
00:48:32,421 --> 00:48:41,012
我們完成了最瘋狂的和最具突破性的視覺體驗
and we came up some of the craziest and ground breaking visual images

898
00:48:41,498 --> 00:48:46,095
而來到這樣的一個房間
and it was just amazing ability to come to a room like this

899
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:52,365
搞一些從來沒人見過的畫面影像
and manipulate something to create images that people never seen before

900
00:48:56,000 --> 00:49:01,340
數位色彩校正開始取代傳統的化學攝影色彩配光
digital color correction began replacing traditional photo chemical methods of color timing

901
00:49:03,151 --> 00:49:06,151
{\a6}吉爾 柏格丹諾維茲，DI配光師
（胡佛傳 / 經典老爺車 / 心靈傳奇—雷查爾斯的一生）

902
00:49:03,151 --> 00:49:07,860
我的工作就是保證製作人能夠達到他們想要的效果
my job is to be able to make sure the creatives get everything what they want

903
00:49:07,861 --> 00:49:11,041
保證攝影得到他要的對比度
make sure the photographer gets the pilot of contrast that he wants

904
00:49:11,042 --> 00:49:14,000
保證導演想要的電影色調
and the director gets the feelings he wants around movie

905
00:49:14,001 --> 00:49:16,322
保證我們能看到演員的眼睛
make sure that we can see all actors eyes

906
00:49:16,323 --> 00:49:18,736
飽含他想要的感情
and see all the emotion that he wants to see

907
00:49:19,641 --> 00:49:23,217
現在我來建立一個我們說的編輯區
I can now start building what we call power window

908
00:49:23,218 --> 00:49:28,418
在這我可以做任何我想要的改動
in a power window I can change any kind of view I want

909
00:49:28,518 --> 00:49:32,180
比如左邊的這些樹
I just want these trees over on the left

910
00:49:32,181 --> 00:49:37,427
我可以改變它們的顏色
I can take the color that I want on those trees

911
00:49:37,428 --> 00:49:40,260
我能把它隔離出來
and I can isolate it

912
00:49:40,261 --> 00:49:44,765
接著就可以變成任何顏色了
now I can change those trees in any color I want

913
00:49:45,127 --> 00:49:48,982
導演和攝影師會來和我們一起幾周
the cinematographer and the director coming and we spend a couple of weeks

914
00:49:48,983 --> 00:49:51,983
{\a6}提姆 斯蒂潘，DI配光師
（黑天鵝 / 力挽狂瀾 / 切 格瓦拉）

915
00:49:48,983 --> 00:49:52,418
把電影調整到更好看
grading the film and give it that look make it look beautiful

916
00:49:52,419 --> 00:49:55,127
到他們想要的程度
however they want to look

917
00:49:55,128 --> 00:49:59,802
只要合理我都能做到，這種感覺很棒
I had a great feeling that I can do just about anything you asked me to do it in reason

918
00:49:59,803 --> 00:50:01,938
是誰發明了這個系統呢
who invented this process

919
00:50:01,939 --> 00:50:04,910
你知道曾經用在音樂錄影上的技術吧
the same technology people used for music videos

920
00:50:04,911 --> 00:50:06,397
把畫面變得很酷
create how cool it looks

921
00:50:06,398 --> 00:50:10,158
而現在的技術是過去的10年間發展起來的
and basically what happened was over last 10 years

922
00:50:10,159 --> 00:50:13,223
只是更加進化並自由了
it just evolved and it becomes a lot more free mind

923
00:50:13,223 --> 00:50:16,223
{\a6}霹靂高手，2000

924
00:50:15,586 --> 00:50:18,099
這是第一部從頭到尾
Over there were art that it was really the first movie

925
00:50:18,261 --> 00:50:20,724
使用特效配光的電影
where at basically that every single frame was the visual fact

926
00:50:20,885 --> 00:50:25,009
為了達到效果用數位技術配光
So its all color times digitally for the look

927
00:50:25,107 --> 00:50:27,698
所以這是第一部DI
So it's a first DI. It's just kind of…

928
00:50:27,813 --> 00:50:30,771
羅傑迪金斯（《霹靂高手》攝影師）在這說：
Roger Deakins sit in the room and saying

929
00:50:30,916 --> 00:50:33,331
我不能用化學攝影法
I can't get what I want in photo chemical

930
00:50:33,458 --> 00:50:37,187
因為每次我想要給配光成美麗的金色藍天就全沒了
Because every time I color time this nice golden color I lose my blue sky

931
00:50:37,316 --> 00:50:38,851
我該怎麼辦啊
what am I gonna do

932
00:50:38,964 --> 00:50:40,578
<i>有點太黃了是不是
it's a little bit yellow isn't it</i>

933
00:50:40,723 --> 00:50:42,611
<i>應該更棕一點
should be sort of more brown</i>

934
00:50:42,756 --> 00:50:45,347
所以我跟他說
So he came in to testing actually I sat with him and showed him

935
00:50:45,479 --> 00:50:51,378
我們能做，我們能做到畫面中的每個細節
Ok we can key it, what we do is we can basically affect everything in the image

936
00:50:51,474 --> 00:50:54,418
不過藍天是不行了，因為這會毀掉其他的東西
except for the blue in the sky also they will ruin overalls

937
00:50:54,564 --> 00:50:56,850
所以藍色就不能用了
so the blue's in wardrobe

938
00:50:56,996 --> 00:51:00,435
不過其他的，像這些綠樹如果不是你要的顏色
but everything else like the green trees that are not in pilot that you want

939
00:51:00,529 --> 00:51:02,897
我們可以把它調成棕黃色
we can exaggerate them in brown gold

940
00:51:06,279 --> 00:51:10,161
所以這部電影的畫面很成功
so out of the successive look for the movie

941
00:51:10,162 --> 00:51:12,400
接著其他的人也跟進
and other people catching on and say

942
00:51:12,401 --> 00:51:15,003
“哇，我也可以試試那個”
woo, I can use that in

943
00:51:15,004 --> 00:51:18,572
接著就變得流行起來
it just became more and more popular

944
00:51:18,573 --> 00:51:21,350
化學攝影配光法真的很令人沮喪
timing is a very frustrating process on photo chemical

945
00:51:21,351 --> 00:51:24,284
很殘酷而且也基本上幹不了什麼
it's very cruelled, hardly to do anything

946
00:51:24,300 --> 00:51:26,049
不過DI就不一樣了
that's a whole thing about DI

947
00:51:26,080 --> 00:51:30,580
我可以圈出一個小東西，可以讓一張臉更紅
while I can go in to circle a little thing and make a face a little bit redder

948
00:51:30,597 --> 00:51:34,080
還可以隔離背景，簡直是天堂啊
and bring out the background I was just in heaven

949
00:51:34,081 --> 00:51:36,960
太不可思議了，我可以做任何事來完成一部電影
it's amazing I can do anything to success movie

950
00:51:36,961 --> 00:51:39,647
現在回想比較有趣的是
what I find interesting now looking back

951
00:51:39,648 --> 00:51:45,382
從我最初成為攝影師的時候開始
to the beginning of experimentation of as a cinematographer like myself

952
00:51:45,383 --> 00:51:48,383
{\a6}王牌冤家，2004

953
00:51:45,383 --> 00:51:49,540
從電影誕生到數位世界
Going from a film original and the digital world

954
00:51:49,541 --> 00:51:54,693
我們一直在尋找能夠控制畫面並更具操控力的方法
Seeking more control of the image and being able to manipulate the image more

955
00:51:54,694 --> 00:51:57,294
不過現在卻是我們失去了更多控制
And now we actually have lost control

956
00:51:57,300 --> 00:52:02,635
我們放棄了底片，也放棄了成品
Because we then give away our negative, give away our product

957
00:52:02,636 --> 00:52:06,257
能拿到的人都可以對其進行操作
Anybody can take it after that and can manipulate it

958
00:52:06,660 --> 00:52:10,979
這是最後成品很重要的一個方面
(?)this cording is really an important aspect of the final product

959
00:52:11,230 --> 00:52:15,502
我是把電影做成更好的樣子
I'm the one that pushing these buttons to make your film look a certain way

960
00:52:15,503 --> 00:52:17,313
雖然我要接受指示
Yes I'm getting the direction but

961
00:52:17,314 --> 00:52:21,490
不過這需要很多自己的東西來承擔這個責任
it's a lot of my own confidence to crane that certain amount

962
00:52:21,491 --> 00:52:23,583
把它帶領到一個正確的方向
And push that into a certain direction

963
00:52:23,590 --> 00:52:27,577
所以我基本上是真正接觸它的人
So I'm kind of like the last person who really gets the touch of it

964
00:52:27,711 --> 00:52:31,705
攝影師和配光師之間開始變得對抗
It started to become very adversarial between cinematographer and colorist

965
00:52:31,706 --> 00:52:35,838
因為他們都想“他不是決定電影畫面的人，我才是”
because they were like “he shouldn't be determining how the film looks like, I do that”

966
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,157
不過過程之美就在於這是個團隊啊
the beauty of this process is it's a team

967
00:52:39,158 --> 00:52:42,548
這有可能把DP的權利削弱
it could take the power away from the DP but I think it's

968
00:52:42,549 --> 00:52:47,795
不過我認為作為攝影師的工作就是儘量讓拍出來的東西好看
your job as a cinematographer to try your best to see it through the eye

969
00:52:48,445 --> 00:52:52,114
他們會儘量控制DI
They will do everything to make sure they president the DI

970
00:52:52,115 --> 00:52:56,572
來實現他們所想的畫面
And that will supervise that the dare vision they intend was executed

971
00:52:56,573 --> 00:52:59,573
{\a6}邁克爾 包豪斯，攝影師
（紐約黑幫 / 四海好傢伙 / 神鬼無間）

972
00:52:56,573 --> 00:52:59,452
<i>在《紐約黑幫》裡，他們要我做DI
In gangs of New York  they offer me to do a DI</i>

973
00:52:59,453 --> 00:53:02,453
{\a6}紐約黑幫，2002

974
00:53:02,729 --> 00:53:06,676
因為每件事都已經準備好了
But because everything was built for us

975
00:53:06,677 --> 00:53:10,020
我們從大螢幕上看見的就是我們想要的
what we had on screen was exactly what we wanted

976
00:53:10,100 --> 00:53:14,711
並不需要DI去改變什麼
It didn't have to have a DI to change everything

977
00:53:16,707 --> 00:53:19,261
我通常都是透過攝影機
but I'm trying always to do it in camera

978
00:53:19,281 --> 00:53:22,917
用光，濾鏡和鏡頭來調整圖像
and with lighting and with filters and lenses

979
00:53:22,918 --> 00:53:25,425
而不是拍完了用DI
But not later in the DI

980
00:53:25,426 --> 00:53:28,908
不過如果你有個特別的故事
OK, if you have a special story

981
00:53:28,950 --> 00:53:32,020
需要你改變現實
when you need to change the reality

982
00:53:32,021 --> 00:53:34,109
那DI就的確是個好東西
Then the DI is something wonderful

983
00:53:34,110 --> 00:53:37,174
因為你可以在畫面上實現你想做的一切
because you can do whatever you want in the image

984
00:53:37,175 --> 00:53:39,729
這很不錯
which can be great, which can be wonderful

985
00:53:41,406 --> 00:53:43,960
一旦電影數位化的拷貝完成了
Once we get done digitally clap cracking your movie

986
00:53:44,378 --> 00:53:47,629
我們會做一份全新的底片去印片
We make a brand new negative and then make a print of that negative

987
00:53:48,136 --> 00:53:52,176
然後我們會對比數位和印片
then we look at the print versus the data in the side by side fashion

988
00:53:57,647 --> 00:53:58,647
把印片和數位匹配
And we dealt in the print to match the data

989
00:53:58,826 --> 00:54:01,612
處理成需要的樣子
To make the print exact the way it should

990
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:10,345
你對製作母片的工作有什麼感覺
How do you feel about you do all these work to have a pristine

991
00:54:10,346 --> 00:54:14,943
有些印片很完美，有些就（不那麼好）
and you got to have some prints perfect, and some prints…

992
00:54:14,944 --> 00:54:17,961
完成之後你能放得下嗎
Will you let it go once you created it?

993
00:54:17,962 --> 00:54:21,119
說實話去電影院的時候
honestly the truth of the fact is that when you go to a theater

994
00:54:21,120 --> 00:54:24,323
你看到了幾周心血的最終版
You watch that prints used to spend weeks of labor on

995
00:54:24,324 --> 00:54:26,413
其實每家影院都不一樣
Every theater looks different

996
00:54:26,827 --> 00:54:30,125
放映機的光照強度不一樣
They have the lumination on their projector in different level

997
00:54:30,126 --> 00:54:32,075
還有其他的許多原因
or other so many variables

998
00:54:28,492 --> 00:54:36,982
我們真正擔心的改變畫面的東西實際上是放映機
The real alter alternatively from the picture we used to worry about is projections

999
00:54:36,983 --> 00:54:38,468
聲音可大可小
Sounds could be loud and low

1000
00:54:38,469 --> 00:54:40,743
演員的頭可能看見也可能看不見
You can see the head of the actor or not

1001
00:54:40,744 --> 00:54:43,065
因為放出框了，他們（放映員）挺忙的
Cause they can frame you out, cause they're busy

1002
00:54:43,066 --> 00:54:44,350
總有事情要做
They got things to do

1003
00:54:45,567 --> 00:54:48,492
可能一卷膠卷發藍，另一捲髮黃
film come up one reel be blue and another reel be brown

1004
00:54:48,430 --> 00:54:50,118
都是因為放映機
because use the projector like

1005
00:54:50,119 --> 00:54:53,090
我們曾經還挺享受這個，因為是電影的一部分嘛
we got to enjoy that because that's the part of film

1006
00:54:53,091 --> 00:54:57,409
我看到印片總是失望
it's always a huge disappointment for me to see a film print

1007
00:54:57,410 --> 00:54:58,616
因為真是太讓人鬱悶了
because it's depressing

1008
00:54:58,617 --> 00:55:02,006
一點也不清晰，沒個分明的中斷點
it's not sharp, it does not have any snap

1009
00:55:02,007 --> 00:55:05,304
搖搖晃晃，髒兮兮，相當可恨
it's shaking, it's dirty, I hate it

1010
00:55:06,712 --> 00:55:09,266
我把它放大巨大的顯示幕上
I put it in the tremendous monitor effort

1011
00:55:08,304 --> 00:55:11,304
{\a6}喬司 維克諾，攝影師
（從海底出擊 / 魔鬼總動員 /  星艦戰將）

1012
00:55:09,266 --> 00:55:14,189
就是為了我所想像的畫面成真
To make my images the way I have them in mind

1013
00:55:14,190 --> 00:55:19,158
我為此製作它們，在攝影機上完成它們
And I create them; I have them on the finish product in the camera

1014
00:55:19,159 --> 00:55:21,248
不過看看後來呢
But what happens afterwards

1015
00:55:21,583 --> 00:55:23,580
影院裡電影的品質真是慘不忍睹
The quality of film is terrible at theater

1016
00:55:24,181 --> 00:55:25,760
每個好萊塢人都會說：
And anybody in Hollywood they say:

1017
00:55:25,761 --> 00:55:27,664
“天啊，在攝影機上看著可不是這樣啊”
“Oh, it's not that of camera, no”

1018
00:55:27,665 --> 00:55:29,986
所以他們從來不去電影院，看看真正的影院放映是個什麼樣子
so they never go to a theater to see it in the real theater

1019
00:55:29,988 --> 00:55:35,234
<i>《鐵達尼號》播放的次數太多了，我們的印片事實上已經脫落了
Titanic plays so long in theaters we actually had our prints fell apart</i>

1020
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:38,600
早些時候從放映機裡掉出來摔碎了
They'd early just dropped out the projectors and in pieces

1021
00:55:39,523 --> 00:55:42,914
所以我們絞盡腦汁去獲得更好的放映品質
So we were struggling of trying to get qualities in the theaters

1022
00:55:43,594 --> 00:55:46,751
事實是，如果使用數位放映
And out of that came the fact that if it was digital

1023
00:55:47,578 --> 00:55:51,408
那效果就很棒了，沒有劃痕，也不會被撕裂
You have a brilliant thing, you wouldn't have to scratch it, you wouldn't have to tear it

1024
00:55:51,409 --> 00:55:53,637
<i>…這部電影已經席捲了…
…the movie has been overwhelming…</i>

1025
00:55:53,638 --> 00:55:57,585
<i>1999年，我們實現了數位放映《幽靈的威脅》
In 1999, we were able to project phantom menace digitally</i>

1026
00:55:57,586 --> 00:56:00,600
2家在紐約，2家在洛杉磯
We have 2 theaters in New York, 2 theaters in LA

1027
00:56:00,862 --> 00:56:05,749
那是主流好萊塢電影第一次用數位放映
And that was the first time that major Hollywood movie projected digitally

1028
00:56:06,071 --> 00:56:08,532
那時候全國也就40家（數位放映影院）
There were up to 40 there in this country

1029
00:56:09,495 --> 00:56:11,027
99年的時候
Just for in 99

1030
00:56:11,769 --> 00:56:16,878
2002年，有150家多點
By 2002, there were still over 150

1031
00:56:17,705 --> 00:56:20,166
不過已經落後了
The post flow was already there

1032
00:56:20,266 --> 00:56:21,195
全都數位化了
it is all digital

1033
00:56:21,428 --> 00:56:23,330
所以電影工業的其他也會跟進
And the rest of the industry was going there

1034
00:56:23,331 --> 00:56:27,883
聲音已經數位化了，剪輯方式也是
Sound was already got there, Editorial was got there

1035
00:56:27,884 --> 00:56:30,298
攝影機卻落後了
The camera is lagging behind

1036
00:56:30,462 --> 00:56:33,462
{\a6}落日殺神，2004

1037
00:56:33,718 --> 00:56:37,155
新的公司開始發展高解析度攝影機
New companies began to develop high definition cameras

1038
00:56:37,156 --> 00:56:40,313
其他的好萊塢電影也開始跟隨盧卡斯腳步
And the other Hollywood films followed Lucas's lead

1039
00:56:42,272 --> 00:56:45,615
<i>邁克爾曼的《落日殺神》使用了湯姆森響尾蛇
Michael Mann's  Collateral used the Thomson viper</i>

1040
00:56:45,616 --> 00:56:50,027
這是一架在黑暗環境中優於膠卷攝影機的高解析度攝影機
a HD camera that outperform film in shooting darker enviroments

1041
00:56:44,000 --> 00:56:47,000
{\a6}設備：湯姆森響尾蛇，2004

1042
00:56:51,747 --> 00:56:53,698
邁克爾想要在夜裡也能看見
Micheal wants to see into the night

1043
00:56:56,404 --> 00:56:59,404
{\a6}迪奧 畢博，攝影師
（落日殺神 / 綠燈俠 / 芝加哥）

1044
00:56:56,404 --> 00:57:02,074
對於數位攝影機來說這是大顯身手的時間
and that point is really best time for digital cameras

1045
00:57:02,075 --> 00:57:08,105
把（攝影）邊界推向數位攝影機所擅長的方面
twit up and pushed the boundry on what digital was capable of

1046
00:57:09,909 --> 00:57:11,952
<i>《落日殺神》有意思在哪
Collateral is interesting that</i>

1047
00:57:12,249 --> 00:57:15,128
它看起來完全是我們所見的那種
it was suppose to look exactly the way it looks

1048
00:57:18,833 --> 00:57:22,037
室外的紐約在晚上不是黑的
The New York outside at night you don't see black

1049
00:57:22,037 --> 00:57:26,091
你可以看見整個城市有
You see all around the city of

1050
00:57:26,093 --> 00:57:31,016
綠色，桃紅，紫色的光和天空的霧靄
Green, magenta, purple lights and haze in the sky

1051
00:57:31,017 --> 00:57:32,687
你可以看見所有這些瘋狂的顏色
you just see all these crazy colors

1052
00:57:32,688 --> 00:57:36,217
能夠捕捉這樣的影像，只能用數位攝影機
the only way that capture them at that time was digitally

1053
00:57:39,000 --> 00:57:41,972
現在都在說晚上攝影的事
you got a lot of this on night talking on photography going now

1054
00:57:42,265 --> 00:57:45,739
不過就是用了不同感光度的CCD
this just using the different sensitivities of your CCD chips

1055
00:57:46,063 --> 00:57:49,128
晚上能夠捕捉更多的紫外線
it seizes a little more UV spectrum

1056
00:57:49,129 --> 00:57:54,347
所以就鼓勵電影人去拍不同的夜景
so you got film makers try to use that to give a different ascetic to night time lighting

1057
00:57:54,348 --> 00:57:58,201
不過對我來說這些還是和錄影差不多
(?)but to me it's still of all we're telling the flame of video

1058
00:57:58,644 --> 00:58:02,824
響尾蛇攝影機的出現告訴我
the viper was the first camera that really told me that

1059
00:58:03,000 --> 00:58:06,995
數位時代強勁崛起
the digital age was right jetting up in a tensity

1060
00:58:07,000 --> 00:58:10,204
數位攝影機競爭將隨即而至
I can see the foot race and the cameras coming

1061
00:58:11,766 --> 00:58:17,849
2005年，Panavision，膠卷攝影機製造的先驅
In 2005, Panavision, an established force in the film camera business

1062
00:58:17,850 --> 00:58:23,097
進行了對單感光元件攝影機的一系列動作
Made a serial push into digital with large sensor of single chip camera

1063
00:58:23,100 --> 00:58:26,069
我們開始將這視作一種真正的影片格式
We started looking at this as real format

1064
00:58:26,069 --> 00:58:29,069
{\a6}鮑勃 哈威，Panavision全球市場部高級副總裁

1065
00:58:26,069 --> 00:58:31,642
我們覺得最好是我們來設計一台
And we decided the best thing we can do is design

1066
00:58:31,650 --> 00:58:34,661
我叫它“能用影帶的膠卷攝影機”
What I used to call it a film camera that takes tape

1067
00:58:35,179 --> 00:58:38,569
<i>然後我們開始著手於“Genesis”
And that's when we started drawing up the genesis</i>

1068
00:58:38,569 --> 00:58:41,569
{\a6}設備：Panavision Genesis，2005

1069
00:58:39,787 --> 00:58:43,503
“Genesis”具有全幅45mm晶片
“Genesis” is a full frame, 45mm chip

1070
00:58:43,510 --> 00:58:47,543
這可以使影像獲得和膠卷相似的景深
that allows depth of field very similar to film

1071
00:58:49,663 --> 00:58:52,635
而且可以使用我們的45mm鏡頭
And we can use all our 45mm lenses

1072
00:58:52,636 --> 00:58:55,422
總共有上千種
Which total for thousands, literally

1073
00:58:55,423 --> 00:58:58,921
我們和索尼合作
And we went to the work partner up to SONY on it

1074
00:58:58,922 --> 00:59:02,404
他們負責設計電器元件
they design the electronics and we put it together

1075
00:59:02,405 --> 00:59:05,701
接著第一台被用於電影正片製作的
and we introduced the first full frame digital camera

1076
00:59:05,900 --> 00:59:07,651
全幅攝影機就誕生了
For making feature films

1077
00:59:08,110 --> 00:59:10,850
“Genesis”的畫質超級高，因為潘那維申製造嘛
The “genesis” was high to hell because it's from Panavision

1078
00:59:10,851 --> 00:59:14,054
還有潘那維申專用特級系統
And it was so designing A system for Panavision

1079
00:59:14,100 --> 00:59:18,141
最好的是還能使用潘那維申的鏡頭
The good about it was it took Panavision lenses

1080
00:59:18,150 --> 00:59:20,509
具有全幅感光元件
It was with a 35mm sensor

1081
00:59:20,510 --> 00:59:24,085
而“響尾蛇”的只是2/3英吋感光元件
While the viper used 2/3'' sensor

1082
00:59:24,874 --> 00:59:27,874
{\a6}超人再起，2006

1083
00:59:24,874 --> 00:59:28,729
人們想獲得和35mm膠卷一樣的感受
people wanted the same feel same look they got from 35mm

1084
00:59:28,730 --> 00:59:30,401
“Genesis”能夠做到
which caught what you got with “genesis”

1085
00:59:30,402 --> 00:59:32,909
而且畫面超好
And it gave pretty good images

1086
00:59:32,910 --> 00:59:36,206
這是我們為電影製作精心設計的
We were very careful to design it for film crews

1087
00:59:36,300 --> 00:59:40,339
要是說對比以前有什麼變化
So the transition, if there's going to be one

1088
00:59:40,500 --> 00:59:43,032
那就是製作電影更加簡便
Would be easy for the people making movies

1089
00:59:43,529 --> 00:59:47,955
<i>迪恩塞姆勒因為《與狼共舞》獲得了學院獎
Dean Semler who was academic award cinematographer, financer of dance with wolves</i>

1090
00:59:48,090 --> 00:59:50,784

where the tempreture was 100 degrees and humility was 200

1093
00:59:54,500 --> 00:59:57,378
而且基本沒變化（不停工）
And never had a second of down time

1094
00:59:57,379 --> 00:59:59,236
他感覺這就和攝影機一樣
He felt it was like a film camera

35磅重
It's 35 ponds

1096

他媽的破機器有這麼大
Fucking cameras this big

1097
01:00:05,845 --> 01:00:09,653
在頂上還有一個像膠卷盒的東西
And on the top of it, it looks like film magazine

1098
01:00:09,807 --> 01:00:11,419
錄影機和機身連在一起
The recorder attached to it

1099
01:00:11,420 --> 01:00:14,915
和膠卷盒一樣
The same way the mag will attach at the top on the back

1100
01:00:14,916 --> 01:00:16,727
我想看看剛拍了什麼
I want to see what we just got shot

1101
01:00:17,372 --> 01:00:18,951
能重播嗎
does it a playback off that?

1102
01:00:18,952 --> 01:00:21,041
不能，就和底片一樣
no, you never touch that like original negative

1103
01:00:21,100 --> 01:00:22,295
我就直說了
so if you see I get straight

1104
01:00:22,296 --> 01:00:26,225
你和索尼在攝影機研發上花了幾百萬
you got to spend how many millions developing camera with SONY

1105
01:00:26,230 --> 01:00:30,311
然後你告訴我不能回播
and I can't play the HD back to look at it

1106
01:00:30,312 --> 01:00:31,379
因為這是底片嗎？
because that's the negative?

01:00:39,571 --> 01:00:42,464
所以取景的時候一定要小心
so we had to be careful on the sight

1113
01:00:42,541 --> 01:00:44,491
動態範圍是硬傷
dynamic range is veto

1114
01:00:44,473 --> 01:00:47,204
對我來說動態範圍比什麼都總要
dynamic range is more important than anything to me

1115
01:00:47,205 --> 01:00:49,805
這也拖慢了我換數位攝影的進程
so that really me slow down to shoot digitally

1116
01:00:49,900 --> 01:00:52,220
看看動態範圍的事吧
if you have thought of the range

1117
01:00:52,230 --> 01:00:55,378
要是黑與白本來的感覺是這樣
if the dark and bright is felt like this

1118
01:00:55,379 --> 01:00:58,379
{\a6}從海底出擊，1981，膠卷拍攝

1119
01:00:56,000 --> 01:00:57,253
要使用數位拍攝
as shoot in digital

1120
01:00:57,254 --> 01:00:59,390
就沒有這麼寬的範圍了
you don't have this wide range

1121
01:00:59,391 --> 01:01:02,873
填不滿光亮和黑暗之間的空間
which fill the heights between the blacks and the lights

1122
01:01:03,063 --> 01:01:05,478
所以亮些的沒有了
so whatever up here is cut off

1123
01:01:05,479 --> 01:01:07,707
暗些的也沒有了
and whatever down there is also cut off

1124
01:01:07,865 --> 01:01:10,865
{\a6}沃利 菲斯特，攝影師
（黑暗騎士 / 全面啟動 / 記憶拼圖）

1125
01:01:07,865 --> 01:01:12,834
我就是不知道它怎麼能能讓我達到想要的效果
I just don't feel how it is allowed to enable me to do what I want to do

1126
01:01:12,834 --> 01:01:15,834
{\a6}數位拍攝

1127
01:01:12,873 --> 01:01:17,431
你不能指望5檔過度曝光還能看到什麼
you can't overexpose by 5 stops and still have something in the image

1128
01:01:17,450 --> 01:01:22,400
你也不能指望4檔曝光不足還能看到些什麼
you can't underexpose it by 4 stops and still have traces in the image

1129
01:01:22,500 --> 01:01:25,054
我覺得只能是一片空白
I think you'll find plain in those areas

1130
01:01:27,196 --> 01:01:32,862
在2005年，吉姆詹納德，價值數十億的墨鏡和運動服飾公司
in 2005, Jim Jannard, the founder and owner of the multi billion-dollar

1131
01:01:32,863 --> 01:01:35,602
Oakley的創始人和擁有者
sunglass and sports apparel company, Oakley

1132
01:01:35,652 --> 01:01:40,153
開始製作一架面向影院市場的數位攝影機
set out to create a new cinematic affordable digital camera

1133
01:01:40,350 --> 01:01:43,350
{\a6}吉姆 詹那德，RED數位電影創始人

1134
01:01:40,350 --> 01:01:45,643
數位對膠卷不夠尊重
digital wasn't paying enough respect to film

1135
01:01:45,700 --> 01:01:47,918
也不如膠卷好
it wasn't as good as film

1136
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:51,731
對我來說一切皆可更好
and to me everything in the world can and will be made better

1137
01:01:51,732 --> 01:01:54,192
就看何時何人了
the only question is when and by whom

1138
01:01:55,000 --> 01:02:00,944
取代膠卷的運動開始了
there was a technological movements towards the eventual replacement of film

1139
01:02:01,597 --> 01:02:04,597
{\a6}泰德 施洛維茲，RED數位電影

1140
01:02:01,597 --> 01:02:04,894
當時的現象就是，主流廠商
what was happening in some of the major manufactures

1141
01:02:04,895 --> 01:02:08,795
都想在做自己的HD攝影產品
is they were creating video level tools essentially HD tools

1142
01:02:08,796 --> 01:02:12,231
並試圖將其推廣到電影市場
and tried to push that into the cinema

1143
01:02:12,400 --> 01:02:16,364
不過我們所看到的是這些產品都差很遠
and what we saw was that it's not any close to good enough

1144
01:02:16,500 --> 01:02:20,869
我們想定一個很高的目標，那樣才有意義
we want to set a high enough target so that was meaningful

1145
01:02:21,655 --> 01:02:23,234
這就是RED的本質
that's the nature of RED

1146
01:02:23,235 --> 01:02:26,856
我們想把膠卷送進養老院
we want to help to send the film to the retirement home

1147
01:02:26,857 --> 01:02:30,386
並用更好的來取代它
and have a few good about what took it place

1148
01:02:31,247 --> 01:02:36,030
2007年，RED 1面世
in 2007, the RED 1 was available to the public

1149
01:02:38,102 --> 01:02:43,211
在這個時代裡，數位攝影機可以拍攝比HD更高的圖元
this new generation, digital cameras could now shoot more resolution than HD

1150
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:47,762
把圖元數目從2K提高到4K
and increased pixels from 2k to 4k

1151
01:02:49,223 --> 01:02:53,915
當我看到RED的時候我想我真該給膠卷打個電話：你得來認識一下這傢伙
when I saw the RED I really thought I should call the film on the phone and said: met someone

1152
01:02:54,100 --> 01:02:57,954
因為我認為這就是未來
cause I really thought this is the future

1153
01:02:57,955 --> 01:03:00,955
{\a6}切格瓦拉，2008

1154
01:02:59,215 --> 01:03:03,069
無論解析度、場景曲線還是看起來的感覺
the resolution, the curve, the way it saw like

1155
01:03:03,070 --> 01:03:05,159
都是全新的
I just felt this is a new thing

1156
01:03:05,160 --> 01:03:09,803
<i>所以我堅持要用它來拍攝《切格瓦拉》
and I was insisted that we shoot CHE on it</i>

1157
01:03:11,859 --> 01:03:16,689
數位技術在一開始很爛，每個人都知道
digital at the beginning was really bad, everybody knew that

1158
01:03:16,689 --> 01:03:19,689
{\a6}維爾莫斯 齊格蒙德，攝影師
（ 越戰獵鹿人 / 激流四勇士 / 雌雄賭徒）

1159
01:03:16,700 --> 01:03:23,219
這部比以前的要好
that kind of that camera which was better than previous ones

1160
01:03:23,300 --> 01:03:27,538
至少便宜，但是還是不夠好
at least it was cheaper, ok, but it's not good enough

1161
01:03:27,943 --> 01:03:32,077
因為總是有經驗不足的問題
actually there is a experience limitation of that

1162
01:03:33,072 --> 01:03:37,577
它的確存在問題，它打壓了小廠競爭，它是台電腦
(?)it has problems, it crushed occasion of the mob, it's a computer

1163
01:03:37,578 --> 01:03:42,161
但是RED不顧膠卷攝影機的屍體曾經怎樣
but then again RED ignored everything about normal film camera bodies

1164
01:03:42,162 --> 01:03:44,345
轉而使用自己覺得正確的東西
and use what they thought was right

1165
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:47,925
最壞的情況也就是
even with the worst stories of being out

1166
01:03:47,925 --> 01:03:50,867
因為過熱把所有東西上敷個冰袋
is that the heating had a ice pack on all that stuff

1167
01:03:50,700 --> 01:03:52,198
不過我不在乎
none of that bother me

1168
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:55,588
因為得到的實在特別
because the get was so significant

1169
01:03:55,667 --> 01:04:00,450
很多天內都不用在100多度的情況下
in this case, not having to log film magazines up and down

1170
01:04:00,451 --> 01:04:03,515
用手把膠卷盒拿進拿出
this for days on hand in hundred degree

1171
01:04:03,516 --> 01:04:06,533
是不是能用快閃記憶體拍攝不重要
whether they are able to shoot on flash card

1172
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:09,181
換儲存盒只要50秒
change magazines in 50 seconds

1173
01:04:09,220 --> 01:04:11,874
這就已經是不錯的冷卻了
that alone was huge frost

1174
01:04:11,878 --> 01:04:14,242
也能讓拍出的畫面更好
it resulted in a better movie

1175
01:04:06,600 --> 01:04:11,874
{\a6}*RED 1採用磁碟陣列或CF卡儲存，相對膠卷和錄影帶拍攝時間大大延長*

1176
01:04:17,228 --> 01:04:21,175
我很喜歡吉姆詹那德這次的設計，我喜歡他們公司的理念
I really love the Jim Jannard's doing, I love what their company's about

1177
01:04:21,176 --> 01:04:25,308
我喜歡他們使用的技術，這不僅僅是
and I love the tech they took, that's very much no holds barred like

1178
01:04:25,309 --> 01:04:29,906
“捲起袖子看熱鬧”而已
let's roll up our sleeves let's get it in and up to our eyeballs, let's figure this shit out

1179
01:04:29,700 --> 01:04:32,700
{\a6}社群網戰，2010

1180
01:04:30,911 --> 01:04:35,217
RED 1有9磅，加鏡頭14磅
RED 1 is 9 pounds when put up lens on it is 14 pounds

1181
01:04:35,220 --> 01:04:40,279
<i>拍《社群網戰》的時候很多時候要拍那些小船
on Social Network I went too many seconds I got to shoot these tiny boats</i>

1182
01:04:40,300 --> 01:04:42,369
我覺得它們輕的就像薯片一樣
and I think it's like potato chips

1183
01:04:42,370 --> 01:04:48,824
所以我不能把30磅重的設備放到船頂的帆上
and I can't add 30 pounds a camera out on this side sail top on this boat

1184
01:04:48,825 --> 01:04:50,774
然後他說：“好吧，你要我怎麼做”
he said “ Ok what you want me to do”

1185
01:04:50,775 --> 01:04:53,748
我說：“你自己拿著，或者和別人搭夥
I said “you got to take one, you got to board out you got

1186
01:04:53,749 --> 01:04:55,746
不管怎樣你要想出辦法
whatever you got to do you have to figure out the way

1187
01:04:55,747 --> 01:04:58,625
給我個印第賽車版的RED 1”
you got to give me the indycar version of the RED 1”

1188
01:04:55,747 --> 01:04:58,625
{\a6}*印地賽車是美國的方程式賽車，相對重量較輕*

1189
01:04:59,156 --> 01:05:01,432
這是在週五
this was on Friday

1190
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,275
周日他就打電話給我說：
on Sunday, he called me and said:

1191
01:05:04,276 --> 01:05:08,780
“我用碳纖做了個機身，你什麼時候來拿，就在我桌上”
“I made one of body in carbon fibers, when you can have about it, it's on my desk”

1192
01:05:09,379 --> 01:05:13,327
然後用上的時候，這東西只有5磅半
and went down, and pick up to it and they were 5 and a half pounds

1193
01:05:13,575 --> 01:05:16,176
這在電影業中從未出現過
that never existed before for film cameras

1194
01:05:16,177 --> 01:05:19,845
這麼快的回應
this sort of immediate calling responds

1195
01:05:20,175 --> 01:05:24,216
在電影製作人和攝影機製作人之間
between the people who are shooting and the people who are creating the cameras

1196
01:05:24,216 --> 01:05:27,216
{\a6}貧民百萬富翁，2008

1197
01:05:26,624 --> 01:05:29,782
我迫切的想要製作點充滿新鮮空氣的東西
I was desperate to make something that had all the fresh air in

1198
01:05:29,783 --> 01:05:32,615
尤其是你去印度孟買的時候
and cause when you go to India in Bombay especially

1199
01:05:32,616 --> 01:05:37,200
鮮活的生命氣息撲面而來，對你狂叫著
it's got life, it's just coming screaming on you all the time in everywhere

1200
01:05:37,201 --> 01:05:41,280
丹尼激動的產生了一個想法，我們應該在劇本中
Danny come to an idea, rage, come to an idea of speed energy use

1201
01:05:41,281 --> 01:05:44,630
用到速度和活力的元素
and that's what we need on the script

1202
01:05:44,631 --> 01:05:47,430
跑，對，這就是我們要在印度用的
and then running, that's it, that's we use in India

1203
01:05:47,431 --> 01:05:50,313
那真是世界上最神奇的地方
it's just the most wonderful place of the world

1204
01:05:50,314 --> 01:05:55,283
我們想要製作一部與眾不同的電影，如果攝影機能實現那一點的話
for a different kind film we wanted the camera would trying somehow catch a bit of that

1205
01:05:55,284 --> 01:05:58,998
就是要找一部攝影機，任務明確了
it's about finding camera, the task is there, it's clear

1206
01:05:58,999 --> 01:06:05,453
我要做的就是用我狂妄自大又符合正統的經驗去找到一件工具
my job is to find, with all my anarchic and conventional experience there, to find a tool

1207
01:06:05,453 --> 01:06:08,453
{\a6}設備：矽映 SI-2K，2007

1208
01:06:05,842 --> 01:06:09,232
像矽映SI-2K這樣的攝影機
cameras like Silicon Imaging SI-2K

1209
01:06:09,233 --> 01:06:12,204
可以到達對於膠卷攝影機和早期
have been able to go places and get shots that

1210
01:06:12,205 --> 01:06:17,127
高解析度攝影機非常難以到達的地點進行拍攝
would have been very difficult with film or earlier versions of HD cameras

1211
01:06:17,128 --> 01:06:20,730
這裡有個電腦感光元件在後面
it's a sensor of computer back on it

1212
01:06:20,740 --> 01:06:23,294
你想要把攝影機做的看起來像電腦一樣嗎
so do you make a computer look like a film camera?

1213
01:06:23,666 --> 01:06:29,006
或者你會把攝影機線拔掉，和筆記型電腦連接在一起？
or do you say: “the hell of that, take this and ease that cable and connected into a laptop”

1214
01:06:29,007 --> 01:06:31,387
這就是SI攝影機的本事
and that will be the SI camera was

1215
01:06:31,388 --> 01:06:34,348
單憑這點世界上還沒有如此之小的攝影機能夠做到
at that point no one camera in the world is small enough

1216
01:06:34,348 --> 01:06:37,348
{\a6}阿里 普萊斯勒，矽映總裁

1217
01:06:34,349 --> 01:06:39,642
安東尼想要在大街上追著孩子們跑
Anthony wanted to run into the streets and track the children as they were running

1218
01:06:39,643 --> 01:06:43,032
還得是和小孩一樣的高度
and be as the same height level as the kids

1219
01:06:43,033 --> 01:06:48,101
所以他們把筆記型電腦帶上裝包裡
so they took macbook pros and put them into a bag pack

1220
01:06:48,300 --> 01:06:52,022
用作捕捉和記錄的系統
to use for their capture and recording system

1221
01:06:53,184 --> 01:06:58,849
膠卷攝影機，就算從穩固架或起重機上卸下來
film cameras, even when off the legs or off the steadicam or off the crane

1222
01:06:58,850 --> 01:07:00,893
還是要和攝影者的身體連接在一起
still connected on the camera man's body

1223
01:07:00,894 --> 01:07:03,633
他或者就這麼追著你跑
he's either chasing you down the street

1224
01:07:03,634 --> 01:07:07,162
或者把東西架在這然後轉身帶著那一大堆東西回來
or he's got it here, or he turns round and runs back with things like that

1225
01:07:07,163 --> 01:07:09,484
不過用SI-2K就動能做到
with this SI-2K you can do that

1226
01:07:11,849 --> 01:07:13,985
因為它不再連著攝影者的身體了
it's no longer connected to the camera man's body

1227
01:07:13,986 --> 01:07:15,563
你能做好多其他的事
you can do different things with that

1228
01:07:15,564 --> 01:07:19,500
在片場可以真正做到“自由發揮”
during the scene it's just literally improvising

1229
01:07:26,364 --> 01:07:32,819
<i>2009年，《貧民百萬富翁》獲得了最佳攝影學院獎
in 2009, slum dog millionaire won the academic award for best cinematography</i>

1230
01:07:33,308 --> 01:07:39,075
這是該獎項第一次頒發給幾乎全程使用數位技術拍攝的電影
it was the first time that award was giving to a movie shot almost entirely on digital camera

1231
01:07:39,342 --> 01:07:41,106
所以既然您獲得了學院獎
so you had the academic award

1232
01:07:41,107 --> 01:07:47,562
您覺得數位拍攝是否已經被主流接受了呢
so do you feel like that the film make digital be accepted by the main stream now?

1233
01:07:47,563 --> 01:07:51,185
<i>《貧民》在評論界和觀眾當中的成功
the success of the slum dog<i > with critics and audience</i>

1234
01:07:51,190 --> 01:07:55,044
代表了一個時代的某些特點
symbolizes something of an epoque

1235
01:07:55,045 --> 01:08:00,271
也算是為數位拍攝打定了基礎
it perhaps puts hammers and stakes a little bit in the ground

1236
01:08:00,272 --> 01:08:03,682
這樣看來數位格式已經被接受了
this far was acceptance of digital format

1237
01:08:03,683 --> 01:08:06,659
這是第一個對大規模使用數位技術的獎項
it was the first really acknowledgement on the large scale of digital

1238
01:08:06,918 --> 01:08:09,286
為此我非常為安東尼高興
I was very pleased for Anthony for that

1239
01:08:09,287 --> 01:08:13,559
因為我以為他會覺得他永遠也不能拿到這個獎
because I think he felt it was some acknowledgement he would never arrive at

1240
01:08:13,560 --> 01:08:16,902
因為他是如此特立獨行於數位世界
because he's chosen to specialized too much in the digital world

1241
01:08:16,903 --> 01:08:20,210
不過現在他的成就改變了所有人的看法
I think that was where he goes and everybody changed

1242

{\a6}阿凡達，2009
設備：SONY F950

1247
01:08:35,108 --> 01:08:37,430
<i>《阿凡達》本來是我在《鐵達尼號》之後的下一部電影
avatar was gonna be my next movie after titanic</i>

1248
01:08:37,431 --> 01:08:40,310
所以在99年的時候我想把它拍成3D的
so I converted to think about it shoot in 3D in ‘99

1249
01:08:40,853 --> 01:08:46,101
我立刻就想到能在未來拍攝3D的唯一方法就是數位拍攝
I knew immediately that the only way to shoot 3D, the future of shooting 3D is digital

1250
01:08:46,682 --> 01:08:50,351
我們做了個實驗，我們把2部高解析度攝影機並排放在一塊
we're starting to an experiment, we took 2 HD cameras side by side

1251
01:08:50,766 --> 01:08:52,716
我覺得結果還是相當酷的
I thought the result was pretty cool

1252
01:08:53,538 --> 01:08:56,610
接著我就和佩斯合作建立起了自己的攝影系統
then with Pace I built the vision camera system

1253
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:04,690
一台攝影機放在這，另一台放到頂端
we've decided to put one camera here and another camera on top

1254
01:09:05,104 --> 01:09:08,819
那應該怎麼整合這兩個呢
so what happened in here to marry this two

1255
01:09:08,820 --> 01:09:12,130
因為從觀測上說是需要兩個畫面的對吧？
cause there scopicly you need two images exist right?

1256
01:09:12,131 --> 01:09:13,125
沒錯
correct

1257
01:09:13,496 --> 01:09:16,692
我們有一個問題就是在攝影機較大的時候
one of the problems we have was the larger camera is a fact

1258
01:09:16,693 --> 01:09:19,943
我們不能像我們兩眼位置一樣把他們並排放置
that we wouldn't put them side by side like your 2 eyeballs, right

1259
01:09:18,178 --> 01:09:21,178
{\a6}文森 佩斯，卡佩3D技術CEO

1260
01:09:19,944 --> 01:09:23,240
你不能在現實世界把兩架攝影機這麼放
you couldn't put those cameras physically in that position

1261
01:09:23,241 --> 01:09:25,230
他們會撞到的
they will run in to each other

1262
01:09:25,231 --> 01:09:28,302
所以我們利用鏡面反射
so we use reflect of a mirror

1263
01:09:28,997 --> 01:09:33,362
這樣在你的腦海裡
and then that allows us to overlaid the 2 camera systems

1264
01:09:33,363 --> 01:09:35,637
兩架攝影機的實際位置可以重疊
of your imagine form a physical stand point

1265
01:09:35,638 --> 01:09:39,600
而這樣就不再有兩眼間距離的限制
where there is no limitation how close we get these eyes together

1266
01:09:39,601 --> 01:09:42,697
而這一點對3D來說是非常重要的
and that's really important to 3D

1267
01:09:43,535 --> 01:09:45,299
要製作3D效果
to create 3D

1268
01:09:45,300 --> 01:09:49,247
兩架攝影機要像兩隻眼睛一樣
2 cameras works a pair just like our 2 eyes

1269
01:09:49,248 --> 01:09:52,590
從稍微不同的角度獲取畫面
they capture pictures from slightly different angle

1270
01:09:52,591 --> 01:09:56,259
從而製造三維空間的深度和廣度
providing the sense in 3 dimensional depth and distance

1271
01:09:56,260 --> 01:09:58,720
我有個圈內笑話
I have a joke of most people all around me

1272
01:09:58,721 --> 01:10:00,510
我屬於平面世界
I long for when the world was flat

1273
01:10:00,511 --> 01:10:03,800
因為不止適應系統要互相複製
because it's not only the cameras system duplicated

1274
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,600
製作流程上的每件事都要相互複製
everything duplicates down the chain, right

1275
01:10:06,601 --> 01:10:09,108
一個鏡頭控制另一個鏡頭
so lensing control over lensing

1276
01:10:09,608 --> 01:10:13,060
很多人說這要加倍的難搞，實際上不對
and a lot people said that's as twice as hard than that's incorrect statement

1277
01:10:13,061 --> 01:10:14,330
不止是這樣
that's more than that

1278
01:10:14,331 --> 01:10:17,642
因為兩架攝影機要像完全分不出來的雙胞胎那樣工作
because these 2 cameras have to operate like sign-missed twins

1279
01:10:17,643 --> 01:10:20,010
他們必須完美的複製對方
they have to mimic each other perfectly

1280
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:25,715
如果電影製作完成一切正常的話
I think when films are done right and when it really works is when

1281
01:10:25,716 --> 01:10:29,500
你會覺得身臨其境，自己就在那個旅程之中，完全進入在情節裡
you feels I'm there, I'm in this journey and immerged the story line

1282
01:10:29,501 --> 01:10:34,321
對我來說最有趣的地方在於把這個工具交給真正的創造之手
the fun part for me is to really get this tools in the creative hands

1283
01:10:34,322 --> 01:10:38,269
這樣就有人帶你去你從未想像過的地方了
so people can really take you to place that you never imagine before

1284
01:10:39,403 --> 01:10:43,583
<i>《阿凡達》出來的時候我真的很驕傲於它的畫面，太棒了
Avatar came out and I was really proud of those images, look gorgeous</i>

1285
01:10:44,484 --> 01:10:48,756
<i>緊接著《愛麗絲夢遊仙境》和《馴龍高手》也上映了
and it was followed up by Alice to wonderland and how to train your dragon</i>

1286
01:10:48,990 --> 01:10:53,726
邦邦邦，市場上接二連三出現了3部3D電影
boo boo boo, 3 movies on the markets one after another and all of them were (?)

1287
01:10:53,834 --> 01:10:56,156
而且都是年度票房大戶
the 3 of them were the top grossing films of the year

1288
01:10:56,157 --> 01:11:01,266
所以突然間大門敞開了
so all of a sudden the door just blow wide open on the whole thing

1289
01:11:01,267 --> 01:11:05,260
人們看到了這裡的市場前景
people really saw the potential of this as a market

1290
01:11:05,261 --> 01:11:08,923
電影消費提升了觀眾
this consumptions of films has increased our audiences

1291
01:11:08,924 --> 01:11:11,857
的觀影品味和理解能力
both appetite for them and now knowledge of them

1292
01:11:11,858 --> 01:11:14,644
所以想要製作驚人之作越來越難了
so therefore it's getting harder and harder to impress

1293
01:11:15,206 --> 01:11:17,621
這就是3D為什麼這麼流行的原因之一
it's one of the reasons why 3D's taking off

1294
01:11:17,622 --> 01:11:20,407
換個口味看電影而已
just a way looking at a film

1295
01:11:20,408 --> 01:11:24,679
演員如同一尊雕塑，就是會走會動呼之欲出
the actor is like a sculpture or something only it's moving and comes out

1296
01:11:24,680 --> 01:11:28,582
就像從劇院到電影，從無聲到有聲之類的一樣
and like a combination when theater went film, music and everything

1297
01:11:29,628 --> 01:11:33,482
我恨3D，我帶上了眼鏡會覺得反胃
I hate 3D, I put on those glasses and I get sick in my stomach

1298
01:11:33,483 --> 01:11:35,665
黑的什麼也看不清
it's too dark looking through them

1299
01:11:35,666 --> 01:11:39,937
整個的3D現象實際上就是他媽的市場炒作難道不是嗎？
the whole 3D phenomenon is a marketing fucking scheme isn't it?

1300
01:11:39,940 --> 01:11:41,532
作為一個旁觀者我可以肯定的說
I can safely say as a viewer

1301
01:11:41,533 --> 01:11:43,483
我完全不感興趣
I'm totally uninterested in it

1302
01:11:43,484 --> 01:11:45,990
丁點興趣也沒有
I'm without any interests whatsoever

1303
01:11:45,991 --> 01:11:47,244
我覺得這就是一時火爆
I think it's a fad

1304
01:11:47,245 --> 01:11:48,777
早晚燒個精光
I think it will burn out

1305
01:11:48,778 --> 01:11:52,167
電影工作室把什麼都做成3D是不明智的
the studio's not wise to slap 3D on everything

1306
01:11:52,893 --> 01:11:56,423
<i>《阿凡達》之所以做成3D是有原因的
with Avatar there is a reason this movie is in 3D</i>

1307
01:11:57,033 --> 01:11:59,450
它要給你一種體驗
because it's taking you on an experience

1308
01:11:59,451 --> 01:12:05,350
不是為了賺錢、嘩眾取寵或者玩把戲
it isn't something that was on for money or a joke or a gimmick

1309
01:12:06,158 --> 01:12:09,780
因為它是被創作成那個樣子的
it's there because it was created that way

1310
01:12:10,973 --> 01:12:13,992
<i>《阿凡達》結合了兩種完全不同的電影製作方式
Avatar is 2 completed different forms of film making combine</i>

1311
01:12:13,993 --> 01:12:16,314
我們只實際拍攝了1/3的內容
we only use lenses for about 1/3 of the movement

1312
01:12:16,315 --> 01:12:19,240
都是普通的東西
it all sets in just normal stuff

1313
01:12:19,241 --> 01:12:21,128
燈光，佈景，拍5場
(?)lighting, mural, 5 action

1314
01:12:21,453 --> 01:12:24,332
其餘的2/3是特效
it was virtual FX to the other 2/3

1315
01:12:25,882 --> 01:12:28,434
我們從來沒去真的叢林，我們創造了一個叢林
we never shot a real jungle, we have create a jungle

1316
01:12:28,435 --> 01:12:29,736
都是建模
it's all peer modeling

1317
01:12:29,737 --> 01:12:32,848
每個草葉每隻蹦來蹦去的蟲子
every blade of grass, every bug bouncing around

1318
01:12:32,849 --> 01:12:37,074
沒有一個是真實叢林的場景
not one foot film shot in a real jungle

1319
01:12:38,000 --> 01:12:43,897
數學建模能完美創造真實世界
you have this idea that you could hold a mathematically perfect model for creating reality

1320
01:12:43,898 --> 01:12:47,520
只要電腦和軟體就好
you just threw on the computing power at it, you just put software on it

1321
01:12:47,589 --> 01:12:50,004
我們就是這麼幹的，我們要求
cause it's all we found, we required

1322
01:12:50,005 --> 01:12:55,577
藝術家和攝影師研究光在物體上如何反射
artist and people who trained in photography looking at how light interact with those things

1323
01:12:55,578 --> 01:12:59,014
然後以此為基礎寫程式碼，創造一個看起來很逼真的世界
to figure out how to write the code, to make it look real

1324
01:12:59,378 --> 01:13:03,850
數位操控帶給眼睛的幻覺
what I find was that the manipulations the digital made your eyes to do

1325
01:13:04,863 --> 01:13:08,020
的確很引人入勝但卻很空洞
they are all seductive but alternately a little bit hollow

1326
01:13:08,021 --> 01:13:10,993
我常用的一個比喻是我想起有個夏天
the analogy I used t use was I remember the summer when

1327
01:13:10,994 --> 01:13:15,986
玉米油可以讓巧克力餅乾很軟
chips oil give these chocolate cookies (?) soft

1328
01:13:15,987 --> 01:13:18,215
這很不錯啊，讓餅乾變軟
that's amazing, just soft cookie and

1329
01:13:18,216 --> 01:13:19,955
不過幾個月過後
and then after a couple of months

1330
01:13:19,956 --> 01:13:23,392
在上面的完全是一坨化學XX
what's on it is some horrible chemical crap

1331
01:13:23,393 --> 01:13:26,434
開始只是給了你美好的幻想
give you bad illusion it fooled you first

1332
01:13:26,435 --> 01:13:30,382
我所擔心的是現在大規模使用CGI
my concern is that the image alternately with CGI

1333
01:13:30,470 --> 01:13:35,068
我們的年輕人也許不會再相信電影螢幕上的任何東西了
I don't know the younger generation is believing anything anymore on screen

1334
01:13:35,489 --> 01:13:37,254
都不是真實的
it's not real

1335
01:13:37,255 --> 01:13:42,455
你呈現了一個感覺真實卻完全不是真實的世界
you are presenting complete unreality and make them feel like it was real

1336
01:13:42,456 --> 01:13:45,473
甚至都先於拍攝任何真實場景…
and before it was captured in reality…

1337
01:13:45,474 --> 01:13:49,792
好吧，你也進過不少片場吧
alright, you've been on a couple of movie sets

1338
01:13:50,440 --> 01:13:51,973
真實過嗎
when was it ever real?

1339
01:13:51,974 --> 01:13:54,573
一堵牆，什麼也沒有
there was a kind of wall, there is nothing over there

1340
01:13:54,574 --> 01:13:56,240
30個人忙忙碌碌
there were 30 people stand around

1341
01:13:56,241 --> 01:13:59,961
一個拿著麥克風，一個在梯子上的人把屁股溝露出來了(=  =)
a guy with a boom mic, the other guy upon a ladder with his ass crack hanging out

1342
01:13:59,962 --> 01:14:06,399
還有個起重機，紐約的夜晚可能是伯班克的白天
there is a sit crane, your street night exterior New York was a day exterior Burbank

1343
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:07,513

在老的拍攝技法中我們更為靈活
we are free of the old technology of capturing images

1346
01:14:15,241 --> 01:14:19,327
攝影機，膠卷，鏡頭，曝光
camera, film, lens, exposure

1347
01:14:19,328 --> 01:14:23,878
我能掌控很多，有更多選擇，更多點子
it give me more control, more choice, more wits

所以現在的情況是從來沒出現過的
so that really put this in a positions of like never before

1362

同時拓展了藝術和技術

數位技術真的很厲害
that was great about the digital technology

it all becomes very simple, it just be a matter of time

1367
01:15:28,884 --> 01:15:31,025
因為數位技術在不斷進步
cause digital is gonna continue to improve

我喜歡看這些廠商競爭
I love that all these manufactures are competing against each other

1372

1379
01:16:08,184 --> 01:16:11,899
90年代中期的時候，ARRI生產的還全是傳統化學底片攝影機
up untill the mid-90s, for ARRI, it was all photo chemical

1380
01:16:11,900 --> 01:16:14,900
{\a6}葛籣 康奈，ARRI - 首席技師

1381
01:16:11,900 --> 01:16:15,285
當我覺得數位技術已經成熟
we solve the digital technology mature to a point that were

1382
01:16:15,286 --> 01:16:17,792
我們也開始發展自己的數位攝影機
we began and invite the digital technology

1383
01:16:17,800 --> 01:16:20,950
我們用在ALEXA上的感光元件
the sensor that we used now on the ALEXA camara

1384
01:16:20,951 --> 01:16:23,951
{\a6}設備：ARRI ALEXA，2010

1385
01:16:20,951 --> 01:16:25,981
讓我們驕傲的說，其拍攝品質足以製作電影正片
allowed us to offer a camera that we can proudly promote as a feature film camera

1386
01:16:26,349 --> 01:16:29,135
ALEXA擁有所有令我們興奮的元素
the ALEXA takes all of that we are excited about

1387
01:16:29,136 --> 01:16:33,501
在電影製作中可以帶來膠卷具有的質感
in film making and brings those textural qualities that film has

1388
01:16:33,502 --> 01:16:35,766
及熟悉的色彩表現
brings that definitely familiar color space

1389
01:16:35,767 --> 01:16:40,736
最近我才對ALEXA感興趣，因為他是ARRI的新產品
and only recently I'm realy interested in ALEXA made by Arriflex not heard

1390
01:16:40,897 --> 01:16:44,845
而且和用膠卷拍攝沒什麼不同
that it's like shooting film with digital format

1391
01:16:44,846 --> 01:16:47,677
非要我使用數位拍攝的話
if I'm push to shoot on digital

1392
01:16:47,680 --> 01:16:52,094
我會用ALEXA，因為可以得到很好的效果
I will take the ALEXA and that could help me get good result

1393
01:16:49,215 --> 01:16:52,215
{\a6}雨果，2011
設備：ARRIALEXA

1394
01:16:52,216 --> 01:16:55,216
{\a6}落日車神，2011
設備：ARRIALEXA

1395
01:16:55,217 --> 01:16:57,217
{\a6}驚悚末日，2011
設備：ARRIALEXA

1396
01:16:57,218 --> 01:16:59,218
{\a6}時間規劃局，2011
設備：ARRIALEXA

1397
01:16:59,630 --> 01:17:01,906
這是RED的新產品，我們叫它EPIC
this is the new RED, we just call it EPIC, so

1398
01:17:01,907 --> 01:17:07,479
信不信由你，可是比RED 1提高了60%的圖元
this is, believe it or not, 60% more resolution than the RED 1

1399
01:17:09,717 --> 01:17:11,899
吉姆詹那德給我看他的新產品EPIC
when Jim Jannard showed me the EPIC

1400
01:17:11,900 --> 01:17:13,432
我看著它說：“等等，
I looked at it and I said: “ wait a minute

1401
01:17:13,450 --> 01:17:15,104
“這個能幹什麼？
“what did that do?

1402
01:17:15,200 --> 01:17:18,715
“能怎麼幫助你說故事？”
“how could that free you as a story teller”

1403
01:17:18,716 --> 01:17:21,716
{\a6}龍紋身的女孩，2011
設備：RED EPIC

1404
01:17:23,226 --> 01:17:26,226
{\a6}超凡蜘蛛人，2012
設備：RED EPIC

1405
01:17:23,226 --> 01:17:25,548
它能拍攝非常美麗、豐富、
this camera created those beautiful, rich,

1406
01:17:25,549 --> 01:17:29,449
自然或者說格調獨特的顏色
very natural or very stylisticly wonderful colors

1407
01:17:26,837 --> 01:17:29,837
{\a6}哈比人，2012
設備：RED EPIC

1408
01:17:31,093 --> 01:17:36,387
我們要用解析度4K的放映機在超大螢幕上放映
we've taken a digitally projective 4k images on a gigantic screen

1409
01:17:36,556 --> 01:17:38,738
那效果一定震人心魄
and it is absolutely mind-blowing

1410
01:17:40,000 --> 01:17:44,086
影院的運輸方式要改變了
the delivery system of cinema is going to change

1411
01:17:44,100 --> 01:17:51,795
這比攝影機本身更令我興奮
and that's actually more exciting a way for me beside the actual camera

1412
01:17:52,715 --> 01:17:55,780
因為那種老掉牙的一套：
cause the ancient system of

1413
01:17:55,900 --> 01:18:00,496
送電影上卡車，到不同的城市，再卸貨
film on a truck driving into a city and unloading it

1414
01:18:00,497 --> 01:18:01,936
要被取代了
that being replaced

1415
01:18:02,392 --> 01:18:08,197
運送巨大的膠卷鐵盒子到處跑是相當費錢的
the old way of having ship giant film case around is very very expensive

1416
01:18:09,409 --> 01:18:15,540
所以人們意識到如果使用數位放映
so the business realized that there was a tremendous possible savings

1417
01:18:15,541 --> 01:18:18,936
可以省一大筆錢
in digital delivery and digital projection

1418
01:18:20,336 --> 01:18:24,701
我們都想要母片，底片的第一版
we are all want the pristine print, first print of all the negative

1419
01:18:24,702 --> 01:18:26,326
不過這不可能
but we cannot have that

1420
01:18:26,327 --> 01:18:27,534
你必須拷貝
so you have to copy it

1421
01:18:27,610 --> 01:18:30,820
但是用數位放映就沒必要拷貝了
and the advance of DCP is not real copying

1422
01:18:30,830 --> 01:18:33,525
掃描完成後不需要複印
once it scanned, it doesn't get copied again

1423
01:18:33,882 --> 01:18:36,436
更像是克隆，完全一樣的東西
it's cloned, so it's exactly the same thing

1424
01:18:37,672 --> 01:18:40,041
我對數位放映機更有好感
I'm getting more impressed with digital projection

1425
01:18:40,042 --> 01:18:44,313
我不是技術帝
as much as…I'm not big on technology

1426
01:18:44,314 --> 01:18:47,007
但我覺得數位放映機的發展前景是極好的
I think digital projections will come a long way

1427
01:18:47,008 --> 01:18:53,787
過去的兩年我們賣了10000台數位放映機到影院
in the last 2 years we've sold 10,000 digital projectors into cinemas

1428
01:18:54,398 --> 01:18:57,138
全球都在換
the conversion is taking place globally

1429
01:18:57,139 --> 01:19:00,807
現在我們已經完成了50%
we were probably 50% or more there

1430
01:19:00,808 --> 01:19:03,825
剩下的很快就會完成
and the rest of the conversion will happen very quickly

1431
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:05,811
既然令人驚歎的電影已經製作出來
they produce gorgeous pictures

1432
01:19:05,812 --> 01:19:08,310
那麼我們就必須創造更好的表現方式
and you had to study building up a wave

1433
01:19:08,311 --> 01:19:12,777
所以我們要讓數位螢幕在2015年達到200000塊
that's why we're gonna up to 200,000 digital screens by 2015

1434
01:19:14,957 --> 01:19:20,948
傳統的印片方式岌岌可危
the model for printing film is endangered

1435
01:19:22,520 --> 01:19:26,839
但我不希望最終膠卷也是這樣
and ultimately I hope that it doesn't take film with it

1436
01:19:29,732 --> 01:19:32,091
小時候去看電影
as a kid, I went to the movies

1437
01:19:32,100 --> 01:19:35,249
坐下後看到紅色的幕簾
you sat down and looked at a big red curtain

1438
01:19:35,250 --> 01:19:37,199
接著幕簾拉開
and then that curtain parted

1439
01:19:39,475 --> 01:19:42,587
電影就開始了
and there is the movie was going to begin right?

1440
01:19:42,588 --> 01:19:45,588
{\a6}巴瑞 萊文森，導演
（恐怖海灣 / 少年福爾摩斯 / 雨人）

1441
01:19:42,588 --> 01:19:45,791
然後你驚呼：“天啊，真妙！”
and you went “oh, my gosh! oh, this is special!”

1442
01:19:46,201 --> 01:19:48,848
這是我童年時代的印象
that's my childhood image

1443
01:19:48,860 --> 01:19:50,520
如今這已經不是絕妙的事了
it's not special anymore

1444
01:19:50,530 --> 01:19:52,610
別的事取代它了
it's another thing

1445
01:19:52,611 --> 01:19:55,164
一個世紀以來電影院都跟教堂似的
in a way cinema was a church between a century

1446
01:19:55,165 --> 01:19:57,857
因為同樣是很多人進到一個又大又黑的房間
because we come to this large dark room and sit

1447
01:19:57,858 --> 01:20:00,179
看著螢幕想這會是個什麼故事
looked up and think what it would tell you

1448
01:20:00,180 --> 01:20:03,180
{\a6}卡薩布蘭卡，1942

1449
01:20:00,300 --> 01:20:04,717
好多關於穿衣、行為、怎麼討好女人和怎麼扮演英雄
enormous amount how to dress how to act be with woman how to act hero

1450
01:20:09,160 --> 01:20:11,250
那個時代的螢幕很不同
something is extraordinary about the scene

1451
01:20:11,251 --> 01:20:13,850
有40英呎高
at that age is 40 feet high

1452
01:20:14,221 --> 01:20:15,707
那麼大一塊螢幕
and in 40 feet high,

1453
01:20:15,720 --> 01:20:19,179
相對日常生活很多事都變得神奇起來
something mythic about it is beyond your everyday life

1454
01:20:19,328 --> 01:20:23,647
寬度也很廣，應該有80英呎
it's so much big huge span, it should be 80 feet wide

1455
01:20:23,648 --> 01:20:25,597
觀眾會被螢幕包圍
you should envelop the audience in the screen

1456
01:20:26,125 --> 01:20:28,494
因為那才是電影院.....對！ 那才是電影院
cause that's cinema--yeah, that's cinema

1457
01:20:28,510 --> 01:20:30,510
聲音也每時每刻包圍著你
and the sound around you every minute

1458
01:20:30,511 --> 01:20:34,086
我真是不明白為什麼有人喜歡在電腦上看電影
I mean why people want to watch movies on their computers I should never know

1459
01:20:36,000 --> 01:20:40,644
我經常在地鐵上看到有人用iPhone看電影，我就會想…
I see people watch movies on their iphone in subway all the time…

1460
01:20:41,552 --> 01:20:43,085
“別這樣作！”
and I went “---no!!!”

1461
01:20:44,000 --> 01:20:47,065
有人說這不是好事，不過也不一定非有那麼糟
who might say this is bad, it doesn't have to be bad

1462
01:20:47,066 --> 01:20:50,176
晚上我妻子睡了，我睡不著
late at night, my wife sleeps and I can't sleep

1463
01:20:50,177 --> 01:20:52,266
我就會拿起我的iPhone
and I put my xx on my iphone

1464
01:20:52,267 --> 01:20:55,641
再帶上副不錯的耳機，把螢幕幾乎貼臉的看電影
put up good headphone and watch films close to my face

1465
01:20:55,642 --> 01:20:57,452
這很有趣
and this sound interesting about that

1466
01:20:57,650 --> 01:21:00,292
一切都很私人
you‘ve got everything very privately

1467
01:21:00,293 --> 01:21:03,900
所以挺懷念想哭的卻不想人看見的時候
I think it was missing I want to cry without people seeing it

1468
01:21:03,901 --> 01:21:06,880
<i>我放《鋼木蘭》的時候哭了
I want to cry without people seeing it, I'll put the steel Magnolias</i>

1469
01:21:06,881 --> 01:21:09,720
要是我妻子醒了，我只好暫停，再藏到枕頭裡
and I cry and if my wife wakes up I just get pause and put it under a pillow

1470
01:21:09,721 --> 01:21:11,113
這很有趣
and get something interesting about that

1471
01:21:11,114 --> 01:21:13,899
因為以前不可能有機會經歷
because you didn't have a chance to experience before

1472
01:21:13,900 --> 01:21:16,900
{\a6}萊娜 杜漢，演員/導演
（微型傢俱）

1473
01:21:13,900 --> 01:21:16,681
約會已經不會有人問“去看電影吧”
You can ask on a date no body's like “let's get on the movies” any more

1474
01:21:16,682 --> 01:21:19,560
甚至現在已經是這樣的
I don't even felt that's going on, I felt like

1475
01:21:19,561 --> 01:21:22,840
人們會說“我們在床上看看Netflix有什麼吧”
people like “let's watch something on Netflix streaming on my bed” which

1476
01:21:19,561 --> 01:21:22,840
{\a6}*Netflix：相當於掌上影院*

1477
01:21:22,841 --> 01:21:25,500
然後一群24歲的年輕人就在床上等著
was 24 years old guys waiting to get you sit on their bed

1478
01:21:25,501 --> 01:21:27,550
不過這確實是正在發生的事情
but I think that's what's happening

1479
01:21:27,551 --> 01:21:31,452
我能看到正在上映的電影，能從平板電腦或其他的什麼上看任何電影
I can get any on movie I can get any movie from pad or anything

1480
01:21:31,453 --> 01:21:34,285
對我來說再自然不過，坐下就看
That's naturalest thing to me I can sit down and watching

1481
01:21:34,440 --> 01:21:37,750
不過會錯過很多細節，那就沒法感受電影的魅力了
but you will not see all the detail that you won't be able to feel it

1482
01:21:37,751 --> 01:21:39,329
比如說就沒法感受…
like if you be able to feel…

1483
01:21:39,330 --> 01:21:41,371
我的高解析度電視大著呢
my big HDTV is 20 big

1484
01:21:41,372 --> 01:21:44,285
你是說和女孩子親熱這類的東西嗎？
You mean go to see make up with girls like that

1485
01:21:44,286 --> 01:21:46,469
沒興趣，我早過了那個年齡了
But that, no, I'm way past that

1486
01:21:46,470 --> 01:21:47,398
真的嗎？
Are you sure?

1487
01:21:47,399 --> 01:21:48,744
相信我啦
Believe me

1488
01:21:48,745 --> 01:21:51,299
看電影的方式越來越多
So many different way for watching movie

1489
01:21:51,300 --> 01:21:54,271
分享經歷的方式
That sharing experience aspect to it

1490
01:21:54,761 --> 01:21:58,894
正在改變看去影院看電影的習慣
That shifting, going to the movies

1491
01:21:58,952 --> 01:22:02,516
也很大程度上變得虛擬了
Well it's also becoming much larger virtually

1492
01:22:02,517 --> 01:22:05,813
可視世界已經大大像虛擬化延伸了
Mural space was definitely spanned virtually

1493
01:22:05,814 --> 01:22:10,782
大家在虛擬世界裡分享電影
So they're watching movies together in this sort of virtual worlds

1494
01:22:10,790 --> 01:22:13,267
幾乎是不可避免的
And that will be inevitable

1495
01:22:15,000 --> 01:22:17,786
費洛蒙也要虛擬交換嗎？
You had to get the Pheromone to exchange virtually

1496
01:22:17,787 --> 01:22:24,706
啊？ 怎麼流血怎麼流汗，不接觸怎麼爽啊
Yeah? how do you bleed and sweat and be comfortable without getting together

1497
01:22:24,707 --> 01:22:26,563
你在影院做那些嗎？穿著拉風風衣？
You do that in the theater? In your trench coat

1498
01:22:26,564 --> 01:22:30,278
倒沒有，不過可以一起笑一起哭啊
No but laughing together and crying together

1499
01:22:30,279 --> 01:22:35,062
有時候虛擬的經驗反而更加奏效
Some way the virtual experience is more rewarding because

1500
01:22:35,063 --> 01:22:37,198
因為總有實際的溝通在進行
There is a actual dialog going on

1501
01:22:38,637 --> 01:22:40,820
這些20多歲的小伙子不在乎
So these 20-year-old does not care

1502
01:22:40,821 --> 01:22:45,185
不過在網路社交空間倒有很多影院
But there are lots of cinemas in the communal space

1503
01:22:45,186 --> 01:22:49,504
他們只談論在臉書還是什麼上又交了什麼好友
There they just sit in and tell a story getting friends on Facebook or whatever it is

1504
01:22:49,505 --> 01:22:52,291
你得適應，你要適應不了也沒事
You got to go with it, if you can't be able to deal with it

1505
01:22:52,292 --> 01:22:55,542
因為你的時代已經過去了
that's fine, because it means your time is finished

1506
01:22:55,543 --> 01:22:58,003
大家看開點吧
it's time for all the people to take it on

1507
01:22:58,747 --> 01:23:01,022
30歲以下的年輕人
the kids, 30 and under

1508
01:23:01,023 --> 01:23:07,059
在電腦電視上看了無數的數位影像
have seen endless digital image on their computer, on their television

1509
01:23:07,379 --> 01:23:11,048
對於他們來說，那就是他們的電影
and that to them is their film

1510
01:23:11,309 --> 01:23:14,978
我曾經希望這些小型攝影機
I just had hoped that these little cameras

1511
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:20,365
可以促成民間電影的一場革命
will make a revolution where you would say the folk films good

1512
01:23:20,366 --> 01:23:22,337
不過自己製作的話
Just do it ourselves

1513
01:23:22,338 --> 01:23:27,213
許多才華和人才都因為免費而得不到足夠尊重
so a lot of talent and stuff could be free by less respect

1514
01:23:27,214 --> 01:23:29,117
全民都在解讀電影
Everyone is interpreting

1515
01:23:29,387 --> 01:23:34,077
他們透過鏡頭和畫面解讀事實或者自以為的事實
Their reality or what they did their reality through an image, through a lens

1516
01:23:34,078 --> 01:23:39,000
不過有些孩子真的還挺擅長這個的
And some kids are really good at it, I'll tell you

1517
01:23:39,001 --> 01:23:42,001
{\a6}微型傢俱，2010
設備：佳能 7D

1518
01:23:42,500 --> 01:23:46,455
我熱愛DV文化，否則我也不會拍這部電影
I love digital video culture, or I won't never making with this

1519
01:23:46,456 --> 01:23:49,600
因為我是作家出身，而我認為
Because I came out as a writer and I thought that as

1520
01:23:49,601 --> 01:23:51,426
電影製作人應該是有專業知識
you have certain kind of knowledg

1521
01:23:51,427 --> 01:23:53,191
然後可以自由操控
and basically my head keeps a thought like a dude

1522
01:23:53,192 --> 01:23:55,746
拍攝機器的那麼一個人
who operational machine to do this job

1523
01:23:55,747 --> 01:23:58,903
我覺得真踏上那條路我會害怕的
I think I would be scared to step into that road

1524
01:23:58,904 --> 01:24:04,476
巨大的攝影機和15人的燈光團隊
If it had to involve getting a huge camera and get a 15 lightening technicians together

1525
01:24:04,477 --> 01:24:11,565
我覺得用這樣小而且私人的方式體驗電影製作就可以了
I was able to experience making movies small private way which I need to do

1526
01:24:11,566 --> 01:24:14,352
佳能5D和其他單眼相機如何呢
What about the 5Ds, what about the DLSRs

1527
01:24:14,353 --> 01:24:18,021
這些相機是給記者設計的
These cameras are designed to the request of APM writers

1528
01:24:18,030 --> 01:24:25,102
攝影師可以拍攝新聞影片給網站
So there news photographers could shoot news video for their websites

1529
01:24:25,733 --> 01:24:27,173
僅此而已
That's it

1530
01:24:27,815 --> 01:24:29,766
人們會覺得
then people came along went:

1531
01:24:29,767 --> 01:24:32,784
“哇，還不錯，我也要用”
“woo, I like the look of that, I'm gonna use that”

1532
01:24:33,300 --> 01:24:34,693
然後效果也不錯
And it can work

1533
01:24:34,695 --> 01:24:37,157
不過拍電影可不行 --  為什麼？
but I hate it being used as movie cameras -- Why?

1534
01:24:37,158 --> 01:24:39,197
不夠好
It's not good enough

1535
01:24:39,658 --> 01:24:42,538
但是它們便宜，人人都能拍電影
But they ain't expensive, people can make movies

1536
01:24:42,540 --> 01:24:46,206
如果我是藝校的學生，有台Canon 7D或5D
If I've been in art school and I have a Canon 7D or 5D

1537
01:24:46,207 --> 01:24:48,203
那肯定很棒
It would be wonderful

1538
01:24:50,000 --> 01:24:52,136
你今晚用什麼拍？
What are you shooting on tonight?

1539
01:24:52,137 --> 01:24:54,783
7D。天，7D耶
-7D. Oh my God, that's 7D

1540
01:24:54,784 --> 01:24:56,826
是為了研二的作業
For my second year of grad film

1541
01:25:01,674 --> 01:25:08,152
我猜是因為易用，拍的不賴，而且不貴
I guess it's accessible, give you a lot that you can capture, but it's not super expensive

1542
01:25:08,153 --> 01:25:11,153
{\a6}舒提 甘古利，紐約大學研究生

1543
01:25:08,153 --> 01:25:13,586
我用7D或5D拍攝主要是預算原因
I want to shoot with the 7D or 5D primarily for budget reasons

1544
01:25:13,746 --> 01:25:19,623
還因為只有一周時間可用了
And because we are given a week in which we have to shoot our film

1545
01:25:19,624 --> 01:25:24,917
大部分時間都花在了選題、約場地
And in amount of time we were lose in terms like changing film checking the gate

1546
01:25:24,918 --> 01:25:30,546
所以時間不夠用也是原因
And then I would probably not be able to film the soon I want to

1547
01:25:30,550 --> 01:25:36,781
想要講自己的故事變得比較便宜
It becomes the very cheap way for us to tell our stories about ourselves

1548
01:25:37,912 --> 01:25:41,846
它已經跳脫了與環境抗爭的藝術載體
It takes this art format out of where fighting environment

1549
01:25:41,847 --> 01:25:44,168
很多人都加入了藝術創作的行列
and a lot more people to make art

1550
01:25:45,580 --> 01:25:51,153
人人都有紙和筆
Everybody and his little brother has a piece of paper and pencil

1551
01:25:51,521 --> 01:25:54,600
但偉大的故事又...
But how many great stories had been written

1552
01:25:55,000 --> 01:25:56,630
在這紙上寫出多少呢
on that piece of paper

1553
01:25:57,310 --> 01:26:01,211
現在同樣的事要發生在電影身上了
Now the same thing is gonna happen in cinema

1554
01:26:01,212 --> 01:26:07,563
幾個電影人聚在一起
There used to be in conference when film making guys

1555
01:26:08,018 --> 01:26:10,201
坐在咖啡店閒談
people sat in coffee shop and saying

1556
01:26:10,202 --> 01:26:13,544
說如果有機會，自己會製作多麼偉大的電影
What great film they would make if the man would ever give me a chance

1557
01:26:13,545 --> 01:26:18,223
現在好了，人人有機會，放手去做就行
It was kind of great when the day came that it was we go do it

1558
01:26:19,149 --> 01:26:23,329
現在每個人都能做電影，電影遍地開花，這不錯
Everybody can make a movie now, movies are everywhere, that's a good thing

1559
01:26:23,787 --> 01:26:26,945
我不這麼認為，其實好處少
I don't think so actually, there's less good

1560
01:26:26,946 --> 01:26:28,152
壞處多
There's more bad

1561
01:26:28,153 --> 01:26:31,125
因為每個人都想做什麼做什麼
because everybody is able to do whatever they want to do

1562
01:26:31,126 --> 01:26:34,375
真是民主，真是不錯
That's democratization out there, that's fantastic

1563
01:26:34,376 --> 01:26:36,090
但是我們的下一代會吃苦頭的
But I think my kids will suffer

1564
01:26:36,091 --> 01:26:38,662
他們再不會享受到我們成長時期所擁有的品質了
they will not have the qualities we have been growing up

1565
01:26:38,663 --> 01:26:40,756
因為不會再有人…
Cause there isn't somebody there…

1566
01:26:40,780 --> 01:26:43,073
不會再有人在乎品味了
There isn't a taste make involved

1567
01:26:43,266 --> 01:26:44,189
天啊！
Wow!

1568
01:26:48,236 --> 01:26:51,180
膠卷已經完了嗎？您怎麼看
Is this the end of film? What do you think?

1569
01:26:51,181 --> 01:26:56,247
我覺得，賽璐珞仍然會是個選項
I think celluloid is still gonna be a choice

1570
01:26:56,248 --> 01:26:57,248
{\a6}大藝術家，2011，膠卷攝製

1571
01:26:57,249 --> 01:26:58,249
{\a6}魔球，2011，膠卷攝製

1572
01:26:58,250 --> 01:27:01,249
{\a6}不可能的任務：鬼影行動，2011，膠卷攝製

1573
01:27:01,250 --> 01:27:04,249
{\a6}生命樹，2011，膠卷攝製

1574
01:27:04,250 --> 01:27:07,249
{\a6}戰馬，2011，膠卷攝製

1575
01:27:08,000 --> 01:27:09,990
{\a6}饑餓遊戲，2012，膠卷攝製

1576
01:27:10,000 --> 01:27:13,000
{\a6}黑暗騎士：黎明昇起，2012，膠卷攝製

1577
01:27:13,612 --> 01:27:17,420
轉變只因為有一個新的選擇
a transition starts with people offering a new choice

1578
01:27:17,421 --> 01:27:20,578
不過是否意味著舊的選擇即將被取代
But if it finished it will take the old choice away

1579
01:27:20,579 --> 01:27:23,968
我不認為現在的技術已經準備好了
I don't think techniques are ready to do that yet

1580
01:27:23,969 --> 01:27:28,008
我們有100多年純粹用膠卷拍攝的歷史
we have hundred years of experience basically shooting on film

1581
01:27:28,851 --> 01:27:31,126
而現在膠卷也還在使用
And film it still around

1582
01:27:31,560 --> 01:27:34,432
不管喬治盧卡斯說什麼“膠卷已死”
No matter what George Lucas said that “film is dead”

1583
01:27:34,433 --> 01:27:36,700
他其實20年前就這麼說了
he said that 20 years ago

1584
01:27:36,934 --> 01:27:41,021
但是膠卷沒有死，人們還是喜歡用膠卷
But film is not dead because people like to shooting on film

1585
01:27:41,022 --> 01:27:45,015
因為膠卷真的可以呈現難以置信的美
because it really has an incredibly beautiful look

1586
01:27:45,016 --> 01:27:46,393
誰在乎啊
Who cares

1587
01:27:46,394 --> 01:27:49,783
20年內他們就不會再說膠卷怎樣怎樣
In 20 years from now they wouldn't be saying what looks like film

1588
01:27:49,784 --> 01:27:51,965
轉而說“看看我的數位攝影機能做什麼吧”
they would be saying “look what I can do with my digital”

1589
01:27:51,966 --> 01:27:54,380
我會是最後還在使用膠卷攝影的人
I will be the one last guy shooting film

1590
01:27:54,381 --> 01:27:57,167
因為沒其他人使用它了
Cause no one else would be left shooting film

1591
01:27:57,168 --> 01:28:01,950
而且我確定在10年間我也會開始使用數位技術
But I certain will be use digital technology within the next 10 years

1592
01:28:01,951 --> 01:28:05,005
我希望，要是5到10年內膠卷還存在的話
I hope, if in another 5 or 10 years film still exists

1593
01:28:05,006 --> 01:28:07,327
我還是打算繼續用膠卷拍
I still plan to shoot on film

1594
01:28:07,328 --> 01:28:09,637
膠卷時代是不是結束了？
Is it the end of film?

1595
01:28:11,228 --> 01:28:13,271
對，我猜它是完了
Yeah, I guess it is

1596
01:28:13,272 --> 01:28:16,522
而且我認為5年之內，膠卷就...
And I think in 5 years, film will be

1597
01:28:16,908 --> 01:28:20,066
膠卷就幾乎不會存在了
film will be exception, I really do

1598
01:28:22,010 --> 01:28:25,493
膠卷設備銷售在2007年達到了頂峰
Film production peaked in 2007

1599
01:28:25,494 --> 01:28:28,494
{\a6}比爾 羅素，ARRI攝影部副總裁

1600
01:28:25,494 --> 01:28:31,158
我們在那時膠卷攝影機已經生產過剩10%了
Our factory at that time was working 110% to produce film cameras

1601
01:28:31,159 --> 01:28:32,134
然後呢？
Then what happened?

1602
01:28:32,743 --> 01:28:34,508
然後世界變了
Then the world changed

1603
01:28:35,592 --> 01:28:38,286
所有的訂單都變成數位的了
New purchases are all digital

1604
01:28:39,568 --> 01:28:42,261
膠卷攝影機可以延續數十年
Film cameras can last for decades

1605
01:28:42,262 --> 01:28:45,233
仍能使用也仍被使用
They will be still available and in use

1606
01:28:45,234 --> 01:28:48,662
然而，主流廠商
However, our major manufactures

1607
01:28:48,663 --> 01:28:51,356
已經停止新膠卷攝影機的發展
have seized the development of new film cameras

1608
01:28:50,386 --> 01:28:53,386
{\a6} “結束了，ARRI、Panavision的膠卷攝影機”

1609
01:28:53,387 --> 01:28:56,387
{\a6}“電影攝影機公司已靜靜停止生產膠卷攝影機”

1610
01:28:51,848 --> 01:28:53,984
他們不再生產膠卷攝影機了
They no longer make them

1611
01:28:55,098 --> 01:28:57,095
我們不得不和賽璐珞說再見了
We will have to say goodbye to celluloid

1612
01:28:57,096 --> 01:28:59,170
膠卷會消失
it will go away I'm afraid

1613
01:28:58,288 --> 01:29:01,288
{\a6}“膠卷像影機，1888-2011”

1614
01:28:59,171 --> 01:29:00,897
因為某些特殊用途它們還是會存在
And they will be cared for special occasions

1615
01:29:01,020 --> 01:29:03,495
但是其他的都要變了
I think, but it's gonna change

1616
01:29:03,496 --> 01:29:06,051
一旦這個選擇消失了
once that option is gone

1617
01:29:06,052 --> 01:29:07,119
嗯
Right

1618
01:29:07,120 --> 01:29:10,183
一旦現在的年輕人不再有膠卷電影的體驗
Once young people don't have the experience

1619
01:29:10,184 --> 01:29:14,316
我覺得我們正在經歷這場全面變革
I think we are living through this total transformation

1620
01:29:14,317 --> 01:29:18,078
我覺得大概人們都會擔心這會是沒完沒了的爭論
I think in general people will fear it's just endless noise

1621
01:29:18,079 --> 01:29:20,678
沒人說得清什麼是好的，什麼是不好的
no one was able to tell what's good or bad

1622
01:29:20,679 --> 01:29:23,279
沒人能真正做出好東西
No one will be able to make good things

1623
01:29:23,280 --> 01:29:25,090
所有好的都會消失
And good things will just get lost

1624
01:29:25,100 --> 01:29:28,527
我覺得我們的文化繼承岌岌可危
That in danger I think, the continuation of our culture

1625
01:29:28,600 --> 01:29:30,988
一切歸於塵土
What will back to me need to back to the wild

1626
01:29:31,000 --> 01:29:31,563
嗯
Right

1627
01:29:31,564 --> 01:29:36,067
你從哪裡獲得文化、藝術和知識的養份呢？
Where did you get the nourishment of culturally, artistically, intellectually

1628
01:29:36,068 --> 01:29:37,128
哪裡呢？
Where did you get it

1629
01:29:37,711 --> 01:29:42,123
電影製作的關鍵一步是存檔
And an important step of movie making process is archival

1630
01:29:42,548 --> 01:29:47,471
把成片和其他資料儲存起來
Storing the final complete movie and materials used to create it

1631
01:29:48,114 --> 01:29:51,039
沒人把存檔當回事
Nobody takes archival seriously

1632
01:29:51,040 --> 01:29:53,222
人們都把東西存在硬碟裡
They're all save it on hard drive

1633
01:29:53,223 --> 01:29:56,008
放了一年再拿出來
And if the hard drive on the shelf and a year later

1634
01:29:56,009 --> 01:29:58,645
放的時候可能就出現“噠噠噠”的聲音
You load it, it just got “ter…ter…”

1635
01:29:58,648 --> 01:30:00,413
因為卡住了
Because they stick

1636
01:30:01,232 --> 01:30:03,647
它不會總是這樣
You don't find them all time they stick

1637
01:30:03,648 --> 01:30:05,644
不過要是你發現了
If You do find out all the time

1638
01:30:05,645 --> 01:30:09,359
那就是壞了，然後噠噠響
they wear out and go “ter…ter…”

1639
01:30:09,647 --> 01:30:13,966
1950年代起，在電視廣告開始興盛的時期
Since the early 1950s, since the advance of the commercial television

1640
01:30:14,616 --> 01:30:17,616
{\a6}邁克爾 五井，攝影師，美國攝影師協會主席

1641
01:30:13,967 --> 01:30:17,402
有80多種影片格式
There had been 80 formats of video

1642
01:30:17,600 --> 01:30:20,000
現在這80多種影片格式
Today, these 80 formats of video

1643
01:30:21,950 --> 01:30:24,620
的大多數已經完全不能播放了
most cannot be played anymore

1644
01:30:24,621 --> 01:30:27,105
就因為播放器已經不存在了
Cause the machine simply don't exist

1645
01:30:27,421 --> 01:30:32,205
拍電影的時候我們會把樣片做2個數位備份
When we make a movie we have 2 digital copies of all of the dailys

1646
01:30:32,206 --> 01:30:34,680
你把這些拷貝裝箱的時候
When you box those how to be stored

1647
01:30:34,681 --> 01:30:38,534
最好放個播放器在旁邊
Yet put a reader in with that thing

1648
01:30:38,751 --> 01:30:45,996
我有8種80年代做的音樂短片和廣告存檔格式
I have archival 8 formats for music video and commercials I did n 1980s

1649
01:30:46,786 --> 01:30:50,404
已經沒機器能播了
And there's no machine that can play them

1650
01:30:50,405 --> 01:30:53,650
在數位世界你完全找不到
There are no archives or formats or anything

1651
01:30:53,651 --> 01:30:56,455
任何實體存檔格式
in the digital world that you will put any stock in

1652
01:30:56,456 --> 01:30:59,334
所以數位格式的存檔問題含待解決
so their archive issues are simply not being dealt with yet

1653
01:30:59,335 --> 01:31:01,702
對於電影
The only thing you can sure of the on film

1654
01:31:01,703 --> 01:31:03,931
或其他的動態影像來說
or anything of the moving image

1655
01:31:03,932 --> 01:31:06,393
你能保證儲存個六七十年的
is gonna be around may by for 60 or 70 years from now

1656
01:31:06,394 --> 01:31:08,390
很有趣也很諷刺
Interestingly enough, ironically enough

1657
01:31:08,391 --> 01:31:09,551
只有賽璐珞
The celluloid

1658
01:31:15,498 --> 01:31:18,498
{\a6}蓋瑞 因豪斯，柯達首席技術官

1659
01:31:15,498 --> 01:31:16,288
膠卷是特別的
Film is unique

1660
01:31:16,289 --> 01:31:19,028
因為膠卷同時是捕捉和儲存介質
Because film is a capture medium and an storage medium

1661
01:31:20,347 --> 01:31:22,322
所以你要回看的話
So if you really want to go back

1662
01:31:22,323 --> 01:31:24,510
只要保存得當
and if you can restore it in the right conditions

1663
01:31:25,271 --> 01:31:27,686
100年後只要有光
A hundred years later all you have to do is shining light through it

1664
01:31:27,687 --> 01:31:28,800
也還是可以看
And you are able to see it

1665
01:31:28,800 --> 01:31:31,540
不會有格式淘汰的問題
There were never be format obsolete

1666
01:31:31,564 --> 01:31:34,564
{\a6}愛德 斯塔拉德曼，動態影像助理館長
喬治 伊斯特曼博物館（世界最古老的攝影博物館和影片藏館）

1667
01:31:31,564 --> 01:31:33,653
1909年
There was a conference in 1909

1668
01:31:33,654 --> 01:31:37,322
膠卷的規格和標準被整理確定
Where they put together the standard for film

1669
01:31:38,268 --> 01:31:40,683
102年未變
While it hasn't changed for 102 years

1670
01:31:41,752 --> 01:31:43,841
我用氮氣保存的膠卷
I have a film in my nitrogen forms

1671
01:31:43,842 --> 01:31:46,628
現在仍能在放映機上放映
I can pull it out and run it on the projector today

1672
01:31:46,629 --> 01:31:49,315
儘管我知道這是1895年拍攝完成的
even know it was made in 1895

1673
01:31:50,549 --> 01:31:53,661
如果換個觀點，想想存檔
If the point, alternately the archiving is

1674
01:31:53,662 --> 01:31:57,469
可以是原始作品的完全複製
the faithful reproduction of the original product

1675
01:31:59,009 --> 01:32:02,771
那電影人現在有更好的機會
Film makers now have a better chance

1676
01:32:02,772 --> 01:32:06,500
讓自己的作品可以
of something I may being showed properly 50 years from now

1677
01:32:06,501 --> 01:32:09,091
在50年後仍完美展現
that I ever have in history

1678
01:32:09,092 --> 01:32:12,853
可人們總說“我們可不知道50年後會發生什麼
people keep saying “we don't know what's going to happen in 50 years,

1679
01:32:12,854 --> 01:32:15,128
“也許就沒法播放了
“we don't know how to read the information or

1680
01:32:15,129 --> 01:32:19,096
“也許就毀損了，你必須轉換它要不就沒有了”
“it's going to decay, you have to migrated or it will die”

1681
01:32:19,097 --> 01:32:21,789
對，沒錯，得轉換，不過還有一件事
yeah, sure, you will, and some of the those things are true

1682
01:32:21,790 --> 01:32:24,251
這樣的解決方案總比膠卷好
all of them are better scenario than film

1683
01:32:28,276 --> 01:32:30,737
幾乎這世界上的所有東西
all of everything in this whole world

1684
01:32:30,900 --> 01:32:32,455
都在用數位儲存
is stored digitally

1685
01:32:33,240 --> 01:32:34,081
是啊
yeah

1686
01:32:34,082 --> 01:32:37,424
對啊，問題就在這裡
Yeah, there are problems with it

1687
01:32:38,075 --> 01:32:39,839
但是問題是可以被解決的
But they are gonna solve those problems

1688
01:32:39,840 --> 01:32:40,954
這點我保證
I'll guarantee that

1689
01:32:41,648 --> 01:32:43,459
這麼多的數位資訊
There's too much digital information out there

1690
01:32:43,460 --> 01:32:46,484
不可能沒有更全面的儲存解決辦法
not to figure out a full proof way to storage forever

1691
01:32:46,749 --> 01:32:50,557
歷史總是在進步
Archeology always improves

1692
01:32:50,558 --> 01:32:54,040
某些我們無法控制的變化
So as the way we lose things change

1693
01:32:54,041 --> 01:32:57,306
也許正是我們找到解決方案的契機
The way that we invent to find them changes

1694
01:32:57,307 --> 01:32:59,303
所以您並不擔心這些消失的東西囉
So you are not worried about all these disappearing

1695
01:33:00,308 --> 01:33:02,445
如果某件事對人類真的是重要的
Is things are important for human beings

1696
01:33:02,446 --> 01:33:04,070
那就肯定會有保存的辦法
we figure out a way to preserve them

1697
01:33:04,071 --> 01:33:05,556
這總是沒錯的
It's always been truth

1698
01:33:06,000 --> 01:33:09,065
這是我們生活的一部分
Yes we do that part of life

1699
01:33:09,300 --> 01:33:14,304
有一天我們也許會在舞臺上展示電影膠卷
We might get to the stage where a print of a film

1700
01:33:14,306 --> 01:33:18,902
因為稀有而使它更像一件藝術品
Is so rare is almost like an art object

1701
01:33:19,148 --> 01:33:20,959
而我們可以說：
And we can go back and say

1702
01:33:20,960 --> 01:33:25,232
“這是一份電影膠卷，全世界唯一一份”
“this is actually a print of film and it's the only one of the world.”

1703
01:33:28,000 --> 01:33:31,761
一兩百年後這些都不會剩下任何痕跡
100, 200 years from now there won't be a trace of this left

1704
01:33:32,333 --> 01:33:36,048
我們現在所製造的東西也都消失無蹤
And there won't be trace of anything we make now

1705
01:33:39,375 --> 01:33:41,279
所以你身在何方？ 能把你怎樣
So where are we? what fucked you?

1706
01:33:47,486 --> 01:33:49,994
我從不相信
I don't believe in one second that

1707
01:33:49,995 --> 01:33:52,919
數位影片或數位技術
digital imaging or digital technology

1708
01:33:52,920 --> 01:33:56,580
會改變人類說故事的方式
will ever take the way the humanity of story-telling

1709
01:33:56,810 --> 01:33:59,810
{\a6} 2001太空漫遊，1968

1710
01:33:56,581 --> 01:33:58,585
因為這關於我們的本質
beause story-telling in it on ourselves

1711
01:33:58,586 --> 01:34:01,650
這是神聖的人類事物
it's a holy human concern

1712
01:34:02,880 --> 01:34:06,400
藝術家忠於本質，科學家自然也是
artist primordial, science also quite primordial

1713
01:34:06,401 --> 01:34:10,450
這其實很和諧
so kind of all these things are very harmony things

1714
01:34:10,451 --> 01:34:12,586
他們總是在互相推進
They always had to push on one another

1715
01:34:13,480 --> 01:34:15,942
我們已經達到化學攝影技術的頂端
We are at the top of photo chemical process

1716
01:34:15,943 --> 01:34:17,660
也就能走這麼遠了
This is about far as we're ever gonna go

1717
01:34:17,661 --> 01:34:20,400
但是用數位技術的話，我們就重新回歸到初始了
When you are using digital, you are at the very bottom again

1718
01:34:20,890 --> 01:34:24,512
所以要跳出傳統幫助創新
So you should jump over and help to build that

1719
01:34:24,860 --> 01:34:27,182
因為越多人使用才能使這項技術更進一步
Cause more people use it, the better it gets

1720
01:34:28,643 --> 01:34:31,522
除非你參與到這場變革中
Unless you are participate into the revolution

1721
01:34:32,000 --> 01:34:33,904
否則就會被淘汰
Or you will be lost in past

1722
01:34:34,599 --> 01:34:37,478
我們不能說“沒我的事
We can't call ourselves as “we don't care

1723
01:34:38,000 --> 01:34:39,486
看你們了”
They are up to your guys now”

1724
01:34:40,704 --> 01:34:42,887
我們要參與其中
So we have to be in it

1725
01:34:42,888 --> 01:34:47,985
每個人都能參與到這個過程中
Everyone will have access to both the means of the production

1726
01:34:47,986 --> 01:34:51,468
也能立刻了解到曾經發生的事
and watch everything ever exist instantly

1727
01:34:51,469 --> 01:34:55,742
隨著數位技術持續改變我們說故事的本質
As digital continues to change the nature of story-telling

1728
01:34:55,743 --> 01:34:57,274
我們也在改變
We also continue to change

1729
01:34:57,275 --> 01:34:59,875
甚至這種改變我自己都不能理解
In ways that I could not even understand

1730
01:35:00,154 --> 01:35:04,565
不過所有的都在改變，這就成了一場巨大的變革
But all things do that and it becomes a giant revolution

1731
01:35:05,502 --> 01:35:10,425
人們喜歡好故事，好故事能帶他們去從未體驗過的世界
People love great stories, they let them getting into the world they haven't experienced

1732
01:35:10,800 --> 01:35:16,044
至於是怎麼樣的過程，我覺得並不重要
And how they get there, it doesn't really matter

1733
01:35:16,736 --> 01:35:20,083
我們開始使用數位技術到如今的程度，並不意味著停滯不前了
One shouldn't even think we stop when now we reach digital this is it

1734
01:35:21,122 --> 01:35:24,883
完全不是，想想看娛樂形式如何表現
No, no, think about where the entertainment imports

1735
01:35:24,884 --> 01:35:27,809
大眾需求又何去何從
Where the need is going to go

1736
01:35:27,810 --> 01:35:31,896
你認為你在技術上處於哪個層級？
Do you feel technologically with where you are

1737
01:35:31,897 --> 01:35:33,103
是否得心應手？
Dou you feel free

1738
01:35:33,104 --> 01:35:35,843
我不認為我想要去感覺
I'm not sure that I ever want to feel

1739
01:35:35,844 --> 01:35:39,373
我們已經到達了一定程度，從技術上講
that we arrived, technologically

1740
01:35:39,374 --> 01:35:41,978
我覺得我們總能做得更好
I always feel that there is something we can do better

1741
01:35:42,000 --> 01:35:46,483
我們的前輩給了世界一個夢想的新時代
The people who coming to us gave the world new ace to dream

1742
01:35:46,780 --> 01:35:49,380
我認為我們要繼續他們的使命
I think it's our job to continue that

1743
01:35:49,381 --> 01:35:52,306
繼續給人們創造夢想
and to try to give people new ace to dream

1744
01:35:52,637 --> 01:35:56,027
所有最後都會回歸到一件事
Everything comes down to one thing

1745
01:35:56,028 --> 01:35:58,860
如果你用心去做
If you do something with your heart

1746
01:35:58,860 --> 01:36:02,907
如果能夠讓我們產生共鳴
if you do something convince us to feel about it

1747
01:36:03,424 --> 01:36:06,443
那你拿什麼做到的並不重要
It doesn't matter what you using
