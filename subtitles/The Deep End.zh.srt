1
00:00:08,894 --> 00:00:09,962
好吧
All right.

2
00:00:09,963 --> 00:00:11,384
我是个雄心勃勃的人吗
Okay. Am I ambitious?

3
00:00:11,385 --> 00:00:12,360
这问题算浪费了
That's a waste of a question.

4
00:00:12,361 --> 00:00:14,022
我们都雄心勃勃
We're all ambitious.

5
00:00:14,023 --> 00:00:15,799
-说的对  -对极了
- True.  - True that.

6
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:16,789
我很自信吗
Am I confident?

7
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:18,068
你那是自大
You're stuck-up.

8
00:00:18,069 --> 00:00:19,559
我才不自大呢
I'm not stuck-up!

9
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:20,709
那我一定是贝希了
I guess that makes me Beth.

10
00:00:20,710 --> 00:00:22,719
我才不自大
I am not stuck-up!

11
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:23,586
你把游戏彻底搞砸了
Oh, you totally blew it.

12
00:00:23,587 --> 00:00:25,319
拜托  我被人身攻击了
Well, I was being attacked.

13
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,209
我有权为自己辩解
I have the right to defend myself if I'm being attacked.

14
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:28,029
别争了
Please.

15
00:00:28,030 --> 00:00:30,070
好了  再来再来
Okay, okay, okay.

16
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:31,729
我很感性吗
Am I sensitive?

17
00:00:31,730 --> 00:00:33,470
-绝对的  -我是迪兰
- Yes. - I'm Dylan.

18
00:00:35,540 --> 00:00:37,599
我还有其它特点  你们还没发现
There are sides of me that you haven't seen.

19
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:38,959
是吗  比如呢  还可以更感性吗
Really? Like what? Softer ones?

20
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:40,559
把衬衫掀起来  里面有小狗吗
Lift up your shirt. You made puppies?

21
00:00:41,951 --> 00:00:43,759
好了  大家安静
Wait, you guys, you guys.

22
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,199
是文字处理器的消息  服务器仍没有修好
That's word processing. The server's still down.

23
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,120
咱们的文件今晚没法搞定了
Our documents are not gonna be done for tonight.

24
00:00:49,707 --> 00:00:51,590
-游戏结束  -等等  你们不能走
- Fun's over. - Wait. wait, you can't go.

25
00:00:51,591 --> 00:00:53,309
还没猜过我呢  再来一次  
We haven't done me yet. Please do me. 

26
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:54,869
猜猜我  拜托
One more. Do me. Please.

27
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:56,030
-好吧  速战速决  -好
- Alright. Quick speaks.  - OK.

28
00:00:56,690 --> 00:00:58,639
我强壮吗
Am I strong?

29
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,199
你是黑人  大家晚安
You're black. Good night, everybody.

30
00:01:04,531 --> 00:01:07,910
听着  刚刚我说你感性...
Hey. What I said earlier about your being "sensitive"...

31
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:09,459
你知道我是在开玩笑吧
You know I was only kidding, right?

32
00:01:09,460 --> 00:01:10,691
了解  别放在心上
Oh, yeah. Don't sweat it, man.

33
00:01:10,692 --> 00:01:12,650
你知道我其实是怎么看你的  对吧
You know what I really think about you, don't you?

34
00:01:13,002 --> 00:01:14,550
"英雄"
"Hero."

35
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:17,945
伙计  真感人
Dude, that's very touching.

36
00:01:17,946 --> 00:01:19,744
我是认真的  伙计
I mean it, mate.

37
00:01:19,745 --> 00:01:21,620
"小女生"
"Girl."

38
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:26,759
斯特林先生  您也加班啊
Mr. Sterling, you're here late.

39
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:29,250
我在看一个案子  你可能会感兴趣
Yes, I was just reviewing a case that might interest you.

40
00:01:29,770 --> 00:01:32,100
-明天忙吗  -对  因为要跟您一起干了
- Are you busy tomorrow? - Yes, sir. Working with you.

41
00:01:33,440 --> 00:01:36,420
没错  "英雄"
Yeah. "Hero."

42
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:45,289
你肯定很喜欢修道院
You got to love that priory.

43
00:01:45,290 --> 00:01:46,790
是的  先生
Yes, sir.

44
00:01:47,950 --> 00:01:49,825
他死定了
He's a dead man.

45
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:58,109
一年半前  我认识了克里斯托夫
I met Christopher a year a a half ago.

46
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:00,540
他可爱  帅气  又风趣
He was sweet and handsome and funny.

47
00:02:00,610 --> 00:02:03,719
跟他一起总是笑声不断
I never spent so much time laughing.

48
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:07,249
他被派去阿富汗后我们开始筹划婚礼  但...
We were planning their wedding when he was sent to Afgnistan, but...

49
00:02:07,250 --> 00:02:10,000
六个月前  克里斯托夫在喀布尔城外遇害了
Christopher was killed outside Kabul about six months ago.

50
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:11,290
我很遗憾
I'm sorry.

51
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:13,019
那么  在那之后多久
And how soon after that

52
00:02:13,020 --> 00:02:14,849
政府便开始过问你的签证情况了
did the government get in touch with you about your visa status?

53
00:02:14,850 --> 00:02:16,519
他们从没问过
They didn't.

54
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:17,526
我失去南加州混凝土公司的工作后
I contacted them 

55
00:02:17,527 --> 00:02:19,850
曾联系过他们
after I lost my job at SoCal Concrete.

56
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:23,159
他们说我的代行婚礼是无效的
And they told me my proxy marriage was invalid.

57
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:24,929
"代行婚礼"
"Proxy marriage"?

58
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:27,334
当新郎被派遣到海外工作时
Yeah, it's when the groom is deployed overseas,

59
00:02:27,335 --> 00:02:30,251
双方可在不同地方签署文件  确定婚姻关系
the couple will get married by signing documents on separate continents.

60
00:02:30,252 --> 00:02:32,238
这在军队里是很常见的
Fairly common practice in the military.

61
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:33,923
看来你对此知之甚多
You seem to know a lot about it.

62
00:02:33,924 --> 00:02:37,399
我当过兵  第二海军陆战队第一营
I was in the corps. Second Marines, First Battalion.

63
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,149
那么是代理婚礼签的文件有问题吗
So was there a defect in the proxy-marriage paperwork?

64
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:43,319
不  是因为克里斯托夫在战争中牺牲了
No, it's because Christopher was killed in combat

65
00:02:43,320 --> 00:02:46,009
没能活着回来圆房
before he could return home and consummate the marriage.

66
00:02:46,010 --> 00:02:47,263
但你已经怀孕了
But you're pregnant.

67
00:02:47,264 --> 00:02:52,299
我告诉移民局我们结婚之前我就怀孕了
I told immigration the truth. It happened before we were married.

68
00:02:52,300 --> 00:02:56,539
他们说没有工作签证我就得回中国
They told me that since I lost my work visa, I had to go back to China.

69
00:02:56,540 --> 00:02:59,569
但我的家庭  我的生活都在这里
But my family is here. My life is here.

70
00:02:59,570 --> 00:03:02,989
我想在这里养育孩子  这里是我的家
I want to have my baby here. This is my home.

71
00:03:02,990 --> 00:03:05,240
斯特林公司很荣幸能帮助你们
Sterling would be honored to help you.

72
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:07,869
对吧  赫威特先生
Isn't that right, Mr. Hewitt?

73
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:09,940
我们一直在努力做正确的事
We always try to do the right thing.

74
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:14,560
性骚扰的案子  而我们要为骚扰者辩护
A sexual-harassment case, and we're representing the harasser?

75
00:03:14,561 --> 00:03:18,469
原告所谓的"骚扰者"  名叫罗宾·雷诺兹
Alleged harasser. The client's name is Robin Reynolds.

76
00:03:18,470 --> 00:03:20,888
是美国女士内衣公司的总裁
He is the CEO of American Lingerie.

77
00:03:20,889 --> 00:03:24,754
原告是公司的中层经理  叫拉兹亚·卡恩
The accuser is a mid-level executive, a woman named Rhazia Kahn,

78
00:03:24,755 --> 00:03:27,599
她声称雷诺兹常常语带暗示  并且举止猥亵
who claims that Reynolds created a hostile work environment

79
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,259
使工作环境充满了敌意
with his suggestive comments and lewd behavior.

80
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:31,819
她的说法可信吗
Has her case got any merit?

81
00:03:31,820 --> 00:03:33,559
这是我们要去调查的
Well, that's we hope to find out.

82
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,920
今天下午你俩去见见他
'Cause the two of you are gonna meet him later this afternoon.

83
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:39,500
我还以为史波克先生[星际奇航3主角]找我们呢
I guess Mr. Spock needs us on the bridge.

84
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:42,850
我是说你那扇自动门
Because of your automatic door.

85
00:03:42,920 --> 00:03:46,210
"嗖"的一声就开了  就像在进取号星舰上
Because it's "whoosh," you know, Starship Enterprise.

86
00:03:46,670 --> 00:03:48,180
算了  当我没说
Never mind.

87
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:53,579
我只想说
I just thought I'd say

88
00:03:53,580 --> 00:03:55,659
我知道以前我有时显得很笨拙
I-I know there's been some awkward moments in the past,

89
00:03:55,660 --> 00:03:58,709
但我真的...真的很期待与您共事
but I'm...I'm really looking forward to working on this with you.

90
00:03:58,710 --> 00:04:00,760
谢谢你这么突兀的拍我马屁
Thank you for the obligatory ass-kissing.

91
00:04:01,580 --> 00:04:05,130
赶快离开  倒计时5  4  3  2
Hasty departure in 5, 4, 3, 2...

92
00:04:05,170 --> 00:04:06,275
如果我说"我想咬掉你的带子"  
How would you respond if I said, 

93
00:04:06,276 --> 00:04:08,579
你会有什么反应
"I wanted to snap your whizz strap"?

94
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:10,969
我想这取决于说话人的语气
I guess it would depend on inflection.

95
00:04:10,970 --> 00:04:14,019
原告声称咱们的客户对她说过这话
That's one of the things the plaintiff alleges our client said to her.

96
00:04:14,020 --> 00:04:15,640
我想"咬掉"你的带子
I want to snap your whizz strap.

97
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:17,889
我想咬掉你的"带子"
I want to snap your whizz strap.

98
00:04:17,890 --> 00:04:19,689
我想咬掉"你的"带子
I want to snap your whizz strap.

99
00:04:19,690 --> 00:04:23,580
看吧  我一直觉得你俩之间有暧昧
See? I always thought there was something going on between you two.

100
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,899
我去拿我的东西  一号会议室见
I'm gonna go get my stuff. See you in conference room one.

101
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:30,959
听着  卡瓦诺的案子结了
Hey. Listen, the Cavanaugh case settled,

102
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:33,742
也就是说  我今晚彻底空出来了
which means I have an absolutely free night tonight

103
00:04:33,743 --> 00:04:35,489
这么久以来的第一次啊
in the first time in forever.

104
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:37,789
我们刚接到这个性骚扰的案子
Well, we just got assigned this sexual-harassment case,

105
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:39,709
但明天之前都不会有进一步发现
but we don't have discovery until tomorrow,

106
00:04:39,710 --> 00:04:42,259
所以  共进晚餐加看电影怎么样
so, dinner and a movie?

107
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:44,654
或者省略前面的步骤
Or we skip all that and go straight to the part where 

108
00:04:44,655 --> 00:04:46,450
让我直接咬掉你的带子
I snap your whizz strap.

109
00:04:48,809 --> 00:04:50,020
真的吗
Really?

110
00:04:50,170 --> 00:04:51,688
对啊  直接入正题  
Yeah, cut to the chase, 

111
00:04:51,689 --> 00:04:52,866
燃烧点卡路里  
burn some calories, 

112
00:04:52,867 --> 00:04:55,369
扯落几粒纽扣
burst a few buttons.

113
00:04:55,370 --> 00:04:56,175
我又想了想  
On second thought, 

114
00:04:56,176 --> 00:04:59,160
我还是该专心做克里夫的案子好了
I should probably focus on this Cliff thing.

115
00:05:01,350 --> 00:05:04,219
呃  是因为我提到了你的带子吗
Uh...Is this 'cause I mentioned the whizz strap,

116
00:05:04,220 --> 00:05:05,595
其实我都不知道那是什么意思
because I don't even know what that means.

117
00:05:05,596 --> 00:05:08,436
律海扬帆
第一季第三集

118
00:05:13,390 --> 00:05:16,949
知道吗  苏珊  我一直觉得你是逃跑律师
You know, Susan, I always considered you the lawyer who got away.

119
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:18,849
这话从你嘴里说出来算是天大的恭维了
Coming from you, that's a huge compliment.

120
00:05:20,946 --> 00:05:23,370
菲尔要退休了  听说了吗
Did you hear the Phil is retiring?

121
00:05:23,490 --> 00:05:25,900
真可惜  菲尔是你的杀手锏
Ouch. Phil was your closer.

122
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:28,589
他是我交手过的最强悍的律师
Was the toughest lawyer I ever went up against.

123
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:30,519
你需要找个新的角斗士了
You're gonna need a new gladiator.

124
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:33,010
事实上  我希望你能接手他的宝剑
Actually, I was hoping you'd take up his sword.

125
00:05:33,730 --> 00:05:35,459
这是个天大的机会
Could be a huge opportunity.

126
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:38,309
在斯特林公司你有20人的诉讼团队
Instead of controlling a litigation team of 20 at Sterling,

127
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:40,329
在我们这儿你能领导100人
you'd be top dog on a team of 100.

128
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:41,759
斯特林公司是我的家
Sterling is my home.

129
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:44,250
你应该得到一个摆脱克里夫掌控的机会
You deserve the chance to step out of Cliff's shadow.

130
00:05:45,920 --> 00:05:46,969
汤姆...
Tom...

131
00:05:46,970 --> 00:05:48,739
考虑一下吧
Okay, just consider it.

132
00:05:48,740 --> 00:05:52,350
你很出色  又无情  而且像鲜花一样好闻
You're brilliant, relentless, and you smell like flowers.

133
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:55,880
作为律师  这些是再好不过的资本了
As lawyers go, it doesn't get any better than that.

134
00:05:56,610 --> 00:05:58,170
您还需要什么吗
Can I get you anything else?

135
00:05:58,240 --> 00:05:59,579
不用了  谢谢
No, thank you.

136
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:01,970
我正在享受他美味的恭维
I'm just savoring my delicious compliment.

137
00:06:02,650 --> 00:06:03,446
紧急情况
Emergency?

138
00:06:03,447 --> 00:06:05,229
什么样的紧急情况  我能做什么
What kind of emergency? What can I do?

139
00:06:05,230 --> 00:06:07,019
通常我不会拿这些事麻烦你
Normally, I wouldn't bother you with all this,

140
00:06:07,020 --> 00:06:08,336
但我现在被困在范奈司法院
except for I'm stuck at the Van Nuys Courthouse

141
00:06:08,337 --> 00:06:09,816
法官正在审核我的动议
while the judge reviews my motion.

142
00:06:09,817 --> 00:06:10,909
马尔科姆  别担心
Malcolm, don't worry about it.

143
00:06:10,910 --> 00:06:12,809
我和贝希正在等文件  你需要什么
Beth and I are waiting on documents. What do you need?

144
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:14,540
我需要你去接我弟弟
I need you to pick up my brother.

145
00:06:14,630 --> 00:06:15,899
什么弟弟
What brother?

146
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:17,239
他叫艾瑞克  11岁
His name's Eric. He's 11.

147
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:18,959
你从没提过有个弟弟
You've never mentioned a brother.

148
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:20,670
因为我不想说这些
It's because I don't like talking about it.

149
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:22,350
你可以信任我
You can trust me.

150
00:06:23,370 --> 00:06:24,749
我知道
I know.

151
00:06:24,750 --> 00:06:28,280
所以我给你打电话  表示我信任你
That's why I calle. This is me trusting you.

152
00:06:28,860 --> 00:06:30,199
所以  你能帮忙吗
So, can you help me?

153
00:06:30,200 --> 00:06:32,010
当然  我要去哪儿接他
Of course. Where am I going?

154
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:40,369
很明显克里斯托夫·布伦戴奇出事前
Christopher Brundage was clearly planning

155
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:42,679
已经准备与梅共度一生
on a life with Mei before he was killed in action.

156
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,670
这些信件能够证明他的意愿
There are letters that indicate his intent,

157
00:06:44,671 --> 00:06:48,420
我们还有证人能证实他确有此意
and we have witnesses that will corroborate statements he made to that effect.

158
00:06:48,420 --> 00:06:52,289
此外  美国海军陆战队也已经承认了这段婚姻
Further, the United States Marine Corps already recognizes this marriage.

159
00:06:52,290 --> 00:06:53,779
斯特林先生  这也许是事实
Well, that may be true, Mr. Sterling,

160
00:06:53,780 --> 00:06:56,000
但移民和海关执法局有不同的标准
but Immigration and Customs Enforcement has a different standard.

161
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:58,369
是否圆房
And consummation of the marriage

162
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:00,669
是代行婚礼是否能被承认的关键
is pivotal to their recognition of any proxy wedding.

163
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:02,059
她已经怀了他的孩子
She's pregnant with his child.

164
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:03,839
他们早已圆房了
The relationship has been consummated.

165
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:06,753
很抱歉  但法律认定婚前性行为是私通
Well, I'm sorry, but the law sees premarital sex as fornication,

166
00:07:06,754 --> 00:07:08,000
而不是圆房
not marriage consummation.

167
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,819
法官大人  这位女士的丈夫为国捐了躯
Your honor, this woman's husband sacrificed his life in service to our country.

168
00:07:12,820 --> 00:07:15,799
现在她和孩子只因破坏了某些陈腐的法律
Now she and her baby are being forced to leave the land he died for

169
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:18,299
就要被迫离开丈夫誓死保卫的国家吗
because some obsolete rule is being broken?

170
00:07:18,300 --> 00:07:19,790
怎么能这样
How does that make sense?

171
00:07:19,790 --> 00:07:21,610
我知道这有些不合理
I understand the equities,

172
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:25,559
但我只能遵照法律办事
but I have no choice but to apply the law as written.

173
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:28,020
恐怕你的委托人必须回中国去了
I'm afraid your client is gonna have to go back to China.

174
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:45,109
蔡司校长  我是艾迪·费舍尔
Principal Chase, I'm Addy Fisher.

175
00:07:45,110 --> 00:07:46,569
是马尔科姆·班尼特的同事
I'm a colleague of Malcolm Bennet's.

176
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:48,089
你应该收到了他的传真
You should have a fax from him

177
00:07:48,090 --> 00:07:49,730
准许我来接他弟弟艾瑞克
granting me permission to pick up his brother, Eric.

178
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:56,059
你是艾瑞克吗
You Eric?

179
00:07:56,060 --> 00:07:57,029
你是谁
Who are you?

180
00:07:57,030 --> 00:07:58,740
我是艾迪·费舍尔
I'm Addy Fisher.

181
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:00,379
怎么回事  你没事吧
What's going on? Are you okay?

182
00:08:00,380 --> 00:08:03,040
恐怕不好  他因携带武器到学校而被停课了
No, he's suspended for bringing a weapon to school.

183
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:06,019
你带了武器到学校
You brought a weapon to school?

184
00:08:06,020 --> 00:08:07,000
我没有
No!

185
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:09,778
他说他没有
He says he didn't do it.

186
00:08:09,779 --> 00:08:12,000
你是谁  他的律师吗
What are you, his lawyer?

187
00:08:12,001 --> 00:08:15,040
事实上  算是吧
Actually...sort of.

188
00:08:18,510 --> 00:08:20,829
这个圆房的要求明显不公平
The consummation requirement is patently unfair.

189
00:08:20,830 --> 00:08:23,460
我同意  但我们是律师  不是立法者
I agree, but we are not lawmakers. We're lawyers.

190
00:08:23,490 --> 00:08:25,209
想想有多少家庭因此受害
Think about how many other families it's affecting.

191
00:08:25,210 --> 00:08:26,739
我们工作不就是为他们主持公道吗
Isn't it our job to get justice for them?

192
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:29,662
我们的工作是集中精力帮我们的客户 梅
Our job is to concentrate on our client -- Mei.

193
00:08:29,663 --> 00:08:31,554
我在国会还有几个朋友
I still have a few friends in congress.

194
00:08:31,555 --> 00:08:33,569
我看看他们中是否有人
I'm gonna see if one of them might sponsor

195
00:08:33,570 --> 00:08:35,419
能提出私人法案来承认他们的婚姻
a private bill recognizing her marriage.

196
00:08:35,420 --> 00:08:36,949
那样需要很多时间
That'll take forever.

197
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:38,430
要是在此期间梅被遣送回中国
And if Mei is sent back to china in the interim,

198
00:08:38,431 --> 00:08:40,047
不管有没有私人法案
the Chinese government will never allow her to return

199
00:08:40,048 --> 00:08:40,904
中国政府都不会再让她回来了  
Bill or no bill.  

200
00:08:40,905 --> 00:08:41,903
也许你是对的
You're probably right.

201
00:08:41,904 --> 00:08:43,000
所以你得拖延梅被驱逐出境的时间
Which is why you need to find a way to

202
00:08:43,001 --> 00:08:45,000
直到国会通过法案
stall that deportation till congress can act.

203
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,648
知道吗  当我雇用拉兹亚时
You know, when I hired Rhazia,

204
00:08:59,649 --> 00:09:00,999
我以为她在这里会如鱼得水
I thought she was gonna be a great fit here.

205
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,000
你觉得这些蕾丝怎么样
What do you think of this lace, huh?

206
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:05,299
画龙点睛之笔啊  是吧
It's, like, overwhelming, isn't it?

207
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:07,189
不  你说得对
No, you're right.

208
00:09:07,190 --> 00:09:08,749
你说得对  没有更好
You're right. Less is more.

209
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:11,940
对了  就是这样  很好  你太美了
That's it. That's it. great. You're good.

210
00:09:12,440 --> 00:09:17,099
总之  你是说卡恩女士在这里很适应
Anyway, you were saying that Ms. Kahn was a good fit.

211
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:18,199
开始是的  直到有一天 
Initially, yeah. Then suddenly she was offended by 

212
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:19,299
她说别人穿内衣是冒犯了她
people wearing underwear.

213
00:09:19,300 --> 00:09:22,469
这可是家内衣公司啊  靠
This is a lingerie company, for god's sake, so...

214
00:09:22,470 --> 00:09:23,794
所以你否认她的指控
So you deny her claim that 

215
00:09:23,795 --> 00:09:25,229
说你造成了敌对性工作环境了
you created a hostile work environment?

216
00:09:25,230 --> 00:09:26,599
我恰恰为自己感到很自豪
I happen to pride myself

217
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:28,859
在我创造的工作环境里  人人都很开心
on creating an environment where everybody is happy.

218
00:09:28,860 --> 00:09:30,000
那些括设计内衣的人
The people designing the lingerie,

219
00:09:30,001 --> 00:09:31,200
穿着内衣的人
the people wearing the lingerie,

220
00:09:31,201 --> 00:09:32,000
还有那些陶醉其中的人
and the people drinking it in.

221
00:09:32,001 --> 00:09:35,539
无法言表  吉娜  你让这套内衣更美了
What can I say? Gina, honey, you make that look great.

222
00:09:35,540 --> 00:09:37,990
我真想脱下它
I totally want to unwrap the package.

223
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,799
雷诺兹先生  对不起
Mr. Reynolds, I'm -- I'm sorry,

224
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:41,419
但就是这样的话语
but that's precisely the kind of comment

225
00:09:41,420 --> 00:09:43,089
会被误会为有敌意
that could be construed as hostile.

226
00:09:43,090 --> 00:09:46,289
这是一个充满创意的工作场所
Okay, this is a creative workplace.

227
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:47,759
我们卖的就是性
What we're selling is sex.

228
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:50,009
所以我的员工要觉得可以畅所欲言
So people need to feel free to express their opinions.

229
00:09:50,010 --> 00:09:51,286
如果拉兹亚不能适应 
If Rhaa couldn't handle that, 

230
00:09:51,287 --> 00:09:52,679
那她就不该接受这份工组
she shouldn't have taken the job.

231
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:55,259
在上诉之前  她向你正式投诉过吗
Did she ever make a formal complaint before the lawsuit?

232
00:09:55,260 --> 00:09:57,939
她一直是个怨妇
Uh, well, she was always kind of a whiner.

233
00:09:57,940 --> 00:09:59,002
顺便说一句  你真美
You're gorgeous, by the way.

234
00:09:59,003 --> 00:10:00,810
我可以想象你穿这件内衣的样子
 I can totally see you in this.

235
00:10:01,620 --> 00:10:04,310
你穿什么型号的  想试试吗
What size are you? You want to try it on?

236
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:06,940
不用了
I'm good.

237
00:10:10,310 --> 00:10:11,860
怎么了
Hey, what's up?

238
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:15,680
不如你告诉我吧
Why don't you tell me?

239
00:10:16,270 --> 00:10:18,000
你听说我跟汤姆·林奇吃早餐的事了
U heard about my breakfast with tom lynch.

240
00:10:18,001 --> 00:10:19,014
苏珊  在洛杉矶 
Can't throw a rock in L.A.

241
00:10:19,015 --> 00:10:20,938
扔块石头都能砸中三个律师
without hitting a lawyer, Susan.

242
00:10:20,939 --> 00:10:22,162
如果你和林奇西蒙事务所的
If you have a meeting with 

243
00:10:22,163 --> 00:10:23,461
资深合伙人会谈
the senior partner of Lynch&Simon,

244
00:10:23,462 --> 00:10:24,610
我肯定会知道的
I'm gonna find out about it.

245
00:10:24,611 --> 00:10:27,000
那不是会谈  只是朋友一起吃个早餐
It wasn't a meeting. it was a friendly breakfast.

246
00:10:27,001 --> 00:10:29,159
至少在他向我提供工作之前我是这么想的
At least that's what I thought until he offered me a job 

247
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:31,950
我从未要求过那份工作
one I did not solicit.

248
00:10:31,951 --> 00:10:32,976
你拒绝他了吗
Did you turn him down?

249
00:10:32,977 --> 00:10:34,243
我没有
I haven't...

250
00:10:34,244 --> 00:10:35,885
目前还没有
Yet.

251
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:38,239
哈特  你知道我怎么看你的
Hart, you know how I feel about you,

252
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:42,000
但现在  这里的事情对我来说太纠结了
but things are really complicated around here for me right now.

253
00:10:42,001 --> 00:10:43,836
-克里夫  -还能有什么
- Cliff.  - What else?

254
00:10:43,890 --> 00:10:44,836
你俩现在怎么样了
How's that going?

255
00:10:44,837 --> 00:10:47,630
自从他搬到里茨之后   好多了
Better since he moved into the Ritz.

256
00:10:48,530 --> 00:10:51,249
这种谈话最好边喝点马蒂尼边进行
Well, this is a conversation better had over martinis.

257
00:10:51,250 --> 00:10:52,900
-共进晚餐  -我很乐意
- Dinner?  - I'd love to.

258
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:54,790
我去安排
I'll set it up.

259
00:10:58,940 --> 00:11:00,189
喂  是我
Hey. It's me.

260
00:11:00,190 --> 00:11:01,589
只是...确定下
Just...checking in.

261
00:11:01,590 --> 00:11:05,709
还是希望今晚能见到你  晚点也行
Um, still hoping to see you tonight, even if it's late.

262
00:11:05,710 --> 00:11:08,459
你听到留言后  请打电话给我
So, uh, give me a call when you get this...

263
00:11:08,460 --> 00:11:10,799
晚点再说
And I'll talk to you a bit later.

264
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:11,919
再见  妈妈
Bye...Mum.

265
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:14,709
是我妈打来的
That was Mum.

266
00:11:14,710 --> 00:11:16,529
才不是
No, it wasn't.

267
00:11:16,530 --> 00:11:19,270
对  是个女人
No. That was a woman.

268
00:11:20,670 --> 00:11:23,420
那进展如何
So, um, how's that going for you?

269
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:26,929
纠结  困惑还有点挫败感
Complicated, confusing, frustrating.

270
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:28,459
听起来像是描述约会的词
Those sound like dating adjectives.

271
00:11:28,460 --> 00:11:29,959
你是不是在和某人约会啊
Are you actually dating someone?

272
00:11:29,960 --> 00:11:31,879
我正在尝试
Uh, I'm trying to yeah,

273
00:11:31,880 --> 00:11:34,600
但每当我暗示两人在一起时  她总会生气
But every time I suggest a get-together, she gets upset.

274
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:36,529
这个"在一起"
These "get-togethers" --

275
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:37,829
你说的时候是穿着裤子还是没穿
You pitching pants-on or pants-off?

276
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:38,889
-没穿  -好吧
- Pants off.  - Okay.

277
00:11:38,890 --> 00:11:40,299
我不知道澳大利亚的人们会怎么做
I can't speak for Australia,

278
00:11:40,300 --> 00:11:42,759
但在这里  在这个赤道北边的国家
but up here -- you know, above the equator --

279
00:11:42,760 --> 00:11:45,359
真正的男女关系是需要一些技巧的
Real relationships typically tend to revolve

280
00:11:45,360 --> 00:11:47,209
而不总是赤裸相见
around a certain strategic lack of nudity.

281
00:11:47,210 --> 00:11:49,719
是很令人失望  但不可避免
Yes, it's disappointing but unavoidable.

282
00:11:49,720 --> 00:11:51,630
你真的想开始一段感情吗
You want to be in a relationship?

283
00:11:51,640 --> 00:11:53,430
是的
Yes.

284
00:12:01,520 --> 00:12:03,000
那你得设法取悦她
Then you're gonna have to court her.

285
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:06,000
我想现在有点为时已晚了
Oh, I think it's a little late for that.

286
00:12:06,001 --> 00:12:07,500
-我们已经...  -我知道
- We've already..  - Oh, I'm sure you have.

287
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:09,969
但如果你想维持下去
But if you want to sustain that,

288
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:11,899
想有进一步发展
if you want to move past that,

289
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:13,559
那你就要多听听她的倾诉
then you're gonna have to listen to her.

290
00:12:13,560 --> 00:12:15,029
要热切关注
You're gonna have to care about the things

291
00:12:15,030 --> 00:12:17,490
她所关注的东西
that she cares about - intensely.

292
00:12:17,660 --> 00:12:20,010
你要引她上钩
You're gonna have to draw her in.

293
00:12:20,500 --> 00:12:23,459
我觉得这可能有点过时了
Yeah, I think that's probably a little old-fashioned,

294
00:12:23,460 --> 00:12:24,493
你不觉得吗
Don't you think?

295
00:12:24,494 --> 00:12:28,049
如果你说的过时  是指成熟谨慎
Yeah, if by "old-fashioned", you mean mature and evolved

296
00:12:28,370 --> 00:12:31,390
并且比你现在的方法都行之有效  那么是的
and vastly superior to your current strategy.

297
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:34,939
真感人
Ttouché.

298
00:12:34,940 --> 00:12:36,490
谢谢
Merci.

299
00:12:38,280 --> 00:12:39,910
兄弟  很抱歉我当时不在
Hey, Kiddo, sorry I wasn't there.

300
00:12:40,223 --> 00:12:41,180
没关系
It's okay.

301
00:12:41,181 --> 00:12:42,644
真不敢相信  你被停课了
I can't believe you got suspended.

302
00:12:42,645 --> 00:12:44,859
你带什么武器去学校了
What is this about you bringing a weapon to school?

303
00:12:44,860 --> 00:12:46,969
是我当童子军时用的一套刀叉勺
It was my cub scout knife, fork, and spoon set.

304
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:50,209
我还没被停课  艾迪和校长谈过了
And I'm not suspended yet. Addy talked to the principal.

305
00:12:50,210 --> 00:12:52,569
艾迪跟校长谈了你被停课的事
Addy spoke to the principal about your suspension?

306
00:12:52,570 --> 00:12:54,479
-不只是跟她谈  -什么意思
- Not just spoke to her.  - What do you mean?

307
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:57,179
她扔出名片  跟校长说她是我的律师
She threw down her card, said she was my lawyer.

308
00:12:57,180 --> 00:12:59,000
就像上次我被艾里克斯打了之后
It was like that time I got beat up by Alex Carey

309
00:12:59,001 --> 00:12:59,999
妈妈到他们家  
and mom went over to his house. 

310
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:02,110
听着 我一会就回来  好吗
Listen, I'm gonna be right back, okay?

311
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,000
我和国会议员科尔什谈过了
I spoke with congressman korsh,

312
00:13:07,001 --> 00:13:08,500
他很乐意提出这项私人法案
and he's happy to sponsor the private bill.

313
00:13:08,551 --> 00:13:11,629
但他估计通过需要六个月的时间
But he estimates that it could take up to six months

314
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:14,010
好详细打点好一切
to get the I's dotted and the t's crossed.

315
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:15,814
我可能有办法为我们争取点时间了
I think I may have figured out a way to buy us some time.

316
00:13:15,815 --> 00:13:16,811
说吧
I'm listening.

317
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:19,780
我们争辩的是梅的孩子的公民权益
We argue for the citizenship rights of Mei's baby.

318
00:13:20,850 --> 00:13:22,550
一位还未出生的美国公民吗
An as-yet-unborn American citizen?

319
00:13:22,551 --> 00:13:23,500
他的父亲是美国公民
His father is a citizen.

320
00:13:23,501 --> 00:13:26,719
我会以此为争论说那孩子有美国公民权
I'd argue that the baby has presumptive civil rights

321
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:27,999
如果他的妈妈被驱逐出境
which will be violated   

322
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:29,719
那他的公民权就被侵犯了
if his mother is removed from U.S. soil.

323
00:13:29,720 --> 00:13:31,189
这有点夸张了
Well, that's a stretch.

324
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:32,269
也许吧  但我们现在只能如此了
Maybe. But it's all we got right now.

325
00:13:32,270 --> 00:13:33,659
那就去找让我们的当事人准备一下
Well, then, go prep our clients.

326
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:37,000
有观点可以争辩总比没有好
An elastic argument is better than no argument at all.

327
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:44,662
艾迪  我能和你谈谈吗
Addy, can I talk to you for a moment?

328
00:13:44,663 --> 00:13:46,007
好的  晚点再说
Yeah. I'll talk to you later.

329
00:13:46,008 --> 00:13:47,999
你看到艾瑞克没  他在你办公室
Hey. Did you find Eric? He's in your office.

330
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,049
看见了  他告诉我你跟校长谈过了
Yes, he told me you spoke to the principal.

331
00:13:50,050 --> 00:13:52,000
是的  童子军餐具武器  这真荒谬
Yeah. This cub scout-set thing is pretty ridiculous.

332
00:13:52,001 --> 00:13:53,001
他们想说那些东西是武器
They're trying to say it was a weapon.

333
00:13:53,002 --> 00:13:54,879
对  但我并没要求你那样做
Oh. Yeah, I didn't ask you to do that, though.

334
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:55,759
这没什么  我只是
It was nothing. I just --

335
00:13:55,760 --> 00:13:57,000
我真的很感激你去接艾瑞克
I really appreciate you picking up Eric,

336
00:13:57,001 --> 00:13:59,000
-但是他是我的责任  -是  我知道
- But he's my responsibility.  - Yeah, I know that.

337
00:13:59,001 --> 00:14:00,111
而且我完全可以
And I'm completely capable of

338
00:14:00,112 --> 00:14:01,519
自己搞定那个校长
handling the principal on my own.

339
00:14:01,520 --> 00:14:02,887
我从没觉得你不能
I never said that you weren't.

340
00:14:02,888 --> 00:14:04,647
我只是叫她在下发停课令之前
All I did was ask her to meet with you

341
00:14:04,648 --> 00:14:06,519
见你一面  和你谈谈
before she handed out a suspension.

342
00:14:06,520 --> 00:14:07,979
知道吗  我只想帮点忙
You know what? I was trying to be helpful.

343
00:14:07,980 --> 00:14:09,800
下次我不会再多管闲事了
Next time, I won't bother.

344
00:14:21,610 --> 00:14:24,547
赫威特先生
Mr. Hewitt... 

345
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,000
他们还没同意我打电话给你
They haven't let me use a phone that to call you.

346
00:14:28,001 --> 00:14:29,000
你怎么知道的
How did you know?

347
00:14:29,001 --> 00:14:29,834
我知道什么
How did I know what?

348
00:14:29,835 --> 00:14:33,239
移民局明天有趟飞往南京的航班
Immigration has a plane leaving for Nanjing tomorrow.

349
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:35,460
他们说我要坐那班飞机走
They told me that I would have to be on it.

350
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:41,639
对不起  请让让
Excuse me, sorry.

351
00:14:41,640 --> 00:14:43,109
-埃尔南德斯法官  -什么事
- Judge Hernandez...  - Yes?

352
00:14:43,110 --> 00:14:44,330
-埃尔德南斯法官  -什么事
- Judge hernandez...  - Yes?

353
00:14:44,460 --> 00:14:45,591
布伦戴奇夫人未出世的孩子
Mei brundage's unborn child 

354
00:14:45,592 --> 00:14:46,909
是美国公民  法官大人  
is a U.S. citizen, your honor.

355
00:14:46,910 --> 00:14:48,459
-他不能被驱逐  -没有法院认可
- He can't be deported.  - No court has ever recognized

356
00:14:48,460 --> 00:14:50,679
胎儿也可以获得美国公民身份
a fetus' standing for citizenship.

357
00:14:50,680 --> 00:14:52,249
没错  但梅已经怀孕八个月了
True, but Mei is eight months pregnant.

358
00:14:52,250 --> 00:14:54,579
孩子已经完全成型了  而且根据刑法
The baby is totally viable, and, under criminal law,

359
00:14:54,580 --> 00:14:56,370
他已经可以被看作是单独的个体了
he would already be considered an individual.

360
00:14:56,780 --> 00:14:58,619
但愿不会  但如果梅被谋杀了 
If, god forbid, Mei were murdered,

361
00:14:58,620 --> 00:14:59,849
凶手将要为她和她孩子的死亡
her assailant would be tried

362
00:14:59,850 --> 00:15:01,359
负上双重责任
for the death of both her and the baby.

363
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:02,449
这话在我听来
Sounds to me like

364
00:15:02,450 --> 00:15:03,889
就像你想在把刑事标准
you're trying to bootstrap the criminal standard

365
00:15:03,890 --> 00:15:05,179
引入到移民案件中来
into an immigration case.

366
00:15:05,180 --> 00:15:08,049
法官大人  中国是极权国家
Your honor, China is a totalitarian state.

367
00:15:08,050 --> 00:15:10,279
把孩子去驱逐到那里  完全是通过不正当程序
To deport a baby there is a complete deprivation

368
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,859
剥夺了他的自由
Of freedom without due process.

369
00:15:11,860 --> 00:15:13,569
这是违反了第八修正案的
That -- that's a violation of the eighth amendment.

370
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:15,689
我不觉得这会影响上诉
I doubt this is going to hold up on appeal,

371
00:15:15,690 --> 00:15:18,839
但我会授予你临时禁制令
but I will grant you a temporary restraining order

372
00:15:18,840 --> 00:15:20,769
以确保你的当事人在分娩前能留在这里
to keep your client here until she delivers her child.

373
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:23,269
24小时之内她就要被驱逐了
She's gonna be deported in less than 24 hours.

374
00:15:23,270 --> 00:15:25,990
律师先生  我在用最快的速度写禁令了
Counselor, I'm writing as fast as I can.

375
00:15:27,550 --> 00:15:28,909
我们绝对可以辩论说
We can definitely argue

376
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:31,619
美国内衣公司是个有创造性的工作场所
that American lingerie is a creative workplace.

377
00:15:31,620 --> 00:15:34,023
对  而且在那里  员工们的行为准则
Right. and in that, their employees should be held

378
00:15:34,024 --> 00:15:35,194
应是各不相同的
to a different standard of behavior.

379
00:15:35,195 --> 00:15:38,394
太棒了  请继续
Fascinating. Please, continue.

380
00:15:38,888 --> 00:15:40,769
好的
Okay.

381
00:15:40,770 --> 00:15:42,289
但他在我们面前说的一些话很有问题
But he said some things in front of us that were questionable, 

382
00:15:42,290 --> 00:15:44,029
即使是在那种场合
even in that context.

383
00:15:44,030 --> 00:15:46,069
-那让你觉得不爽吗  -有点儿
- Did that upset you?  - A little.

384
00:15:46,070 --> 00:15:49,760
那暂停一下  谈谈你的感受吧
Well, let's just take a moment and discuss how you feel.

385
00:15:50,610 --> 00:15:52,109
你犯什么病啊
Okay, what's wrong with you?

386
00:15:52,110 --> 00:15:54,580
没没  我只是感兴趣
Nothing. I'm just interested...

387
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:59,929
对...我的三明治
...in...my sandwich,

388
00:15:59,930 --> 00:16:02,433
红肠三明治  口味一级棒
Which is bologna, but it's really extraordinary.

389
00:16:02,790 --> 00:16:04,489
布莱弗德小姐  费舍尔小姐
Ms. Branford and Ms. Fisher,

390
00:16:04,490 --> 00:16:05,386
有你们的包裹  
These packages arrived for you, 

391
00:16:05,387 --> 00:16:07,180
罗宾·雷诺兹送的
courtesy of Robin Reynolds.

392
00:16:12,450 --> 00:16:14,040
老天
Oh, my god.

393
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,239
太胡来了
Um, how inappropriate.

394
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:18,239
这是什么东西
I mean, what is this?

395
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:20,120
情妇装
Well, that's a mistress costume.

396
00:16:21,020 --> 00:16:25,009
这件  你觉得是要传递个什么信息
Now, what -- what message do you think this is sending?

397
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:27,189
我想咬掉你的带子
"I want to snap your whizz strap."

398
00:16:27,190 --> 00:16:30,339
穿成这样我自己都想咬掉带子
Well, I would want to snap my whizz strap, too, in this.

399
00:16:30,340 --> 00:16:32,439
我想咬掉你的带子  
I want to snap your whizz strap. 

400
00:16:32,440 --> 00:16:34,730
-你有多想咬掉我的带子呢  -我得走了
- Oh, how badly do you want to snap my whizz strap?  - I've got to go.

401
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:37,239
我喜欢
Hmm. I like it.

402
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:39,010
我也是  喜欢
I like this. I like it.

403
00:16:44,220 --> 00:16:45,449
我在找你
Hey, looking for you.

404
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:46,699
讨好行动  根本没用
The courting -- it's not working.

405
00:16:46,700 --> 00:16:48,049
"没用"是什么意思
What do you mean it's not working?

406
00:16:48,050 --> 00:16:49,289
我试着对她的话感兴趣
I tried being interested in her.

407
00:16:49,290 --> 00:16:50,379
试着问问题
I tried asking her questions.

408
00:16:50,380 --> 00:16:51,709
结果却讲到了我的三明治
And then I spoke about my sandwich.

409
00:16:51,710 --> 00:16:53,469
我就像个脑残  也许还很诡异
I seemed impaired -- possibly creepy.

410
00:16:53,470 --> 00:16:55,879
呃  你会孤独终老的
Ugh. You are gonna die alone.

411
00:16:55,880 --> 00:16:56,969
作为导师
You know, for my mentor,

412
00:16:56,970 --> 00:16:59,089
你可真是批评有意  建议无心呀
You're kind of heavy on criticism and light on advice.

413
00:16:59,090 --> 00:17:00,769
好吧  我的良策没有用
Okay, my subtlety's not working.

414
00:17:00,770 --> 00:17:02,499
那你就得这么办了
So here's your action plan.

415
00:17:02,500 --> 00:17:03,689
-快说  -把我下面说的东西买齐
- Yes?  - Obtain the following --

416
00:17:03,690 --> 00:17:05,749
-罗迪欧大道  爱菠菠店的鲜花  -好
- Flowers from Apropos on Rodeo Drive.  - Yes.

417
00:17:05,750 --> 00:17:07,539
-美宜堡巧克力店的巧克力  -行
- Truffles from malibu chocolates.  - Check.

418
00:17:07,540 --> 00:17:09,489
-还有你家乡的土特产  -没问题
- And something distinctive from your country of origin.  - Righty-o.

419
00:17:09,490 --> 00:17:11,779
-都给她吗  -没错
- I give those to her?  - Yep!

420
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:15,830
黎姆  你能行的
Liam... you can do this.

421
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:19,519
在这具惹火猛男的雄躯中跳动着的
Beneath this smoking hunk of horse-thief

422
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:22,159
是诗人般的心  我知道的
Beats the heart of a poet -- I just know it.

423
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,309
真的吗
You really mean that?

424
00:17:23,310 --> 00:17:25,049
绝对纯爷们的角度
In the most un-gay way possible.

425
00:17:25,050 --> 00:17:27,060
我可当真了
I will take that.

426
00:17:31,970 --> 00:17:33,200
你要见我吗
You wanted to see me?

427
00:17:33,370 --> 00:17:34,670
是的
Oh, yeah.

428
00:17:35,130 --> 00:17:37,000
你把这个落在家里了
You left this at the house.

429
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:40,890
我爸的手表
My dad's watch.

430
00:17:45,330 --> 00:17:46,920
Twist-o-flex[手表品牌]
Twist-o-flex.

431
00:17:48,770 --> 00:17:52,279
很贴心
Very thoughtful.

432
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:54,469
我知道你想要它  所以
I knew you'd want it, so...

433
00:17:54,470 --> 00:17:56,440
我想要的是回家
What I want is to come home.

434
00:17:58,310 --> 00:18:00,070
这手表肯定也有同样的感觉
Bet the watch feels the same way.

435
00:18:01,550 --> 00:18:03,080
我还需要些时间
Well, I need more time.

436
00:18:05,970 --> 00:18:07,949
你还要把我仍在冰冷的旷野中
How much longer you gonna leave me

437
00:18:07,950 --> 00:18:10,280
多久才算够
hanging out here in the frozen wilderness?

438
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:13,949
我一直很耐心
I mean, I've been patient.

439
00:18:13,950 --> 00:18:15,210
耐心
Patient?

440
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:17,800
你跟主管助理律师有一腿
You had an affair with our head paralegal.

441
00:18:17,940 --> 00:18:19,129
难道你真的觉得
Do you really think

442
00:18:19,130 --> 00:18:21,280
住在酒店就能还我人情了吗
you're doing me any kind of favor by staying in a hotel?

443
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:25,960
我没有申请离婚  那才叫送你人情
I'm doing you a favor by not filing for a divorce.

444
00:18:26,550 --> 00:18:28,480
谢谢这个纪念品
Well, thanks for the keepsake.

445
00:18:38,610 --> 00:18:40,787
梅  拿到禁止令了
Mei... we got a restraining order.

446
00:18:40,788 --> 00:18:42,420
你明天不会被驱逐出境的
You're not being deported tomorrow.

447
00:18:42,421 --> 00:18:43,326
谢天谢地
Oh, thank goodness.

448
00:18:43,327 --> 00:18:44,903
谢谢  赫威特先生
Thank you, Mr. Hewitt.

449
00:18:44,904 --> 00:18:47,550
她何时能回家
When can she go home?

450
00:18:47,980 --> 00:18:49,069
你还好吧
Are you okay?

451
00:18:49,070 --> 00:18:50,560
我没事
Yes, I'm fine.

452
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:52,599
医生让她尽量不要紧张
The doctor told her to avoid stress.

453
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:54,520
但这一切压力太大了
This is all starting to be too much for her.

454
00:18:57,630 --> 00:19:00,479
我要生了
Baby's coming.

455
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,810
什么
I'm sorry?

456
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:04,590
我要生了
The baby is coming.

457
00:19:04,710 --> 00:19:07,320
快叫救护车
Call an ambulance.

458
00:19:17,390 --> 00:19:19,380
恭喜
Wow. Congratulations.

459
00:19:22,450 --> 00:19:24,220
他叫克里斯托夫
This is Christopher.

460
00:19:24,790 --> 00:19:28,169
出生在美国  小幸运儿
He was born in America. Very lucky.

461
00:19:28,170 --> 00:19:30,480
梅必须被遣返中国吗
Does this mean Mei will have to go back to China?

462
00:19:30,540 --> 00:19:32,710
我会尽力让她留下
I'm gonna do everything I can to keep her here.

463
00:19:33,130 --> 00:19:34,399
不过禁止令
But the restraining order

464
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:36,479
是为了让孩子留在美国才发放的
was issued to keep the baby in the country.

465
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,069
现在既然已经出生  禁令就失效了
And now that he's been born, it's void.

466
00:19:40,070 --> 00:19:41,964
移民局有权遣送梅独自回国  
Immigration can deport Mei without him.  

467
00:19:41,965 --> 00:19:43,030
可她是孩子的母亲
But she's his mother.

468
00:19:43,160 --> 00:19:45,299
政府可不是头一回将非公民的父母
The government separates noncitizen parents

469
00:19:45,300 --> 00:19:47,580
与他们美国公民身份的孩子分开了
from their citizen children all the time.

470
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:48,919
但是别放弃
But don't give up.

471
00:19:48,920 --> 00:19:49,919
我们还没放弃
We haven't.

472
00:19:49,920 --> 00:19:51,115
我已经失去了我的儿子
I already lost my son. 

473
00:19:51,116 --> 00:19:52,430
现在连梅也被要赶走吗
Now they're gonna take Mei?

474
00:19:52,600 --> 00:19:54,320
别哭
No crying, no.

475
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:58,440
妈妈看  十个小手指  十个小脚趾
Mother, look -- 10 fingers, 10 toes.

476
00:19:58,800 --> 00:20:00,760
二十份祝福
20 blessings.

477
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:11,039
班尼特先生  我知道这可能是老生常谈了
Mr. Bennet, I know it may seem frivolous,

478
00:20:11,040 --> 00:20:12,779
但校园暴力案件与日俱增
But school violence is on the rise.

479
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:13,879
我们不能有任何疏漏
We can't be too careful.

480
00:20:13,880 --> 00:20:15,890
所以采取零容忍政策对待武器
So we have a zero-tolerance policy for weapons.

481
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:17,809
我理解  绝对理解
I understand. Absolutely.

482
00:20:17,810 --> 00:20:18,938
但是艾瑞克又不是带了弹簧刀来
But it's not like Eric brought a switchblade to school.

483
00:20:18,939 --> 00:20:21,969
那只是最高奖章得主的奖品
He won a prize for having the most merit badges.

484
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:22,753
他拿给朋友们看看
He was showing his friends.

485
00:20:22,754 --> 00:20:24,398
-恐怕我权利有限  -那就去多要点权利
- I'm afraid my hands are tied.  - Well, untie them.

486
00:20:24,399 --> 00:20:26,235
艾瑞克又不是少年犯
Eric is not a juvenile delinquent or a member

487
00:20:26,236 --> 00:20:27,866
也不是策划校园枪击的什么雨衣黑手党
Of the trench-coat mafia planning a shooting spree.

488
00:20:27,867 --> 00:20:30,119
他只是把童子军的奖品带到了学校
He brought his cub scout prize to school.

489
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:31,734
班尼特先生  我喜欢艾瑞克
Mr. Bennet, I like Eric. 

490
00:20:31,735 --> 00:20:33,189
我知道这很令人受挫
I know it's frustrating.

491
00:20:33,190 --> 00:20:34,859
那为什么还要这样做
Then why are you doing this?

492
00:20:34,860 --> 00:20:37,099
艾瑞克是个好孩子  你知道他经历过什么
Eric is a good kid, and you know what he's been through.

493
00:20:37,100 --> 00:20:39,799
对不起  但是停课太过分了
I'm sorry, but suspension would be terrible for him.

494
00:20:39,800 --> 00:20:41,341
班尼特先生  我理解
Mr. Bennet, I Understand, 

495
00:20:41,342 --> 00:20:43,207
但我们要保证孩子们的安全
but we're trying to keep kids safe.

496
00:20:43,208 --> 00:20:45,450
不能有例外
We're not making any exceptions.

497
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:47,740
祝好
Good day.

498
00:20:55,610 --> 00:20:57,820
我为雷诺兹先生工作了两年
I worked for Mr. Reynolds for two years.

499
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:00,069
起初  骚扰并不严重
At first, it wasn't too bad.

500
00:21:00,070 --> 00:21:01,889
只是时不时的来个双关语
A double entendre here and there.

501
00:21:01,890 --> 00:21:04,939
卡恩小姐  你在内衣设计公司工作
Ms. Kahn, you went to work for a lingerie-design company.

502
00:21:04,940 --> 00:21:06,689
你难道不知道自己投身的是什么事业吗
Didn't you know what you were signing up for?

503
00:21:06,690 --> 00:21:09,169
我知道公司里会有穿着内衣的模特  
I knew there would be models in their underwear, yes.

504
00:21:09,170 --> 00:21:11,709
但是我不能接受污言秽语
But I didn't expect the lewd comments.

505
00:21:11,710 --> 00:21:12,920
而且他骚扰的程度
And the intensity of the harassment

506
00:21:12,921 --> 00:21:14,606
越来越严重
increased the longer I was there.

507
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:16,609
你说的骚扰  是不是指雷诺兹先生
When you say "harassment," are you referring

508
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:18,799
有一些性示意呢
to any kind of sexual overtures from Mr. Reynolds?

509
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,779
没有直接的  但他知道我讨厌暗示性语言
Not directly, but he knew I didn't like the suggestive language.

510
00:21:21,780 --> 00:21:23,669
他有没有过强迫你
Did he ever coerce you into participating

511
00:21:23,670 --> 00:21:25,409
做什么过分的事情呢
in anything that made you feel uncomfortable

512
00:21:25,410 --> 00:21:28,219
比如威胁要炒掉你  或降你职
by threatening to fire or, say, demote you?

513
00:21:28,220 --> 00:21:29,489
没有
Not exactly.

514
00:21:29,490 --> 00:21:30,779
但是他越过了底线
But he crossed the line.

515
00:21:30,780 --> 00:21:32,669
我不知道怎么形容
I don't know how else to describe it.

516
00:21:32,670 --> 00:21:34,940
我是个职业女性
I'm a professional woman.

517
00:21:35,060 --> 00:21:37,000
工作出色
I'm good at my job.

518
00:21:37,080 --> 00:21:39,730
他好像  想破坏这一切
It's like he -- he was trying to undermine that.

519
00:21:41,020 --> 00:21:43,579
他想让我觉得自己很渺小
He tried to make me feel small.

520
00:21:43,580 --> 00:21:45,590
但是你从没被威胁  或者强迫过
But you were never threatened or coerced?

521
00:21:50,730 --> 00:21:52,410
没有
No, I guess not.

522
00:21:55,420 --> 00:21:57,080
大家好
Hello, everyone.

523
00:21:57,400 --> 00:22:00,499
行政法官不愿意签署
The administrative-law judge wasn't willing to issue

524
00:22:00,500 --> 00:22:02,700
让你留下的单方令
an ex-parte order relating to your deportation.

525
00:22:03,050 --> 00:22:04,850
也就是说我必须得走
So I have to go.

526
00:22:10,758 --> 00:22:13,069
那么我需要你帮忙
Then I'd like you to help

527
00:22:13,070 --> 00:22:15,509
-完成收养程序  -收养
- With the adoption.  - Adoption?

528
00:22:15,510 --> 00:22:17,919
中国的条件很艰苦
Life in china will be hard.

529
00:22:17,920 --> 00:22:19,960
我想给克里斯托夫更好的生活
I want better for Christopher.

530
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:24,679
他爸爸为美国战死沙场
My baby's father fought and died for America.

531
00:22:24,680 --> 00:22:27,439
他理应在你们身边长大
He deserves to grow up here with you.

532
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:29,360
你真的想这样吗
Is this really what you want?

533
00:22:29,600 --> 00:22:32,400
我想给孩子最好的生活
I want what's best for my child.

534
00:22:41,510 --> 00:22:43,519
那种咄咄逼人的疯狂语气还真帅啊
Great job in there with that loony tune.

535
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:45,169
卡恩小姐明显感到被侵害了
Ms. Kahn obviously feels victimized,

536
00:22:45,170 --> 00:22:47,189
但是这种性骚扰诉讼
But this type of sexual-harassment claim

537
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:50,512
通常需要强迫或威胁的证据
usuall requires some proof of coercion or retaliation.

538
00:22:50,513 --> 00:22:51,809
她两样都没有
She has neither.

539
00:22:51,810 --> 00:22:54,089
因为完全是莫须有
Well, that's because I didn't sexually harass her.

540
00:22:54,090 --> 00:22:55,749
她来告我
She went the lawsuit route

541
00:22:55,750 --> 00:22:57,349
是因为她工作不成功
Because she couldn't make it in business.

542
00:22:57,350 --> 00:22:59,489
很快  她就会回家
Before you know it, she's gonna be just another washout

543
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:01,009
当主妇抱孩子
on the mommy track, squeezing out kids

544
00:23:01,010 --> 00:23:03,369
唠叨生活有多糟糕了  
and bitching about her soppy life, you know?

545
00:23:03,370 --> 00:23:05,379
还想把不如意都算到我头上
And blaming me for all her failures.

546
00:23:05,380 --> 00:23:07,039
典型的
It's typical.

547
00:23:07,040 --> 00:23:08,489
可不像您二位
Not like you ladies.

548
00:23:08,490 --> 00:23:11,590
您二位聪明  又性感
You ladies are smart... and sexy.

549
00:23:12,070 --> 00:23:13,189
雷诺兹先生
Mr. Reynolds...

550
00:23:14,940 --> 00:23:17,509
-怎么样  -刚做完证词
- How we doing?  - We just finished the deposition,

551
00:23:17,510 --> 00:23:20,590
你的新手女士们刚刚扼杀了我那位前雇员
And your first-years just throttled my former employee.

552
00:23:20,910 --> 00:23:22,710
这就是她们的价值所在
That's what we pay them for.

553
00:23:23,160 --> 00:23:24,810
再次感谢  亲爱的女士们
Thank you again, my lovely ladies.

554
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:28,530
送我出去吧
Walk me out.

555
00:23:28,700 --> 00:23:30,810
荣幸之至
It'd be a pleasure.

556
00:23:33,550 --> 00:23:35,760
现在有没有觉得超级肮脏
Do you feel super dirty right now?

557
00:23:35,780 --> 00:23:37,088
世界上所有的消毒剂
There's not enough hand sanitizer in the world

558
00:23:37,089 --> 00:23:39,720
也消不干净我身上的毒
to make me feel clean.

559
00:23:43,520 --> 00:23:45,029
抱歉  打扰一下
Excuse me. Excuse me.

560
00:23:45,030 --> 00:23:46,279
-费尔顿医生吗  -我是
- Dr. Felden?  - Yes.

561
00:23:46,280 --> 00:23:47,252
我是迪兰·赫威特  
Hi, I'm Dylan Hewitt, 

562
00:23:47,253 --> 00:23:48,710
梅·布伦戴奇的律师
Mei Brundage's attorney.

563
00:23:48,950 --> 00:23:50,680
她被剥夺了公民权
She's waived privilege.

564
00:23:51,070 --> 00:23:53,399
我正在设法寻找
I'm looking for absolutely anything I can use

565
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,849
任何能让她留下的理由
To keep her in the country.

566
00:23:54,850 --> 00:23:56,610
梅的情况真让人心碎  
Ah, Mei's situation is heartbreaking. 

567
00:23:56,611 --> 00:23:57,559
我能帮上什么忙吗
How can I help?

568
00:23:57,560 --> 00:23:59,409
有没有什么医学理由
Are there any medical reasons

569
00:23:59,410 --> 00:24:01,019
让她或孩子不能旅行
She or the baby can't travel?

570
00:24:01,020 --> 00:24:03,440
没有  梅现在十分健康  孩子也是
No, Mei's perfectly healthy now and so is the baby.

571
00:24:03,460 --> 00:24:04,959
他们明天就要出院了
They're scheduled to be released tomorrow.

572
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:06,109
"现在"是什么意思
What do you mean, "Now"?

573
00:24:06,110 --> 00:24:07,409
她是前置胎盘患者
She had placenta previa.

574
00:24:07,410 --> 00:24:09,449
我建议她不要上班  休息几个星期
I advised her to take a couple of weeks off work.

575
00:24:09,450 --> 00:24:11,159
她是否按照你建议的去做了呢
Do you know if she followed your advice?

576
00:24:11,160 --> 00:24:14,440
我想是的  她的雇主打过电话过来确诊
I assume so. Her employer called to verify diagnosis.

577
00:24:14,660 --> 00:24:15,970
是吗
Really?

578
00:24:16,630 --> 00:24:18,779
这是她被解雇前多久的事情呢
How long was this before she was let go?

579
00:24:18,780 --> 00:24:20,509
一个月左右吧
They fired her about a month later.

580
00:24:20,510 --> 00:24:23,529
他们还问了一些关于潜在并发症的问题
They also asked a number of questions about potential complications.

581
00:24:23,530 --> 00:24:24,999
听起来他们想钓些别的信息
Sounds like they were fishing.

582
00:24:25,000 --> 00:24:28,359
小公司总是怕承担并发性妊娠的医疗费用
Smaller companies get afraid of the expense of complicated pregnancies.

583
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:30,599
所以也许他们是怕付钱太多
So maybe they thought it was gonna get more expensive

584
00:24:30,600 --> 00:24:31,739
-所以就让她走人了  -他们得知道
-And let her go.  -They'd have to know

585
00:24:31,740 --> 00:24:33,959
因为女性怀孕而解雇她是违法的
It's not legal to terminate a woman for being pregnant.

586
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:35,759
没错  但如果你存心想让她走
Yeah, but if you wanted her gone,

587
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,900
你就会编一些其他理由来解雇她
You'd manufacture some other reason to let her go.

588
00:24:38,490 --> 00:24:41,180
我猜南加州混凝土公司当时就是这么做的
I'm guessing that's exactly what Socal did.

589
00:24:50,040 --> 00:24:51,359
这都是什么啊
What's all this?

590
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:52,619
花
Flowers...

591
00:24:52,620 --> 00:24:54,870
巧克力  还有一只小袋鼠
...chocolates, and a tiny kangaroo.

592
00:24:55,110 --> 00:24:56,699
看来有人喜欢你哦
Looks like someone likes you.

593
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:59,669
貌似有人喜欢你  而且是个澳大利亚人哦
Someone like likes you. Someone australian.

594
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:01,610
真贴心  你看这小耳朵
It's really sweet. Look at his little ears.

595
00:25:01,870 --> 00:25:04,850
这才不贴心  简直又笨又懒
It's not sweet. It's clueless and lazy.

596
00:25:07,240 --> 00:25:10,939
我刚回到办公室  那些都是你干的吗
So, I was just in my office. Was all that you?

597
00:25:10,940 --> 00:25:12,829
你是说那些爱菠菠花店的花
Do you mean the flowers from Apropos,

598
00:25:12,830 --> 00:25:15,619
美宜堡巧克力店的巧克力  还有
The truffles from Malibu chocolates, and --

599
00:25:15,620 --> 00:25:16,999
还有这只袋鼠公仔
And the stuffed kangaroo.

600
00:25:17,000 --> 00:25:18,249
是沙袋鼠
It's a wallaby.

601
00:25:18,250 --> 00:25:21,339
叫小小袋鼠也行  但比袋鼠可爱多了
They're macropods, also, but they're cuter than kangaroos.

602
00:25:21,340 --> 00:25:23,709
我是在取悦你  不错吧
I'm courting you. Great, huh?

603
00:25:23,710 --> 00:25:26,429
首先  我对百合过敏
Well, first of all, I'm allergic to lilies.

604
00:25:26,430 --> 00:25:29,569
其次  我会把那些巧克力都吃掉的
Secondly, I'm going to eat every single one of those truffles,

605
00:25:29,570 --> 00:25:33,409
最后  袋鼠公仔
And finally -- a stuffed kangaroo?

606
00:25:33,410 --> 00:25:36,379
是沙袋鼠  听着  我只是想缓和一下局面
Wallaby. Look, I'm just trying to smooth things over.

607
00:25:36,380 --> 00:25:37,909
我是说  那晚你不想见我
I mean, you didn't want to see me the other night.

608
00:25:37,910 --> 00:25:39,459
-知道我为什么不想见你吗  -不知道
- Do you know why I didn't want to see you?  - No.

609
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:42,699
因为你不想和我沟通  不想和我去约会
Because you don't want to talk to me. You don't want to go out with me.

610
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:45,166
你只是想和我在各种不同的地方做爱
You just want to go to various different locations and have sex with me.

611
00:25:45,166 --> 00:25:47,120
在你脑海里  谈恋爱就是这样的
That's your idea of a relationship.

612
00:25:47,480 --> 00:25:49,073
就算送珠宝项链给我
And no amount of awesome swag

613
00:25:49,074 --> 00:25:51,020
也不能改变我对你的想法
Could convince me otherwise.

614
00:25:51,100 --> 00:25:53,699
你会发现很多拥有美好恋情的人
Uh, I think you'll find that's a lot of people's idea

615
00:25:53,700 --> 00:25:55,600
都有着同样的想法
Of a pretty good relationship!

616
00:25:58,850 --> 00:26:00,710
进展不太顺利啊  伙计
Didn't go down so well, huh, buddy?

617
00:26:01,010 --> 00:26:02,820
都是我的错  与你无关
That was more about me than you.

618
00:26:09,570 --> 00:26:11,259
我们觉得南加州混凝土公司
We think Socal Concrete

619
00:26:11,260 --> 00:26:12,819
解雇你是因为你怀孕了
Fired you because you were pregnant.

620
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:15,229
但他们说是因为我工作疏忽了
They said they fired me because my work had slipped.

621
00:26:15,230 --> 00:26:16,909
我传唤过了你的雇佣记录
I subpoenaed your employee records.

622
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:18,619
你的档案里没有证据能证明那点
There was nothing in your file to support that,

623
00:26:18,620 --> 00:26:21,209
也就是说我们可以控诉他们非法结束合同
Which means we can sue for wrongful termination.

624
00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:22,929
但我的确旷工挺多的
But I did miss a lot of work.

625
00:26:22,930 --> 00:26:24,839
不能因为需要产前护理而解雇你
You can't be fired for prenatal care.

626
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:26,269
这是种歧视
That's discrimination.

627
00:26:26,270 --> 00:26:27,694
我们赢了这场官司会怎样 
What if we win the suit?  

628
00:26:27,695 --> 00:26:28,899
梅就可以拿回她的工作
We get Mei her job back

629
00:26:28,900 --> 00:26:30,519
那她就可以再次拿到工作签证了
And her work visa will be restated.

630
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:32,609
所以她只能靠工作签证来待在美国了
So she has to rely on her work visa forever?

631
00:26:32,610 --> 00:26:35,209
签证能让她在美国待上足够长的时间
Well, the visa will keep her in the country long enough

632
00:26:35,210 --> 00:26:37,059
等到将私法法案提交国会
To get the private bill through congress.

633
00:26:37,060 --> 00:26:40,519
只要法案通过  就可以拿到绿卡了
Once it passes, the road to citizenship opens up.

634
00:26:40,520 --> 00:26:43,690
这是个延期计划  但我想应该能行的
It's another stall tactic, but I think it may work.

635
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:53,489
听着
Uh, listen

636
00:26:53,490 --> 00:26:55,209
昨天的事
About yesterday...

637
00:26:55,210 --> 00:26:56,259
对不起
I'm sorry.

638
00:26:56,260 --> 00:26:58,379
我  额  我不该那么混蛋的
I, um, you know, I should have been less of a jackass.

639
00:26:58,380 --> 00:26:59,609
你是在帮我的忙
You did a nice thing for me.

640
00:26:59,610 --> 00:27:01,050
我接受道歉
Apology accepted.

641
00:27:02,930 --> 00:27:04,590
我只是...
Yeah, I just, uh...

642
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:08,549
你知道的  艾瑞克的事
You know, with Eric --

643
00:27:08,550 --> 00:27:10,359
我还在想怎么解决
I'm still figuring out how to do it.

644
00:27:10,360 --> 00:27:12,500
-我无法想象是什么滋味  -是的
-I can't imagine what it's like.  -Yeah.

645
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,479
这是自从我们的父母去世之后
This is really the first big thing I've had to deal with

646
00:27:19,480 --> 00:27:21,300
遇到的第一件大事
Since our parents died.

647
00:27:21,570 --> 00:27:24,159
当他告诉我你插了一手的时候
And, you know, when he told me how you stepped in,

648
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:26,930
真的让我觉得自己...
It just really reminded me of how I...

649
00:27:28,010 --> 00:27:29,880
很无能
...feel totally overmatched

650
00:27:29,990 --> 00:27:33,050
-以及我的家人以前能处理得多好  -不
- And how my folks would have handled it so much better.  - No.

651
00:27:33,400 --> 00:27:35,039
他们不会处理得更好的
They wouldn't have handled it better.

652
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,749
只是他们可能会有别的处理办法
Maybe they would have handled it differently.

653
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:39,449
他因为带了童军奖到学校而被停课了
He's getting kicked out for having a cub scout prize.

654
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:40,189
他们说那是刀子
They're calling it a knife,

655
00:27:40,190 --> 00:27:41,737
是绝对不能容忍的
And they're saying they have a zero-tolerance policy.

656
00:27:41,738 --> 00:27:43,729
我试着去找那些人理论
Now, I really tried to reason with these people.

657
00:27:43,730 --> 00:27:45,850
艾瑞克说他们童子军是在学校集合的
Eric told me that his cub scouts meet at the school.

658
00:27:45,860 --> 00:27:47,500
是的  在体育馆里  所以呢
Yeah, in the gym. So?

659
00:27:48,420 --> 00:27:50,199
鲍威尔对布恩
Powell V.S. Bunn.

660
00:27:50,200 --> 00:27:51,869
在学校进行的比赛
Activities that take place at the school

661
00:27:51,870 --> 00:27:53,539
被认做是通过学校批准的
Are considered approved by the school.

662
00:27:53,540 --> 00:27:55,429
因为童子军在体育馆集合
Because the cub scouts meet in the gym,

663
00:27:55,430 --> 00:27:57,239
学校批准了他们的活动
The school sanctions their activities.

664
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:00,059
包括了艾瑞克获胜的搭帐篷比赛
Including the contest where Eric won his camp set.

665
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:03,319
他们要因他们自己造成的错误而惩罚他
T-they're trying to punish him for something they themselves caused.

666
00:28:03,320 --> 00:28:04,195
他们不能这样做  不是吗
And they can't do that, can they?

667
00:28:04,196 --> 00:28:08,100
是的  他们不能
No, they can't.

668
00:28:16,670 --> 00:28:19,479
不是吧  你的秘书说
Seriously? Your secretary said --

669
00:28:19,480 --> 00:28:21,329
别吵  在纾解压力呢
Shh. This is stress relief.

670
00:28:21,330 --> 00:28:23,079
我在度迷你假期呢
I'm on a mini vacation.

671
00:28:23,080 --> 00:28:24,880
我在神游茂伊岛呢
I'm in Maui in my mind.

672
00:28:30,570 --> 00:28:32,569
好了  什么事
Now... what can I do for you?

673
00:28:32,570 --> 00:28:34,049
你说取悦贝希  我照做了
You say court beth, so I do.

674
00:28:34,050 --> 00:28:36,339
我给她买了花  巧克力  还有一只可爱的沙袋鼠
I buy her flowers, chocolates, an awesome wallaby,

675
00:28:36,340 --> 00:28:38,129
可她说我只是想和她做爱
And all she can say is I just want to have sex with her.

676
00:28:38,130 --> 00:28:39,529
-贝希  -我说了贝希吗
-Beth?  -Did I say "Beth"?

677
00:28:39,530 --> 00:28:40,999
你从没告诉我是贝希
You never told me it was Beth.

678
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,099
是的  我没说
No. I didn't.

679
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:43,929
因为没人知道  我们没告诉任何人
Because nobody knows because we're not telling anyone.

680
00:28:43,930 --> 00:28:46,119
除了艾迪  现在还有你
Except Addy. And now you.

681
00:28:46,120 --> 00:28:47,421
所以  拜托不要告诉任何人
So, please don't tell anyone else.

682
00:28:47,422 --> 00:28:49,079
如果我早知道是贝希的话
Well, if I had known it was Beth,

683
00:28:49,080 --> 00:28:51,299
我就不会叫你买那些糖和花了
I never would have suggested the standard candy and flowers.

684
00:28:51,300 --> 00:28:52,829
不管怎样  送女生一只袋鼠
Regardless, it's never a good idea

685
00:28:52,830 --> 00:28:54,489
-从来就不是好主意  -沙袋鼠
-To give a woman a kangaroo.  -Wallaby.

686
00:28:54,490 --> 00:28:55,869
-迷你袋鼠  -比袋鼠可爱
- Tiny kangaroo.  - Cuter than kangaroos.

687
00:28:55,870 --> 00:28:58,130
-你只是想和贝希上床吗  -不是的
-Do you just want to have sex with Beth?  -No.

688
00:28:58,550 --> 00:29:00,239
想是想  但不是"只想"
I mean yes, but not just, no.

689
00:29:00,240 --> 00:29:04,389
黎姆  贝希是个极度复杂又聪明的女人
Liam, Beth is a highly complex and intelligent woman.

690
00:29:04,390 --> 00:29:07,209
我想男人们总是让她失望的
Men, I suspect, have always been a disappointment to her.

691
00:29:07,210 --> 00:29:08,939
-很好  -是很好  知道为什么吗
-Great.  -It is great. You know why?

692
00:29:08,940 --> 00:29:10,299
因为你要让她知道
It's great because you get to be the man

693
00:29:10,300 --> 00:29:13,000
所有人的招数都是一样的
To reveal all the others to be pale imitations.

694
00:29:13,000 --> 00:29:15,190
你要给她从没有人给过她的东西
You get to give her what no man has ever given her before

695
00:29:15,320 --> 00:29:16,729
真实的你
The real you.

696
00:29:16,730 --> 00:29:17,710
所以是
So...

697
00:29:18,780 --> 00:29:20,690
裸体的我
Naked me.

698
00:29:21,000 --> 00:29:24,010
我是说  坦诚的我
I mean, inside naked me.

699
00:29:24,030 --> 00:29:25,479
就知道你会懂的
You see? I knew it.

700
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:27,370
诗人的灵魂
Soul of a poet.

701
00:29:27,380 --> 00:29:30,269
哦  我幻想的鸡尾酒来啦
Ooh, look -- here come my imaginary pina coladas!

702
00:29:30,270 --> 00:29:32,579
非常感谢  兰德尔  见到你真好  伙计
Thank you very much, Randall. Good to see you, my friend.

703
00:29:32,580 --> 00:29:37,140
麻烦再拿一杯给我刚开窍的年轻同事
Please bring another one for my newly enlightened young colleague.

704
00:29:40,770 --> 00:29:42,870
爽死了
That hit the sweet spot.

705
00:29:43,360 --> 00:29:45,440
爽
Yessiree.

706
00:29:52,140 --> 00:29:53,496
好消息是
So, the good news is

707
00:29:53,497 --> 00:29:56,499
貌似我们会赢得这个性骚扰的案子
Looks like we're gonna win the sexual-harassment case.

708
00:29:56,500 --> 00:29:59,039
的确是个好消息
That is very good news.

709
00:29:59,040 --> 00:30:00,520
还要说坏消息吗
Do we need the bad news?

710
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,259
怎了
What?

711
00:30:04,260 --> 00:30:06,339
没啥  真的  只是
Nothing. Really, it...

712
00:30:06,340 --> 00:30:07,850
只是
It's just

713
00:30:07,980 --> 00:30:10,219
拜托  别扭捏了  行不
Okay, do not coy. Please, okay?

714
00:30:10,220 --> 00:30:12,039
我可受不了
I just can't stand coy.

715
00:30:12,040 --> 00:30:13,459
雷诺兹语带冒犯
Reynolds made an offensive remark

716
00:30:13,460 --> 00:30:15,910
关于他"经典"的女性管理方式
About the "typical" conduct of his female executives.

717
00:30:16,660 --> 00:30:18,059
我知道  这是不可起诉的
I know, it's not actionable.

718
00:30:18,060 --> 00:30:19,209
但这让我们想到
But it made us think.

719
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:20,889
如果他对我们都能这样说了
If he's willing to say something like that to us,

720
00:30:20,890 --> 00:30:22,549
那他也许工作时也是这么说话的
It might be his operating principle.

721
00:30:22,550 --> 00:30:24,259
可以这样推测
That is a stretch.

722
00:30:24,260 --> 00:30:26,299
所以我们调查了到底有多少女性
Which is why we checked into exactly how many women

723
00:30:26,300 --> 00:30:28,190
在美国女士内衣公司里做到了高级主管
Hold senior-management positions at American Lingerie.

724
00:30:28,420 --> 00:30:30,089
一个都没有
Exactly none.

725
00:30:30,090 --> 00:30:32,659
所有本应升任到更高职务的
Every woman at a V.P. level who logically would be

726
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:34,639
副总裁级别的女性
In the pipeline for senior-management positions

727
00:30:34,640 --> 00:30:37,209
在来到公司之后的18个月到三年间都辞职了
Quit 18 months to 3 years after arriving.

728
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:38,659
没有说服力
Not dispositive.

729
00:30:38,660 --> 00:30:40,559
时尚产业本来就变换得很快
The fashion industry has a very high turnover rate.

730
00:30:40,560 --> 00:30:42,839
是的  但是这家公司的离职率
Yes, but the departure rate at American Lingerie

731
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:44,929
比同产业的其他公司高出许多
Is much higher than the average of similar businesses.

732
00:30:44,930 --> 00:30:46,889
而且他们的男性主管都不会这样
And the same is not true for their male executives.

733
00:30:46,890 --> 00:30:48,729
在人力资源部面试的时候
In their H.R. departure interviews,

734
00:30:48,730 --> 00:30:50,589
虽然没有女性表示有性骚扰
Although none of the women cited sexual harassment,

735
00:30:50,590 --> 00:30:52,399
但近乎所有的女性都提到
Almost all of them mentioned that the climate

736
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:54,269
这家公司的工作氛围不适合她们
At American Lingerie didn't suit them.

737
00:30:54,270 --> 00:30:55,629
好吧  所以  你们的想法是
All right, so, your theory is

738
00:30:55,630 --> 00:30:57,459
虽然在法律上
Although he may not be technically guilty

739
00:30:57,460 --> 00:30:58,909
他也许没构成实质的性骚扰
Of sexually harassing anyone,

740
00:30:58,910 --> 00:31:01,329
但他造成了切实的女性升职障碍
He has built a bulletproof glass ceiling?

741
00:31:01,330 --> 00:31:02,267
不仅仅是一种想法
It's more than a theory.

742
00:31:02,268 --> 00:31:03,909
所有的数据都表明了
All the data points to the fact

743
00:31:03,910 --> 00:31:05,349
多年来他一直性歧视
That he's been sexually discriminating

744
00:31:05,350 --> 00:31:07,179
他的女雇员们
Against his female employees for years.

745
00:31:07,180 --> 00:31:09,909
而且雷诺兹在时尚界的势力太强
And Reynolds is so powerful in the fashion community

746
00:31:09,910 --> 00:31:11,910
这些女士都不想做出头鸟
That none of these women want to step forward.

747
00:31:11,950 --> 00:31:13,750
她们怕被排斥
They're afraid of being blackballed.

748
00:31:14,050 --> 00:31:15,560
所以  我们该怎么办呢
So, what are we gonna do?

749
00:31:17,370 --> 00:31:19,600
你们什么都不用做
You're not gonna do anything.

750
00:31:25,130 --> 00:31:26,499
我可不想和你打架
I don't want to fight.

751
00:31:26,500 --> 00:31:28,539
我不是来打架的
I'm not here to fight.

752
00:31:28,540 --> 00:31:30,120
我是来
I'm...

753
00:31:30,690 --> 00:31:32,530
想让你帮个忙
Here to ask you a favor.

754
00:31:33,460 --> 00:31:34,969
雷诺兹的案子需要帮忙
Need help on the Reynolds case.

755
00:31:34,970 --> 00:31:36,419
性骚扰案件吗
The sexual-harassment suit?

756
00:31:36,420 --> 00:31:38,100
我听懂你的讽刺了
I'm aware of the irony.

757
00:31:39,210 --> 00:31:41,059
看来  问题变得严重了
It appears that the problem runs deeper

758
00:31:41,060 --> 00:31:44,010
不仅仅是性骚扰的投诉了
Than one sexual-harassment claim.

759
00:31:44,340 --> 00:31:46,529
他的问题是很体统的  而且很常见
His problem is systemic, it's widespread,

760
00:31:46,530 --> 00:31:50,720
并且我确定他不懂得要如何改正
and I'm absolutely certain he has no idea how to fix it.

761
00:31:51,250 --> 00:31:53,189
克里夫  你怎么会来找我帮忙
But, Cliff, why are you coming to me?

762
00:31:53,190 --> 00:31:55,429
考虑到最近发生的事情
Considering what has recently transpired,

763
00:31:55,430 --> 00:31:58,729
让我去劝狗改了吃屎的习性
I kind of feel a little oily going to a client

764
00:31:58,730 --> 00:32:01,859
这种事我觉得有些腻味
and telling a leopard to change his spots.

765
00:32:01,860 --> 00:32:03,029
所以你并不是在逃避
So this isn't about you weaseling out

766
00:32:03,030 --> 00:32:04,479
令你难堪的话题
of an uncomfortable conversation.

767
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:08,129
而是诚心向我讨教对吗
It's about me making the most of a teachable moment?

768
00:32:08,130 --> 00:32:11,180
布莱弗德和费舍尔都不错  但她们还嫩了点
Branford and Fisher are good lawyers, but they're green.

769
00:32:11,260 --> 00:32:13,359
她们将来还要遇到很多令人讨厌的委托人
This won't be their last unsavory client.

770
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:15,559
我找不到更合适的人选
And I can't think of anyone better

771
00:32:15,560 --> 00:32:17,800
向她们展示什么叫不卑不亢了
to show them what dignity looks like.

772
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,930
好吧
All right.

773
00:32:20,430 --> 00:32:22,040
我答应帮你
I'll help you.

774
00:32:23,490 --> 00:32:26,310
是为了布莱弗德和费舍尔
For Branford and Fisher.

775
00:32:27,070 --> 00:32:29,060
我知足了
I'll take what I can get.

776
00:32:35,790 --> 00:32:38,409
这很容易抉择  萨维尔先生
The choice is very simple, Mr. Sanville.

777
00:32:38,410 --> 00:32:41,199
贵公司如果不让她回去工作
Socal either gives our client her job back,

778
00:32:41,200 --> 00:32:43,699
我们就将以歧视罪名起诉你们
or we will hit you with a class-action discrimination lawsuit.

779
00:32:43,800 --> 00:32:45,309
我们没有歧视她
There is no discrimination here.

780
00:32:45,310 --> 00:32:47,339
是你们当事人的工作没达标
Your client's work wasn't up to snuff.

781
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,649
真是有趣的理论
Interesting theory --

782
00:32:48,650 --> 00:32:50,589
但你们根本没有记录能证明这点
Except none of your records support that.

783
00:32:50,590 --> 00:32:52,069
而且  你们公司还有人
Also, someone from your office

784
00:32:52,070 --> 00:32:54,679
曾打电话给她的医生询问关于她怀孕的事
called her doctor, asking about her pregnancy.

785
00:32:54,680 --> 00:32:57,089
要是你们想在上庭前和解
If you had any kind of case, you'd push to go before a jury.

786
00:32:57,090 --> 00:32:58,259
一定是为了争取庞大的和解费
You'd try for a big payout.

787
00:32:58,260 --> 00:32:59,068
算你们走运
Fortunately for you,

788
00:32:59,069 --> 00:33:00,820
这次我们的目的并不是赚钱
cash is not the motive here.

789
00:33:02,040 --> 00:33:03,399
我们只想尽快解决问题
We're interested in settling quickly

790
00:33:03,400 --> 00:33:06,049
避免让孩子和亲生母亲分开
to avoid separating a mother from her child.

791
00:33:06,050 --> 00:33:08,089
不过  如果贵公司固执己见
But, if Socal would prefer,

792
00:33:08,090 --> 00:33:09,169
我们很乐意去集结
we're more than happy to parade

793
00:33:09,170 --> 00:33:11,750
更多受害的年轻妈妈们一起上庭
a dozen sympathetic young mothers in front of a jury.

794
00:33:13,050 --> 00:33:14,129
他们能这样做吗
Can they do that?

795
00:33:14,130 --> 00:33:16,009
我保证我们会这样做
I assure you that's exactly what we'll do.

796
00:33:16,010 --> 00:33:18,089
我们会竭尽所能的  萨维尔先生
We'll pull out all the stops, Mr. Sanville,

797
00:33:18,090 --> 00:33:20,559
贵公司将支出好几百万
and Socal will be forced to pay millions in damages

798
00:33:20,560 --> 00:33:22,379
赔偿给所有被你解雇的怀孕女性
to the pregnant women you've fired.

799
00:33:22,380 --> 00:33:25,020
或者选择重新雇佣梅  你们看着办吧
Or you can rehire Mei. It's up to you.

800
00:33:42,760 --> 00:33:44,360
苏珊
Susan.

801
00:33:44,360 --> 00:33:45,660
他们告诉我你会顺道来访
They told me you gonna stop by.

802
00:33:46,020 --> 00:33:47,899
你还是这么漂亮
Ravishing, as always.

803
00:33:47,900 --> 00:33:50,739
两位小姐  很高兴再次见到你们
Ladies, it's a pleasure to see you both again.

804
00:33:50,740 --> 00:33:53,370
对了  这儿  打开看看  给你的
Oh. Oh, here. Open it. It's for you.

805
00:33:54,400 --> 00:33:56,459
庆祝胜利的小礼物
Just a little victory gift.

806
00:33:56,460 --> 00:33:58,460
克里夫会很感激我的
Cliff is gonna thank me.

807
00:33:59,490 --> 00:34:00,890
好吧
Okay.

808
00:34:01,690 --> 00:34:03,329
你还是得应对这场官司
You're going to settle this suit.

809
00:34:03,330 --> 00:34:05,679
什么  她们说她没有起诉我
What? Those two said that she had no claim.

810
00:34:05,680 --> 00:34:07,119
以性骚扰罪名吗  不对
For sexual harassment? No.

811
00:34:07,120 --> 00:34:09,309
我们相信卡恩小姐
We believe Ms. Kahn was having an emotional response

812
00:34:09,310 --> 00:34:10,779
是对你营造的企业文化感到反感
to the corporate culture you've created.

813
00:34:10,780 --> 00:34:11,344
总之 
Bottom line -- 

814
00:34:11,345 --> 00:34:14,999
你将因长期以来一贯的性别歧视而获罪
you're guilty of consistent and sustained sexual discrimination.

815
00:34:15,000 --> 00:34:17,409
什么  慢着  拉兹亚说的吗
What? Wait, Rhazia said this?

816
00:34:17,410 --> 00:34:18,669
-暂时  还没有  -那么
- Not yet, no. - Then --

817
00:34:18,670 --> 00:34:21,659
罗宾  你得让她愉快地离开
Robin, you need her to go away happy.

818
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:23,859
如果她想清楚了你的所作所为
If she figures out what you've been doing

819
00:34:23,860 --> 00:34:26,019
然后到处败坏你的名声  她能毁了
and makes a stink about it, she could destroy

820
00:34:26,020 --> 00:34:28,190
这家公司和你个人
American lingerie and you personally.

821
00:34:29,090 --> 00:34:30,679
这太可笑了
This is ridiculous.

822
00:34:30,680 --> 00:34:31,514
我从没想让我公司里的
I've never intended to keep

823
00:34:31,515 --> 00:34:33,119
任何一个女士失望
any of the women in my company down.

824
00:34:33,120 --> 00:34:34,889
你的真正想法
Well, your actual intentions

825
00:34:34,890 --> 00:34:36,609
是你和你的私人治疗师的事情
are a matter for you and your therapist.

826
00:34:36,610 --> 00:34:39,470
但你送我的这件不可思议
However, as proven by this incredibly

827
00:34:39,471 --> 00:34:42,590
又不合时宜的礼物就是最好的证明
inappropriate gift to me,

828
00:34:43,020 --> 00:34:45,739
你的行为模式一上法庭就无所遁形了
your pattern of conduct will be clear to any court of law.

829
00:34:45,740 --> 00:34:47,729
所以你得采取措施  得做出改变
So you're going to settle, you're going to change,

830
00:34:47,730 --> 00:34:50,809
而且你也不准再送内衣给我的律师了
and you're going to stop sending underwear to my lawyers,

831
00:34:50,810 --> 00:34:52,790
因为即使不构成诉讼条件
Because while it may not be actionable,

832
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:55,720
这也很难看  而且很无趣
It's ugly -- and obvious.

833
00:34:58,990 --> 00:35:00,620
你酷毙了
You are my hero.

834
00:35:07,020 --> 00:35:09,979
我听说那个性骚扰的案子解决了
Hey, I heard the sexual-harassment case got settled.

835
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:12,509
没错  多亏了苏珊  她太厉害了
Yeah, thanks to Susan. That woman is amazing.

836
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:13,969
总有一天我也要学会她的手段
One day, I will have her mad skills.

837
00:35:13,970 --> 00:35:16,219
你也有你自己的疯狂手段
You got some pretty mad skills of your own.

838
00:35:16,220 --> 00:35:17,579
比如鲍威尔与布恩的事
Powell vs. Bunn?

839
00:35:17,580 --> 00:35:19,939
奏效了吗  他们不会让艾瑞克停学了吗
It worked? They're not gonna suspend Eric?

840
00:35:19,940 --> 00:35:21,969
没错  谢谢你  艾迪
She's not. Thank you, Addy.

841
00:35:21,970 --> 00:35:24,519
我真高兴他们撤销了停学通告
I'm just so happy they lifted the suspension

842
00:35:24,520 --> 00:35:26,049
他真的是个很不错的孩子
'cause he's really an awesome kid.

843
00:35:26,050 --> 00:35:28,600
我也很高兴  他的确很不错
Me too. He is.

844
00:35:29,450 --> 00:35:30,730
怎么了
What's wrong?

845
00:35:31,170 --> 00:35:31,969
如果我不够好怎么办
What if I'm not enough?

846
00:35:31,970 --> 00:35:33,689
我是说  我知道怎么做哥哥
I mean, I know how to be a brother.

847
00:35:33,690 --> 00:35:35,339
但我不知道怎么做好监护人
I just don't know how to be the guardians.

848
00:35:35,340 --> 00:35:36,519
你们俩经历过这么多
With everything you two have been through,

849
00:35:36,520 --> 00:35:37,184
我想你已经渐渐学会了
I think you're doing it.

850
00:35:37,185 --> 00:35:38,929
我想他也是这么认为的
And I think he thinks so, too.

851
00:35:38,930 --> 00:35:40,289
是吗
Yeah?

852
00:35:40,290 --> 00:35:41,609
除了做饭
Except for the cooking.

853
00:35:41,610 --> 00:35:42,959
他肯定觉得你做饭很不在行
I thk he thinks you suck at cooking.

854
00:35:42,960 --> 00:35:44,247
他不会是使出了"我好可怜
He did not play the "Poor me,

855
00:35:44,248 --> 00:35:45,749
马尔科姆不给我吃的"的戏码吧
Malcolm doesn't feed me" card?

856
00:35:45,750 --> 00:35:47,389
那孩子很喜欢晚餐吃燕麦粥的
That kid loves cereal for dinner.

857
00:35:47,390 --> 00:35:48,919
是啊  我想他只是不想打击你
Yeah. I think he's just being nice.

858
00:35:49,120 --> 00:35:50,679
不如你今晚过来
Well, why don't you come by tonight,

859
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:52,779
我们准备晚餐来感谢你  怎么样
and we'll cook you dinner to thank you?

860
00:35:52,780 --> 00:35:53,729
我不知道
I don't know.

861
00:35:53,830 --> 00:35:56,140
我发誓  绝对没别的意思
I swear -- nothing with a prize in it.

862
00:35:58,630 --> 00:36:00,349
那家伙是个十足的混蛋
That guy was always such a jackass.

863
00:36:00,350 --> 00:36:02,259
我希望你能把他带入正道
I hope you set him on the right path.

864
00:36:02,260 --> 00:36:03,869
我把连袜内衣扔在他脸上了
I threw a body stocking at him.

865
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:06,259
这让人非常有满足感
It was very gratifying.

866
00:36:06,260 --> 00:36:07,890
那么
So, uh...

867
00:36:09,290 --> 00:36:10,989
关于挖墙脚
This job offer --

868
00:36:10,990 --> 00:36:13,509
拜托  哈特  并不是我主动找上门去的
Oh, come on, Hart. I didn't go looking for it.

869
00:36:13,510 --> 00:36:15,519
我知道你没有
I'm sure you didn't.

870
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:16,929
不过  我们坦诚一点
But come on, let's be honest now.

871
00:36:16,930 --> 00:36:17,989
这次不太一样  不是吗
It's different this time, right?

872
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:19,629
你确实有在考虑
You're actually considering it --

873
00:36:19,630 --> 00:36:22,119
当然有一部分原因跟克里夫有关
and partly because of the situation with Cliff.

874
00:36:22,120 --> 00:36:25,689
我在这里真的很难熬  好吗
It's hard for me around here, okay?

875
00:36:25,790 --> 00:36:28,599
你想让我怎么做呢
What do you want me to do?

876
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:29,889
-顺其自然吗  -不不不
- Just let it slide? - No, no, no.

877
00:36:29,890 --> 00:36:31,339
我不知道要让你怎么做
I don't know what to tell you to do.

878
00:36:31,340 --> 00:36:35,120
不过我想说  我觉得他在努力
Um...but I will say that I-I think he's trying.

879
00:36:35,300 --> 00:36:37,249
比如  把雷诺兹的案子交给你
I mean, bringing you this Reynolds thing --

880
00:36:37,250 --> 00:36:39,139
说实话  当他跟我谈论
To be honest, when he started to talk to me

881
00:36:39,140 --> 00:36:40,729
那家公司的问题时
about the problems at American lingerie,

882
00:36:40,730 --> 00:36:43,249
我甚至不知道他是在说案子  还是说他自己
I didn't know if he was talking about the case or himself.

883
00:36:43,250 --> 00:36:44,910
是啊  克里夫向来如此
Yeah, that's Cliff.

884
00:36:45,910 --> 00:36:48,050
我认为你还是应该开诚布公  苏珊
But I do think you need to air it out, Susan.

885
00:36:48,190 --> 00:36:49,379
好好跟他谈谈
Talk to him.

886
00:36:49,380 --> 00:36:51,689
然后你才能知道你是要离开他
Then you'll know whether you're gonna leave him

887
00:36:51,690 --> 00:36:54,140
还是原谅他  还是其他的决定
or -- or forgive him or whatever you decide.

888
00:36:54,840 --> 00:36:56,789
然后你会知道  自己曾站定在那里
And you'll know that you stood in there,

889
00:36:56,790 --> 00:36:57,929
挥出了全力的一击
and you took a full swing at it.

890
00:36:57,930 --> 00:37:00,609
靠  我"爱死"你的棒球术语暗喻了
God, I love it when you start with the baseball metaphors.

891
00:37:00,610 --> 00:37:02,319
不好意思啊
I'm so sorry.

892
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:04,639
听着  总而言之
Look, bottom line is,

893
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:08,510
如果你不去面对  对他不公平
if you don't confront it, it's not fair to him.

894
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:12,740
好吧  对你自己也不公平
Okay, you're not being fair to yourself.

895
00:37:12,980 --> 00:37:15,260
再唯利是图一点
And as mercenary as it sounds,

896
00:37:15,270 --> 00:37:17,790
对公司也不公平
you're not being fair to the firm.

897
00:37:29,890 --> 00:37:31,549
我做了千层面
I made Lasagna.

898
00:37:31,550 --> 00:37:33,389
说好由我们来做晚餐的
We're supposed to make you dinner.

899
00:37:33,390 --> 00:37:35,839
是指盒饭  罐头或外卖吗
Does that involve a box, a can, or ordering in?

900
00:37:35,840 --> 00:37:37,640
什么口味的千层面
What kind of Lasagna?

901
00:37:40,330 --> 00:37:41,599
-艾迪  -艾瑞克
- Addy? - Eric!

902
00:37:41,599 --> 00:37:42,809
好香啊
Something smells good.

903
00:37:42,810 --> 00:37:44,799
把这个拿去烤一下
Here, put this in the oven for a little bit.

904
00:37:44,800 --> 00:37:45,969
设在350度
350 degrees.

905
00:37:45,970 --> 00:37:48,280
我们终于要用到烤箱了吗  帅
We get to use the oven? Awesome.

906
00:37:54,590 --> 00:37:56,460
那么
So...

907
00:37:57,810 --> 00:38:00,380
请我过来却不请我进去吗
You invited me over. You gonna invite me in?

908
00:38:04,010 --> 00:38:06,239
他不停地吃啊吃的
He just eats and eats.

909
00:38:06,240 --> 00:38:08,200
他真像他爸爸
He takes after his father.

910
00:38:10,180 --> 00:38:13,200
医生说我们早上就能出院了
The doctor says we can leave in the morning.

911
00:38:15,580 --> 00:38:18,740
对你们俩来说都只是一小段旅程
Well, it'll be a short trip for both of you.

912
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:20,180
南加州混凝土公司妥协了  
Socal settled. 

913
00:38:20,181 --> 00:38:21,016
他们接受了我们的条件
They agreed to our terms.

914
00:38:21,017 --> 00:38:22,949
你可以留在美国了
You can stay in America.

915
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:26,269
亲爱的  太好了
Honey, that's great.

916
00:38:26,270 --> 00:38:28,779
你会被重新录用直到法案通过
You'll be employed by Socal till the private bill passes.

917
00:38:28,780 --> 00:38:30,399
不会超过6个月的
Shouldn't take more than six months.

918
00:38:30,400 --> 00:38:33,629
我不知道要说什么才好  太谢谢你了
I don't know what to say, but thank you.

919
00:38:33,630 --> 00:38:35,099
你应该好好谢谢这个年轻人
Oh, well, make sure you thank this young man.

920
00:38:35,100 --> 00:38:39,190
-都是他的功劳  -你让我们家庭能够团聚
- He did all the work. - You kept our family together.

921
00:38:39,430 --> 00:38:41,029
-非常感谢  -没关系
- Thank you. - You're welcome.

922
00:38:41,030 --> 00:38:43,620
赫威特先生  想抱抱克里斯托夫吗
Mr. Hewitt, would you like to hold Christopher?

923
00:38:45,480 --> 00:38:47,090
做得好
Nicely done.

924
00:38:48,250 --> 00:38:49,920
他跟你长得很像
He looks like you.

925
00:38:51,920 --> 00:38:53,020
你好  小家伙
Hello, buddy?

926
00:39:11,070 --> 00:39:13,849
很高兴你还在这儿
Hey, I'm glad you're still here.

927
00:39:13,850 --> 00:39:16,289
我有样东西想跟你分享
Uh, there's something I wanted to share with you.

928
00:39:16,290 --> 00:39:19,149
我猜猜  是回旋镖还是蔬菜三明治
Let me guess. It's either a boomerang or a vegemite sandwich.

929
00:39:19,150 --> 00:39:22,200
不不  不太一样
No, no. It's...different.

930
00:39:24,060 --> 00:39:25,549
听着  我是个男人
Look, I'm a guy.

931
00:39:25,550 --> 00:39:29,079
对我来说  有时候
And as such, my love of sex

932
00:39:29,080 --> 00:39:31,880
对性的热衷阻碍了一切
sometimes gets in the way of, let's say, everything.

933
00:39:33,110 --> 00:39:35,540
可关键是  我真的很在乎你
But the thing is, I really care about you --

934
00:39:36,330 --> 00:39:38,380
真正的你
the real you.

935
00:39:38,390 --> 00:39:42,390
内在的你
The naked inside you.

936
00:39:42,490 --> 00:39:45,439
-好吧  我听着呢  -我为你写了首诗
- Okay. Still listening. - I wrote you a poem.

937
00:39:45,440 --> 00:39:48,259
-上帝  不要诗歌  -我还安排了配乐
- Oh, god, No. No poems. - Then I set it to music.

938
00:39:50,750 --> 00:39:53,200
没关系  听听看就好
It's all right. Just go with it.

939
00:39:55,380 --> 00:39:57,269
不要问我从哪里来
Where I come from,

940
00:39:57,270 --> 00:40:00,200
我的故乡在远方
the water swirls the wrong way down the loo.

941
00:40:00,210 --> 00:40:02,780
男人是勇敢的  而且很少刮胡子
The men are brave and seldom shave.

942
00:40:02,900 --> 00:40:04,559
女人则永远不会这样
The women never do.

943
00:40:04,560 --> 00:40:06,679
从这片奇异的焦土上
From this strange and sun-scorched land,

944
00:40:06,680 --> 00:40:08,669
我旅居至洛杉矶
I sojourned to L.A.

945
00:40:08,670 --> 00:40:10,336
独在异乡为异客  
Stranger still, 

946
00:40:10,337 --> 00:40:12,559
我却遇到了令我钟情的女孩
I meet a girl who takes my breath away.

947
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:15,109
一见倾心的瞬间  我便知道
And instantly, I know she's worth

948
00:40:15,110 --> 00:40:17,559
她值得我为她赴汤蹈火
each risk that lies ahead.

949
00:40:17,560 --> 00:40:21,340
她的淡定和悠闲让我受宠若惊
Her calm and comfort coming to my frightened foreign bed.

950
00:40:22,830 --> 00:40:25,389
我很痛苦  却总是犯错
I'm full of pain and full of faults.

951
00:40:25,390 --> 00:40:27,390
我们知道这是事实
We know this to be true.

952
00:40:27,950 --> 00:40:30,121
但我内心的野蛮与古怪
But all that's brute and odd in me

953
00:40:30,125 --> 00:40:32,065
得到了你的救赎
is redeemed in you.
