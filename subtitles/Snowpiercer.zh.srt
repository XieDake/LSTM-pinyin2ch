之所以失败都是因为没有夺取引擎
failed because they couldn't take the engine.

160
00:11:00,130 --> 00:11:01,710
你的意思是
What are you saying?

161
00:11:03,510 --> 00:11:05,330
这一次我们夺取引擎
This time we take the engine.

162
00:11:06,470 --> 00:11:07,950
之后呢
Then what?

163
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:12,000
杀了他们
We kill them.

164
00:11:12,120 --> 00:11:13,430
Wilford
Wilford?

165
00:11:19,450 --> 00:11:21,810
掌管这列车的人应该是你 而不是Wilford
You should run the train now, not Wilford.

166
00:11:23,070 --> 00:11:26,450
我不过是因袭前人
I am a shadow of my former shadow.

167
00:11:28,870 --> 00:11:31,240
我的时代早已不在
My day was decades ago.

168
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:34,620
Gilliam多大了
How old is Gilliam?

169
00:11:35,370 --> 00:11:36,920
闭嘴 Edgar
Shut up, Edgar.

170
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:39,890
我不是说希望这发生
I'm not saying that I want that to happen,

171
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:41,460
我不是这个意思
that's not what I'm saying.

172
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:45,920
我是说他终有一死
What I mean is he will die someday.

173
00:11:48,430 --> 00:11:51,100
当他死后 该是你的继承衣钵
And when that happens, you're gonna have to take over.

174
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:54,520
你来管理这辆列车
You're gonna have to run the train.

175
00:11:56,060 --> 00:11:57,690
我不是一个领袖
I am not a leader.

176
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,610
我也不清楚
I don't know.

177
00:12:03,190 --> 00:12:05,400
但问我的话我觉得你非常合适
I think you'd be pretty good if you ask me.

178
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:17,910
Edgar
Edgar.

179
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:22,290
你还能记起多少过去的事
How far back can you remember?

180
00:12:23,630 --> 00:12:25,210
我也不知道 像什么
I do not know, like what?

181
00:12:25,590 --> 00:12:28,220
你母亲 你还记得她吗
Your mother, you remember her?

182
00:12:33,220 --> 00:12:35,060
我依稀记得一张面容
I can remember a face...

183
00:12:36,520 --> 00:12:38,190
时时浮现
every once in a while.

184
00:12:40,810 --> 00:12:42,310
但不清晰
But it's not clear.

185
00:12:45,610 --> 00:12:47,160
所有人 都躺下
Stay down, everybody.

186
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:49,880
- 所有人待在原处  - 他妈的看着我
- Everybody stay in your place. - Fucking look at me.

187
00:12:50,350 --> 00:12:52,820
躺下 都躺下
Keep down, keep down.

188
00:12:56,380 --> 00:12:59,540
- 医疗检查 只需要小孩   - 所有小孩和我来
- Medical inspection. Just the kids. - All the kids come with me.

189
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:01,220
医疗检查而已
It's a medical check up.

190
00:13:01,490 --> 00:13:02,750
就是这样
You're doing good.

191
00:13:02,870 --> 00:13:05,300
所有孩子
Everybody, all the kids.

192
00:13:05,420 --> 00:13:07,920
- 所有孩子  - 你也是  - 没错 到那去
- All the kids? - You too. - That's right, just come.

193
00:13:08,930 --> 00:13:11,200
靠后 女士 请退后
Stay back there, ma'am. Just stay back there.

194
00:13:12,050 --> 00:13:14,140
还有一个
Alright, one more.

195
00:13:14,260 --> 00:13:16,940
快来
Yup, come on.

196
00:13:17,060 --> 00:13:19,140
你得过来
You need to go.

197
00:13:19,310 --> 00:13:22,880
医疗检查而已 你退后
It's just a medical check up. You just stay back there.

198
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:26,010
好了 和其他人一起
Come on, that's right. Come with the others, okay.

199
00:14:20,030 --> 00:14:21,620
你们 过去检查下
You, go and check.

200
00:14:21,740 --> 00:14:24,530
- 不许动  - 快跑 Timmy
- Don't move. - Go, Timmy!

201
00:14:34,100 --> 00:14:35,650
Timmy
Timmy!

202
00:14:42,340 --> 00:14:43,820
那是她的孩子
That's her baby!

203
00:14:46,860 --> 00:14:48,410
Andy
Andy!

204
00:14:49,100 --> 00:14:50,860
把儿子还给我
Give me back my son.

205
00:14:51,820 --> 00:14:54,590
还给我 你个臭婊子
Give me my son, you fucking bitch!

206
00:14:54,710 --> 00:14:56,300
Andy
Andy!

207
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:01,870
你们怎么能让他扔鞋子
How could you let him throw his shoe.

208
00:15:10,020 --> 00:15:13,320
- Timmy  - Tim
- Timmy! - Tim!

209
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:42,520
这种海拔之下 我们只需要7分钟
At this altitude, we need only 7 minutes.

210
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:29,530
您有7分钟演讲 女士
7 minutes allotted for your speech, sir.

211
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,710
这太令人失望了
This is so disappointing.

212
00:16:40,590 --> 00:16:44,010
不要全翻译 我们只有7分钟
We don't need all that, we only got 7 minutes.

213
00:16:52,520 --> 00:16:53,770
乘客们
Passengers...

214
00:16:54,780 --> 00:16:57,680
这并不是一只鞋
This is not a shoe.

215
00:16:58,150 --> 00:17:00,950
这是目无法纪
This is disorder.

216
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:04,700
这是10码的骚乱
This is size 10 chaos.

217
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:08,930
这个 看见了吗 就是死亡
This, you see this? This is death.

218
00:17:09,620 --> 00:17:13,380
在这趟我们称之为家的列车上 有一样东西
In this locomotive we call home, there is one thing...

219
00:17:13,540 --> 00:17:16,670
是它让我们不受冰寒 给我们带来温热
that between our warm hearts and the bitter cold...

220
00:17:17,060 --> 00:17:20,790
衣服 裤子 都不是 是秩序
Clothing? Jeans? No, order.

221
00:17:21,220 --> 00:17:25,370
是秩序将寒冷与死亡隔之门外
Order is the barrier that holds back the cold and death.

222
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:28,680
我们所有人 列车所有的人都必须
We must all of us, on this train of life...

223
00:17:28,850 --> 00:17:31,440
待在其既定的车厢
remain in our allotted stations...

224
00:17:31,810 --> 00:17:34,230
我们每个人都必须待在
we must each of us occupy...

225
00:17:34,440 --> 00:17:38,400
我们早已安排好的位置上
our preordained particulate positions.

226
00:17:44,990 --> 00:17:47,120
你会把鞋子穿在头上吗
Would you wear a shoe on your head?

227
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:49,380
你当然不会把鞋穿在头上
Of course you wouldn't wear a shoe on your head.

228
00:17:49,500 --> 00:17:51,120
因为它的位置不在头上
A shoe doesn't belong in your head.

229
00:17:51,290 --> 00:17:54,120
它的位置在脚上
A shoe belongs on your foot.

230
00:17:54,420 --> 00:17:56,840
帽子的位置才在头上
A hat belongs on your head.

231
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:59,510
而我就是帽子 你们就是鞋
I am a hat, you are a shoe.

232
00:17:59,670 --> 00:18:02,590
我的位置在头上 你们的位置在脚上
I belong on the head, you belong on the foot.

233
00:18:02,760 --> 00:18:05,150
懂了吗 就像这样
Yes? So it is.

234
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:09,100
最开始 你们买的票就规定了你们所在的位置
In the beginning, order was prescribed by your ticket.

235
00:18:09,220 --> 00:18:12,940
头等厢 经济厢 还有你们这些不请自来的
First bus, economy, and freeloaders like you.

236
00:18:13,060 --> 00:18:17,770
神圣的引擎决定着永恒的秩序
Eternal order is prescribed by the Sacred Engine.

237
00:18:17,980 --> 00:18:20,690
所有东西都来自神圣的引擎
All things flow from the Sacred Engine.

238
00:18:20,860 --> 00:18:22,610
所有事物都有自己的位置
All things in their place.

239
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:24,990
所有乘客都在已定的位置
All passengers in their sections.

240
00:18:25,120 --> 00:18:27,740
水的流动 热量的上升
All water flowing, all heat rise...

241
00:18:27,910 --> 00:18:30,620
都归功于神圣的引擎
pays homage to the Sacred Engine.

242
00:18:30,790 --> 00:18:34,000
在其早已决定好的
In it's own particulate...

243
00:18:34,250 --> 00:18:37,420
应用的位置上
preordained positions.

244
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:39,090
就是这样
So it is.

245
00:18:40,300 --> 00:18:43,050
从一开始
Now, as in the beginning...

246
00:18:43,180 --> 00:18:45,940
我就属于车头
I belong to the front.

247
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:50,380
你们属于车尾
You belong to the tail.

248
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,940
当脚试图取代头的地位
When the foot seeks the place of the head...

249
00:18:55,730 --> 00:18:57,610
他们就打破了神圣的界限
a sacred line is crossed.

250
00:18:58,320 --> 00:18:59,940
知道自己的位置
Know your place.

251
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,030
记住自己的位置
Keep your place.

252
00:19:03,030 --> 00:19:04,490
做好一只鞋
Be a shoe.

253
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:14,000
我们还剩42秒
We have 42 seconds left.

254
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:17,460
那我们可以和Wilford先生通一下话
So we can go to comment of Mr. Wilford,

255
00:19:17,670 --> 00:19:20,630
神圣引擎的伟大守护者
the divine keeper of the Sacred Engine.

256
00:19:22,630 --> 00:19:24,690
先生 Wilford先生
Sir? Mr. Wilford?

257
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,250
你在吗
Are you there?

258
00:19:29,990 --> 00:19:31,580
你在吗 先生
Are you there, sir?

259
00:19:34,890 --> 00:19:38,440
通讯断了
It's breaking up. Well...

260
00:19:38,560 --> 00:19:41,100
Wilford先生非常繁忙
Mr. Wilford's a very busy man.

261
00:19:41,650 --> 00:19:43,200
就这样
So it is.

262
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:03,480
我们就这么坐视不管吗
We're just gonna watch?

263
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:05,590
- 还不是时候  - 我他妈可不准备在这干坐着
- Not now. - I'm not just gonna fucking sit here.

264
00:20:40,210 --> 00:20:41,920
不用 没事
Nah, alright.

265
00:20:47,680 --> 00:20:50,390
站住 站在那儿 坐下
Stop, stop right there. Sit down.

266
00:20:50,510 --> 00:20:53,340
把那没用的枪放下 快放下
Put that useless gun down. Put it away.

267
00:20:54,270 --> 00:20:56,720
好久不见 Gilliam先生
Long time no see, Mr. Gilliam.

268
00:20:57,060 --> 00:20:58,440
见到你真荣幸
It's a pleasure!

269
00:21:02,020 --> 00:21:03,310
你看起来很健康
You look healthy.

270
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:06,420
他没事
He's fine.

271
00:21:16,540 --> 00:21:20,290
Mason部长 请帮我带个信给Wilford先生
Minister Mason, please deliver a message to Mr. Wilford.

272
00:21:20,460 --> 00:21:21,800
当然 要我转达什么
Certainly, what should I say?

273
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:25,050
告诉他我要和他谈一谈
Tell him he and I need to talk.

274
00:21:25,170 --> 00:21:28,130
有什么话跟我说也一样
Well, you can talk to me.

275
00:21:28,590 --> 00:21:31,520
Wilford没理由到这里来
Mr. Wilford has no reason to visit here.

276
00:21:32,140 --> 00:21:33,600
不在这里
Not here.

277
00:21:34,180 --> 00:21:35,690
在车头
At the front.

278
00:21:51,460 --> 00:21:54,120

Nice to hear it.

279

你的儿子会是个英雄的 我保证
Your son will be a hero, I promise.

280
00:21:56,370 --> 00:21:58,000
或者女儿 随便了
Or daughter, whatever it is.

281
00:21:58,410 --> 00:21:59,930
我来
I got it.

282
00:22:01,920 --> 00:22:05,020
- 你的贡献会被记住的  - 多谢

284
00:22:11,210 --> 00:22:13,010
非常抱歉
So sorry.

285
00:22:13,300 --> 00:22:15,970
这是你的佛像 非常感谢
There's your Buddha back, thanks very much.

286
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:22,000
让开 让开
Move! Move!

287
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:25,470
别瞎闹了
Stop fooling around.

288
00:22:53,380 --> 00:22:55,010
我有更好的货
I've got a better batch.

289
00:22:55,390 --> 00:22:58,350
更强劲 新鲜 未经切割
Stronger, fresh, uncut.

290
00:22:58,470 --> 00:23:00,260
想来点吗
Want to try some?

291
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:04,770
多少蛋白块能换10块未切割的柯洛诺
How many protein blocks for 10 rocks of uncut Kronol?

292
00:23:13,570 --> 00:23:15,140
他们没有子弹
They don't have bullets.

293
00:23:15,700 --> 00:23:17,320
你怎么知道的
Why do you say that?

294
00:23:18,280 --> 00:23:19,980
你还记得Mason说的话吗
You remember what Mason said?

295
00:23:19,980 --> 00:23:22,200
她说 把那没用的枪放下
She said, "Put down that useless gun".

296
00:23:22,870 --> 00:23:24,370
她的意思是
She meant...

297
00:23:24,710 --> 00:23:27,080
她不会下令杀了我
she wouldn't give the order to shoot me.

298
00:23:27,590 --> 00:23:28,690
不
No.

299
00:23:29,210 --> 00:23:32,040
我认为那些枪真的没用的
No, I think the guns are literally useless.

300
00:23:32,510 --> 00:23:35,880
他们在4年前的叛乱里用光了所有子弹
They've used up all their bullets 4 years ago on the last revolt.

301
00:23:38,310 --> 00:23:39,850
子弹已经绝迹了
Bullets are extinct.

302
00:23:40,470 --> 00:23:45,220
如果你猜错了 叛乱还没开始我们就会死
If you're wrong, we could be finish before we even start.

303
00:23:45,670 --> 00:23:47,770
我们该更耐心点
I think we should be patient.

304
00:23:48,770 --> 00:23:51,070
等下一张红纸条出现
Wait for the next red letter.

305
00:24:06,620 --> 00:24:08,840
向左
To the left.

306
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:10,630
再向右
And right.

307
00:24:10,750 --> 00:24:13,290
还不行 抬起来 往左
Not yet, up. Now left.

308
00:24:13,410 --> 00:24:16,390
好了
Good, good.

309
00:24:16,510 --> 00:24:22,890
1 2 1 2 1 2 1 2
1...2...1...2... 1...2...1...2...

310
00:24:30,430 --> 00:24:32,470
在吗 Andrew
Hello? Andrew.

311
00:24:32,940 --> 00:24:34,300
Andrew
Andrew!

312
00:24:34,990 --> 00:24:38,160
醒醒 太阳晒屁股了
Wake-up. Rise and shine.

313
00:24:38,280 --> 00:24:42,030
梦再甜 也不过一枕黄粱而已

623
00:59:24,190 --> 00:59:26,160
如果我带你到前面
If I take you to the front...

624
00:59:27,310 --> 00:59:28,690
你得把他杀了
you have to kill him.

625
00:59:29,190 --> 00:59:30,680
我会让你靠近他
I'll get you close enough.

00:59:31,030 --> 00:59:34,150
杀了他 放过我

我们还没走到一半呢
We're not even half way.

631

你已经走的比别人都要远了
You already go further than anyone else.

632
01:00:06,270 --> 01:00:09,020
比四年前的McGregor要远了
Rather than McGregor, 4 years ago.

633
01:00:10,400 --> 01:00:12,420
去不了引擎室的话
10 cars, 20 cars, it doesn't matter

634
01:00:12,420 --> 01:00:14,440
走的多远都没用
unless you make it to the engine.

635
01:00:14,940 --> 01:00:17,140
他们只会再次组织打压我们
They'll just regroup and attack us again.

636
01:00:17,140 --> 01:00:19,070
我们得阻止他们
We gotta pull them up at the routes.

637
01:00:19,950 --> 01:00:22,370
很多人牺牲了
So many have been killed.

638
01:00:24,520 --> 01:00:26,360
我们伤亡惨重
We've lost so many.

639
01:00:27,580 --> 01:00:28,630

他们伤痕累累
They are exhausted.

642
01:00:33,880 --> 01:00:36,380
我叫他们洗干净
I told them to wash themselves...

643
01:00:37,590 --> 01:00:39,800
我好去判断伤势
so I can assess the damage.

644
01:01:01,620 --> 01:01:03,040
让我去吧
Let me go ahead.

645
01:01:11,880 --> 01:01:14,790
我现在有了Mason 我能走的更快
I got Mason now, I can move a lot faster.

646
01:01:15,250 --> 01:01:17,920
你跟伤者留在这里 守着囚犯
You stay here with the wounded and guard the prisoners.

647
01:01:18,930 --> 01:01:21,430
我去夺取引擎室 然后让你做领袖
Let me take the Engine, I'll call for you to lead us.

648
01:01:23,010 --> 01:01:24,640
别这样 Curtis
Stop it, Curtis.

649
01:01:25,220 --> 01:01:27,090
你为什么要这样做
Why are you doing that?

650
01:01:29,190 --> 01:01:33,730
你很清楚你已经是领袖了
You know very well that you're already our leader.

651
01:01:35,400 --> 01:01:37,800
你必须接受这事
You have to accept that.

652
01:01:43,780 --> 01:01:46,280
两臂完好的人怎么当领袖
How can I lead if I have two good arms.

653
01:02:09,020 --> 01:02:11,110
印子淡了
It's faded out.

654
01:02:16,940 --> 01:02:19,070
两臂完整更好
Better to have both arms...

655
01:02:19,900 --> 01:02:22,650
很多事情是一只手做不了的
You can't do a lot with one, you know?

656
01:02:23,490 --> 01:02:25,620
特别是你带着个女人的时候
Especially when you hold a woman.

657
01:02:25,780 --> 01:02:28,730
两臂完整更好 不是吗
Much better to have two arms, won't you agree?

658
01:02:37,840 --> 01:02:40,260
当你到了窄桥
Well you get to the narrow bridge...

那有个写着W的门
big gate with a W on it.

660
01:02:46,140 --> 01:02:47,800
Wilford就在门后面
Wilford's behind that.

661
01:02:50,560 --> 01:02:52,520
别让他讲话
Don't let Wilford talk.

662
01:02:55,230 --> 01:02:56,770
切掉他的舌头
Cut out his tongue.

一个月后 我们吃了一个瘦个子

你知道我最讨厌自己的什么吗

他走上前说

906

"Give me the knife."

907
01:30:33,840 --> 01:30:36,390
大家都以为他要亲手杀那孩子
Everyone thought he'd killed the baby himself...

908
01:30:37,720 --> 01:30:39,180
但他接过刀
But he took the knife...

909
01:30:42,310 --> 01:30:43,980
砍掉自己的手

910
01:30:46,900 --> 01:30:48,570
说"吃这个吧"

911
01:30:48,690 --> 01:30:50,340
"你们那么饿的话"
"If you're so hungry..."

912
01:30:52,570 --> 01:30:55,700
"放过孩子 吃这个吧"
"Eat this, just leave the baby".

913
01:31:00,830 --> 01:31:02,960
我从来没看过这样的事

914
01:31:07,460 --> 01:31:09,550
那些人放下了刀
And the men put down their knives.

一个月之后 Wilford的人拿来那些蛋白质块

925
01:32:31,460 --> 01:32:33,590
我们从此之后就吃那垃圾

939
01:33:57,300 --> 01:34:00,260
大家都以为那是墙
Everyone thinks it's a wall.

940
01:34:01,390 --> 01:34:03,850
但那他妈的是一扇门
But it's a fucking door.

941
01:34:05,430 --> 01:34:09,460
开了这扇门 我们就能出去了
Open it and get us out of here.

942
01:34:09,810 --> 01:34:13,230
然后冻死吗 你疯了吗
And freeze to death? Are you crazy?

943
01:34:16,280 --> 01:34:18,360
我知道
I know...

944
01:34:19,990 --> 01:34:22,160
但说不定我们能生存呢
But maybe we can survive.

945
01:34:24,450 --> 01:34:26,990
你记得叶卡特琳娜桥吗
You remember Yekaterina bridge?

946
01:34:27,660 --> 01:34:30,580
我们被斧头砍时经过的桥
When we got slaughtered with an ax.

947
01:34:31,250 --> 01:34:35,470
每个新年 我都会去看些东西
Every new year, I check something.

948
01:34:35,590 --> 01:34:37,550
这次我们看到了雪下的
We see the wreckage of a plane...

949
01:34:37,710 --> 01:34:39,670
飞机残骸
under the snow.

950
01:34:42,050 --> 01:34:48,650
十年来 连机尾都看不到
For ten years the tail can barely seen.

951
01:34:48,770 --> 01:34:53,420
我现在却看到了机身的机翼
But now I can see the fuselage and wings.

952
01:34:55,560 --> 01:34:59,280
冰雪已经在减少
There is less and less snow and ice.

953
01:35:00,950 --> 01:35:02,280
在融化了
It melts.

954
01:35:03,660 --> 01:35:07,200
雪花变得脆弱了
Snow becomes more fragile,

955
01:35:07,660 --> 01:35:09,790
要逃离这些并不难
it doesn't take much to get rid of everything.

956
01:35:11,960 --> 01:35:13,460
最近
Recently,

957
01:35:15,210 --> 01:35:17,170
你知道我看到什么了吗
you know what I saw?

958
01:35:19,600 --> 01:35:21,800
我看到外面...
Outside, there was...

959
01:35:28,030 --> 01:35:29,560
算了
Drops.

960
01:35:30,310 --> 01:35:31,720
这不值一提
It is not worth telling it.

961
01:35:31,890 --> 01:35:33,980
你得把柯洛诺给戒了
You gotta take it easy on that Kronol.

962
01:35:34,230 --> 01:35:37,120
那玩意儿会把你脑子烧坏的
That bullshit is gonna fry your brain.

963
01:35:37,560 --> 01:35:39,520
你不信我
You don't think I'm right.

964
01:35:40,400 --> 01:35:42,490
柯洛诺是
Kronol is the first...

965
01:35:45,030 --> 01:35:48,000
最易燃的化学物
highly flammable chemical.

966
01:35:48,120 --> 01:35:49,720
一个火花就会爆炸
A spark and boom!

967
01:35:52,450 --> 01:35:55,160
基本上 那就是个炸弹
Basically, it's a fucking bomb.

968
01:36:00,570 --> 01:36:03,970
我留着不只是想嗨
I not only store these to get high,

969
01:36:04,580 --> 01:36:07,180
还想炸掉这门
but to blow that gate.

970
01:36:07,720 --> 01:36:08,890
火柴 快点
Matches, quickly.

971
01:36:09,220 --> 01:36:10,720
你在干什么
What are you doing?

972
01:36:11,350 --> 01:36:12,610
给我
Give it to me!

973
01:36:12,730 --> 01:36:13,970
炸掉那门
Take that off the door.

974
01:36:15,230 --> 01:36:16,230
火
Fire!

975
01:36:30,830 --> 01:36:32,400
Curtis Everett
Curtis Everett.

976
01:36:33,290 --> 01:36:36,060
我奉Wilford先生的命令来邀请您
I've been asked to extend a formal invitation...

977
01:36:36,180 --> 01:36:38,890
跟他共进晚餐
from Mr. Wilford to join him for dinner.

978
01:36:40,380 --> 01:36:41,940
你先走
After you.

979
01:37:09,490 --> 01:37:11,450
Curtis 是你吗
Curtis? Is that you?

980
01:37:14,450 --> 01:37:15,910
Curtis 好孩子
Curtis, dear boy.

981
01:37:16,330 --> 01:37:17,470
进来
Come in.

982
01:37:21,000 --> 01:37:22,880
让我看看你
Let's take a look at you.

983
01:37:23,340 --> 01:37:24,380
饿了吗
Are you hungry?

984
01:37:25,340 --> 01:37:28,220
你完成了一个男人的使命 一路奋进
You did a man's work, coming all this way.

985
01:37:30,050 --> 01:37:32,270
请坐
Please, sit down.

986
01:37:32,390 --> 01:37:34,030
你是第一个
You are the first human being

987
01:37:34,030 --> 01:37:36,630
走完整个列车的人
to have walked the total length of this train.

988
01:37:37,060 --> 01:37:38,350
从尾部到引擎
Tail to Engine.

989
01:37:38,730 --> 01:37:40,060
你知道吗
Did you know that?

990
01:37:40,650 --> 01:37:42,720
做得好 太赞了
Well done, bravo.

991
01:37:44,320 --> 01:37:48,460
你们没有一个人到过引擎室这里
None of your people have ever been here, to the Engine.

992
01:37:48,900 --> 01:37:50,910
我也没去过尾部
I've never been to the tail section.

993
01:37:51,160 --> 01:37:53,700
为什么 怕脏了您吗
Why not? Too dirty for you?

994
01:37:54,370 --> 01:37:56,650
不想跟臭虫子有身体接触吗
Don't want to rub against the vermin of the tail section?

995
01:37:57,250 --> 01:38:00,420
你以为我的车厢就没缺点吗
Do you think my station is without it's own drawbacks?

996
01:38:00,620 --> 01:38:01,960
很嘈
It's noisy.

997
01:38:02,920 --> 01:38:04,250
还很孤独
And it's lonely.

998
01:38:06,800 --> 01:38:07,800
对
Right.

999
01:38:08,760 --> 01:38:09,840
牛排
Steaks.

1000
01:38:10,340 --> 01:38:11,720
地方很大
Plenty of room.

1001
01:38:12,260 --> 01:38:14,530
你要什么 这婊子给你拿什么
This whore to bring you anything you want.

1002
01:38:15,140 --> 01:38:17,770
Curtis 每个人都有属于他的位置
Curtis, everyone has their preordained position.

1003
01:38:18,060 --> 01:38:20,350
而且每个人都处于他自己的位置 就除了你
And everyone is in their place except you.

1004
01:38:21,650 --> 01:38:23,830
这就是处于最优的人
That's what people in the best place

1005
01:38:23,830 --> 01:38:24,900
对处境最差的人说的话吗
say to the people in the worst place.

1006
01:38:26,730 --> 01:38:27,790
这车上没有人
There's not a soul on this

1007
01:38:27,790 --> 01:38:29,490
不想跟你交换位置
train that wouldn't trade places with you.

1008
01:38:29,820 --> 01:38:31,360
你要跟我交换吗
Would you trade places with me?

1009
01:38:31,660 --> 01:38:32,660
操你妈的
Fuck you.

1010
01:38:33,700 --> 01:38:35,200
Curtis 好孩子
Curtis, dear boy.

1011
01:38:35,370 --> 01:38:39,450
事实上我们都困在这鬼列车里
The fact is that we are all stuck inside this blasted train.

1012
01:38:39,660 --> 01:38:42,330
我们都是这铁皮箱里的囚犯
We are prisoners in this hunk of metal.

1013
01:38:42,460 --> 01:38:43,940
四分熟行吗
Medium rare?

1014
01:38:44,420 --> 01:38:46,840
这列车就是个封闭的生态系统
And this train is a close ecosystem.

1015
01:38:47,000 --> 01:38:49,340
我们不停的为了平衡而抗争
We must always strive for balance.

1016
01:38:50,170 --> 01:38:53,840
空气 水 食物 人口
Air, water, food supply, population.

1017
01:38:54,010 --> 01:38:55,680
都要控制好平衡
It must all be kept in balance.

1018
01:38:56,430 --> 01:38:59,750
为了达到最合适的平衡 总要用些
For optimum balance, however there'll have been time when more...

1019
01:38:59,870 --> 01:39:02,080
能治本的方法
radical solution would required.

1020
01:39:02,200 --> 01:39:05,860
当人口需要减少
When the population needed to be reduced, rather...

1021
01:39:06,520 --> 01:39:07,770
大大减少的时候
drastically.

1022
01:39:11,070 --> 01:39:14,110
我们没有时间等待物竞天择
We don't have time for true natural selection.

1023
01:39:14,740 --> 01:39:19,040
过密的人口与饥饿只会滋生彼此之间的仇恨与罪恶
We would all be hideously over crowded and starved waiting for that.

1024
01:39:21,000 --> 01:39:22,710
解决方法只有
The next best solution...

1025
01:39:23,750 --> 01:39:27,050
让一群人去杀另一群人
is to have individual units kill off other individual units.

1026
01:39:27,750 --> 01:39:31,470
每隔一段时间 我们就要搞一次类似的活动
From time to time, we've had to stir the pot, so to speak.

1027
01:39:31,590 --> 01:39:35,270
像是叛变的七子 McGregor Riots事件
The Revolt of Seven, The McGregor Riots...

1028
01:39:35,720 --> 01:39:38,010
至于伟大的Curtis起义
The Great Curtis Revolution.

1029
01:39:38,560 --> 01:39:42,730
这一轰动事件的结果可是出人意料
A blockbuster production with a devilishly unpredictable plot.

1030
01:39:43,100 --> 01:39:44,250
谁能预料到叶卡特琳娜的时候
Who could predicted your

1031
01:39:44,250 --> 01:39:46,350
你们会带着火把反击呢
counter attack with the torch at Yaketerina?

1032
01:39:47,940 --> 01:39:49,070
很聪明
Pure genius.

1033
01:39:50,110 --> 01:39:52,240
那可是Gilliam跟我都预料不到的
That wasn't what Gilliam and I had in our plan.

1034
01:39:52,360 --> 01:39:53,360
什么
What?

1035
01:39:56,370 --> 01:39:59,670
你该不会不知道吧 Gilliam跟我
Don't tell me you didn't know, Gilliam and I...

1036
01:39:59,790 --> 01:40:00,990
我们的计划
Our plan.

1037
01:40:02,790 --> 01:40:03,790
Gilliam
Gilliam?

1038
01:40:04,500 --> 01:40:05,500
Gilliam
Gilliam.

1039
01:40:06,170 --> 01:40:08,840
车头跟车尾合作才能前进
The front and the tail suppose to work together.

1040
01:40:09,460 --> 01:40:12,340
他不只是我的搭档 真的
He was more than a partner, really.

1041
01:40:13,490 --> 01:40:14,520
他还是我的朋友
He was my friend.

1042
01:40:14,640 --> 01:40:15,640
放屁
Bullshit.

1043
01:40:15,800 --> 01:40:17,050
我不相信你
I don't believe you.

1044
01:40:19,010 --> 01:40:20,450
我们原本的协议是
Our original agreement was

1045
01:40:20,450 --> 01:40:23,060
这起义在叶卡特琳娜隧道结束
for the insurgency to end at Yaketerina tunnel.

1046
01:40:23,230 --> 01:40:26,060
存活下来的人就回到尾部
And all the survivors will go back to the tail section...

1047
01:40:26,770 --> 01:40:29,770
- 享受比原来更大的空间  - 你说谎
- To enjoy a much more space. - You're a fucking liar.

1048
01:40:30,150 --> 01:40:31,570
Gilliam不会这样做的
Gilliam would never do that.

1049
01:40:32,400 --> 01:40:34,240
这计划屡试不爽
It all worked out in the end.

1050
01:40:34,490 --> 01:40:36,130
而你们的反击
Your counter attack actually

1051
01:40:36,130 --> 01:40:38,660
让这次起义变得刺激多了
made the insurgency 10 times more exciting.

1052
01:40:38,910 --> 01:40:40,380
不幸的是
Unfortunately the front

1053
01:40:40,380 --> 01:40:43,200
前车遭受的损失也严重多了
suffered more losses than anticipated and...

1054
01:40:43,790 --> 01:40:46,690
Gilliam要付出代价
Gilliam had to pay the price.

1055
01:40:49,540 --> 01:40:51,170
很讽刺 不是吗
Ironic, isn't it?

1056
01:40:51,550 --> 01:40:53,410
生与死
How people dramatically cross

1057
01:40:53,410 --> 01:40:56,170
只是一线之差
that thin barrier between life and death...

1058
01:40:56,880 --> 01:40:59,970
现在就剩下最后一步了
now there's just one last thing for us to do.

1059
01:41:02,510 --> 01:41:03,930
点算人数
Tally up the numbers.

1060
01:41:15,240 --> 01:41:17,400
你好 Wilford 是我
Hello Wilford, it's me.

1061
01:41:18,110 --> 01:41:19,740
我在Gilliam这里
I'm at Gilliam's place.

1062
01:41:20,070 --> 01:41:21,070
等下
Hold on.

1063
01:41:21,620 --> 01:41:23,580
人数没再变了吗
Is it still the same number?

1064
01:41:23,700 --> 01:41:26,330
对 还是百分之七十四
Yes, it still stands at 74%.

1065
01:41:26,450 --> 01:41:28,210
好的 继续
Okay, carry on.

1066
01:41:28,700 --> 01:41:29,960
等等
Wait.

1067
01:41:30,290 --> 01:41:33,790
留下十八个 庆祝十八周年
Spare 18, to celebrate our 18th year.

1068
01:41:33,910 --> 01:41:37,840
这主意太好了
It's an excellent idea.

1069
01:41:45,560 --> 01:41:46,630
都是你的人
Your people.

1070
01:41:47,820 --> 01:41:51,030
他妈的 Claude 小心引擎
Goddammit Claude. Mind the Engine!

1071
01:41:52,690 --> 01:41:54,860
她最近很敏感
She's getting sensitive recently.

1072
01:41:56,600 --> 01:41:58,780
坐下 有点礼貌
Sit down and mind your table manners.

1073
01:42:00,820 --> 01:42:01,910
别紧张
Relax.

1074
01:42:05,620 --> 01:42:07,240
冷静点
Calm down.

1075
01:42:09,530 --> 01:42:11,090
现在我明白Gilliam的意思了
Now I can see what Gilliam meant,

1076
01:42:11,090 --> 01:42:13,020
他说你很厉害很聪明
he told me you were brilliant and clever.

1077
01:42:13,140 --> 01:42:14,750
就是神经太紧张
But always so tense.

1078
01:42:16,130 --> 01:42:18,260
你上次做爱是什么时候了
When's the last time you got laid?

1079
01:42:20,130 --> 01:42:23,720
像Gilliam说的 抱着个女人最好有两只手
Like Gilliam said, holding a woman is much better with two arms.

1080
01:42:32,270 --> 01:42:33,650
我会怀念他的
I'll miss Gilliam.

1081
01:42:35,650 --> 01:42:37,940
我会怀念那些深夜里的电话聊天
I'll miss our late night phone chats.

1082
01:42:39,700 --> 01:42:41,900
他可以说好几个小时
He could go on for hours.

1083
01:42:42,530 --> 01:42:44,490
只用一只手而已
All with only one arm.

1084
01:42:46,200 --> 01:42:47,740
那脸是怎么回事
What's with that face?

1085
01:42:49,410 --> 01:42:50,710
你是怎么了
What's the matter?

1086
01:42:51,830 --> 01:42:53,870
你看着像疯子一样
You look like a crazy person.

1087
01:42:54,330 --> 01:42:56,500
这车上疯子已经够多了
As if there aren't enough crazies on this train.

1088
01:43:25,780 --> 01:43:26,860
血
Blood!

1089
01:43:30,040 --> 01:43:31,350
你没事吗
Are you okay?

1090
01:43:33,920 --> 01:43:36,210
什么 发生什么事
What? What happened?

1091
01:43:38,090 --> 01:43:39,390
趴下
Get down.

1092
01:43:55,440 --> 01:43:56,610
尤娜
Yona.

1093
01:43:56,730 --> 01:43:58,860
我们要开这个门
We must open this door.

1094
01:44:00,780 --> 01:44:03,610
看到那些线了吗
You see those cables?

1095
01:44:03,900 --> 01:44:05,220
这太多线了
There are so many cables.

1096
01:44:06,620 --> 01:44:07,620
死
Die!

1097
01:44:08,200 --> 01:44:09,410
混蛋
Bastard!

1098
01:44:10,120 --> 01:44:14,100
在这列车上 只有疯子
It is easier for someone to survive on this train...

1099
01:44:14,220 --> 01:44:16,500
才能更好的活着
if they have some level of insanity.

1100
01:44:18,340 --> 01:44:20,950
Gilliam很明白
As Gilliam well understood...

1101
01:44:21,070 --> 01:44:25,220
我们要维持紧张 惊慌
we need to maintain the proper balance of anxiety and fear...

1102
01:44:25,470 --> 01:44:28,870
混乱和恐惧的平衡才能活着
chaos and horror in order to keep life going.

1103
01:44:29,600 --> 01:44:34,160
如果没有这些的话 我们就要自己创造
If we don't have that, we need to invent it.

1104
01:44:34,940 --> 01:44:38,160
这方面 你带领的Curtis起义
In that sense, the Great Curtis revolution

1105
01:44:38,160 --> 01:44:39,540
可就是大师级的作品了

01:44:40,230 --> 01:44:41,230
尤娜
Yona.

1107
01:44:41,820 --> 01:44:43,230
红色 八号线
Red, number 8.

1108
01:44:43,440 --> 01:44:44,780
七号
No, 7.

1109
01:44:50,780 --> 01:44:52,240
跟我来 Curtis
Come with me, Curtis.

1110

我想给你看些东西
Something I want to show you.

你应得的
You deserve it.

1112
01:45:00,170 --> 01:45:01,170
来吧
Come on.

1113

她在苏醒了
She's waking up now.

很舒适 对吧
Cozy yes?

1115

平和
Peaceful.

1116
01:45:45,090 --> 01:45:47,210
现在你在她的心脏里
You are now in her heart.

1117
01:45:48,430 --> 01:45:51,690
我为这奉献了一生
I've devoted my entire life for this.

1118
01:45:52,800 --> 01:45:54,770
永动引擎
The Eternal Engine.

1119
01:45:57,020 --> 01:45:59,400
它自己运作 永不停止
It is the eternity itself.

1120
01:46:02,730 --> 01:46:05,360
你试过在这车上独处吗
Have you ever been alone on this train?

1121
01:46:06,740 --> 01:46:09,110
上一次你独处是什么时候了
When was the last time you were alone?

1122
01:46:10,570 --> 01:46:13,250
记不起来了 不是吗
You can't remember, can you?

1123
01:46:14,620 --> 01:46:16,540
那么请你
So please do.

1124
01:46:16,660 --> 01:46:18,340
慢慢享受
Take your time.

1125

我刚写的
I just wrote it.

1126
01:47:21,180 --> 01:47:22,970
为你写的 Curtis
It's for you, Curtis.

1127
01:47:23,980 --> 01:47:25,090
来
Here.

1128
01:47:37,960 --> 01:47:39,580
我老了
I am old.

1129
01:47:40,910 --> 01:47:43,320
我希望你接替我的位置
I want you to take my Station.

1130
01:47:44,580 --> 01:47:46,660
这是你一直梦想的事
It's what you've always wanted.

1131
01:47:50,590 --> 01:47:52,430
也是Gilliam梦想的事
It's what Gilliam wanted too.

1132
01:47:55,050 --> 01:47:56,970
你要照料这引擎
You must tend the Engine...

1133
01:47:57,930 --> 01:47:59,600
让她保持运转
Keep her humming.

1134
01:48:05,560 --> 01:48:06,850
听着 Curtis
Look, Curtis.

1135
01:48:08,190 --> 01:48:09,900
这门后面
Beyond the gate...

1136
01:48:11,610 --> 01:48:13,970
一个车厢接着一个车厢
Sections after sections precisely where they've

1137
01:48:13,990 --> 01:48:16,360
永远的在那里谨守岗位
always been and where they'll always be.

1138
01:48:16,530 --> 01:48:18,620
它们连起来成了什么
All adding up to what?

1139
01:48:20,540 --> 01:48:21,900
这列车
The train.

1140
01:48:24,330 --> 01:48:27,170
现在这完美的人口 大家都
And now the perfectly correct number of human beings...

1141
01:48:27,290 --> 01:48:30,880
处于自己的位置 这加起来是什么
All in their proper places, all adding up to what?

1142
01:48:31,460 --> 01:48:32,590
是全人类
Humanity.

1143
01:48:33,260 --> 01:48:35,090
这列车就是世界
The train is the world.

1144

我们就是全人类
We the humanity.

1145
01:48:40,100 --> 01:48:44,680
现在你有着带领全人类的神圣职责
And now you have the sacred responsibility to lead all humanity.

1146
01:48:45,310 --> 01:48:48,480
没有你的话 Curtis 人类会绝种的
Without you, Curtis, humanity will cease to exist.

1147
01:48:49,940 --> 01:48:52,850
你看过人们没有领袖的样子
You've seen what people do without leadership.

1148
01:48:53,490 --> 01:48:55,490
他们会吞噬其他人
They devour one another.

1149
01:49:18,090 --> 01:49:19,840
尤娜 柯洛诺
Yona, the Kronol!

1150
01:49:24,060 --> 01:49:26,050
尤娜 停 别
Yona, stop! No.

1151
01:49:28,660 --> 01:49:30,110
没子弹了吗
No bullets?

1152
01:49:37,070 --> 01:49:39,070
去拿柯洛诺
Get the Kronol then.

1153

看看他们

这就是他们的样子
That's how people are.

你看过的
You've seen this.

1157

你经历过的
You've been this.

1158
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:57,210
可笑又可悲 不是吗
Ridiculous. Pathetic, aren't they?

1159
01:49:58,260 --> 01:50:00,680
你能拯救他们
You can save them from themselves.

1160
01:50:02,140 --> 01:50:05,060
Gilliam拯救你就是为了这个
This is what Gilliam saved you for.

1161
01:50:11,020 --> 01:50:12,330

Curtis 火柴
Curtis, matches.

1165
01:50:27,790 --> 01:50:30,730
Curtis 火柴
Curtis! The match!

1166
01:51:03,990 --> 01:51:06,990
这地方只能容纳很小的人
The space only allows for a very small person.

1167
01:51:08,870 --> 01:51:11,030
五岁以下的小孩
Young children under 5.

1168
01:51:11,500 --> 01:51:15,880
虽然引擎是永动的 但不表示所有部件都不用替换

1169

最近那零件绝种了

1170

谢天谢地
Thank goodness

1172

尾部为我们源源不断的提供小孩
the tail section manufactured us a steady supplies of kids.

1173
01:51:29,270 --> 01:51:30,890
好让这能人力维持
So we can keep going manually.

1174
01:51:34,810 --> 01:51:36,360
操你妈的混蛋
Fucking bastard!

1175
01:51:59,920 --> 01:52:01,050
尤娜
Yona...

1176
01:52:03,720 --> 01:52:04,930
拿着火柴
Take the fire.

1177
01:52:23,070 --> 01:52:24,470
只剩一个了
Only one left.

1178

总引擎关闭

Do you remember me?

1184

别走上去 听着
Don't go up those stairs, listen.

Curtis 别那么狗血好吗
