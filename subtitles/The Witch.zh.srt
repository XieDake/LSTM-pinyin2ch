5
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:29,890
我向你们发誓
I swear to you,

6
00:01:29,930 --> 00:01:33,160
每一个被瘟疫带走的母亲和女儿
every single mother and daughter,

7
00:01:34,230 --> 00:01:37,830
父亲和儿子
father and son taken from us

8
00:01:37,870 --> 00:01:40,670
我都将替他们一一报仇
by the Black Plague will be avenged.

9
00:01:43,810 --> 00:01:46,040
是黑巫后
It is their Witch Queen

10
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:49,080
将诅咒降临在我们的大陆
who brought this curse upon our lands.

11
00:01:50,380 --> 00:01:53,350
只有她的死亡才能换来我们的救赎
And in her death lies our salvation.

12
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:00,320
要注意 兄弟们
Be warned, brothers.

13
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:02,720
在心脏停止跳动前
She will never truly perish

14
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:06,360
她永远不会真正死亡
until her heart beats its last.

15
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:08,730
我们要无所畏惧
Let fear be dead to us.

16
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:11,230
绝不能后退
There is no going back,

17
00:02:11,270 --> 00:02:14,140
因为我们已经无路可退
for there is nothing to go back to.

18
00:02:26,980 --> 00:02:29,450
那是什么 多兰?
What is it, Dolan?

19
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:38,230
毁灭巫师就在我们身边
The Hexen are amongst us.

20
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:44,070
这地方到处都是死亡的气息
This place reeks of death.

21
00:02:44,100 --> 00:02:45,470
时刻保持头脑冷静
Keep your wits about you.

22
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:47,440
跟紧一点
Stay close.

23
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:53,210
是她!
It's her!

24
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:55,210
是黑巫后!
It's the Queen!

25
00:03:05,020 --> 00:03:06,990
是魔法
The magic.

26
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:15,430
后退!
Stay back!

27
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:39,920
以钢铁和火焰之名!
By iron and fire!

28
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:44,030
救救我们!
Help us!

29
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:51,170
- 多兰! - 黑女巫!
- Dolan! - The Queen!

30
00:04:07,250 --> 00:04:08,980
天父啊
Heavenly Father,

31
00:04:09,020 --> 00:04:10,550
保佑我们远离这些魔鬼
protect us from these demons.

32
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:17,460
啊!
Ah!

33
00:04:22,230 --> 00:04:24,500
保持阵型 兄弟们!
Stay in formation, men!

34
00:04:44,190 --> 00:04:45,990
父亲!
Father!

35
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:47,960
父亲!
Father!

36
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:53,600
父亲 我好想你
Father, I missed you.

37
00:04:53,630 --> 00:04:55,230
你不是真的
You're not real.

38
00:04:55,260 --> 00:04:57,570
不可能是真的
You can't be.

39
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:34,000
你们像老鼠一样繁衍
You breed like rats.

40
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:35,500
你们住在用岩石堆垒
You put stone on top of stone

41
00:05:35,540 --> 00:05:38,040
建成的肮脏巢穴里
and then live in your own filth.

42
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:42,080
你们是我们世界的入侵者
You are trespassers on our world.

43
00:05:42,110 --> 00:05:45,980
因此我创造了瘟疫
This is why I created the Plague.

44
00:05:46,010 --> 00:05:50,320
你们每个人都必将毁灭
It's why every one of you must perish.

45
00:06:24,020 --> 00:06:26,720
啊!
Ah!

46
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:40,030
以钢铁
By iron

47
00:06:43,610 --> 00:06:45,410
和火焰之名
and fire.

48
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,040
你爱的每个人都离你而去
Everyone you love is gone.

49
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,550
我从你眼中就能看出来
I've seen it in your eyes.

50
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:53,380
你渴望死亡
You wish for death.

51
00:06:53,420 --> 00:06:55,550
今天我们将同归于尽
Today we both die.

52
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:13,800
我用我的生命诅咒你
I curse you with life.

53
00:07:15,140 --> 00:07:18,310
你将永世不得安宁
To never know peace.

54
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:23,780
你将孤独地走向世界的尽头
To walk the Earth alone for eternity.

55
00:07:27,420 --> 00:07:32,290
你将永远无法死亡
You will never die.

56
00:08:04,290 --> 00:08:06,320
谢谢
Thank you.

57
00:08:09,760 --> 00:08:11,830
打扰了 小姐?
Excuse me, miss?

58
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:14,200
先生 有什么事吗?
Sir, how can I help you?

59
00:08:42,190 --> 00:08:44,130
魔法
Magic.

60
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:25,700
嘿...
Hey...

61
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:27,940
小心点!
Watch it!

62
00:09:27,970 --> 00:09:30,570
抱歉 都是我的错
Sorry. Totally my fault.

63
00:09:32,610 --> 00:09:34,780
不好意思
Excuse me.

64
00:09:39,820 --> 00:09:40,780
你是巫师猎人
You're the witch hunter.

65
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:42,680
是的
Yeah.

66
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:43,950
我什么都没做
I didn't do anything.

67
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:45,450
给我看看
Let's see it.

68
00:09:45,490 --> 00:09:47,560
看什么?
See what?

69
00:09:47,590 --> 00:09:48,760
快点
Come on.

70
00:09:52,730 --> 00:09:53,760
女士们先生们
Ladies and gentlemen,

71
00:09:53,800 --> 00:09:55,300
机长已经开启...
the Captain has turned on...

72
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:57,770
幸亏你没把它们弄湿
Be glad you didn't get them wet.

73
00:10:00,370 --> 00:10:02,700
我找这东西有一阵子了
I've been looking for these for a while.

74
00:10:02,740 --> 00:10:04,910
这些都是古代符文
These are ancient runes.

75
00:10:04,940 --> 00:10:06,610
可以操纵天气
They can manipulate weather.

76
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:09,480
雨 风 寒 炎...
Rain, wind, cold, heat...

77
00:10:09,510 --> 00:10:12,580
而你就这么把它们一起塞在包里?
And you just jammed them together in your bag?

78
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:14,220
你知道当你把暴风雨符文和湿气符文
You know what you get when you mix a thunderstorm

79
00:10:14,250 --> 00:10:16,350
在40000英尺的高空混合起来后会得到什么吗?
with cool, moist air at 40,000 feet?

80
00:10:18,820 --> 00:10:20,560
这是很简单的科学道理
It's simple science.

81
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:29,460
简直难以置信
Unbelievable.

82
00:10:29,500 --> 00:10:33,200
你们这些巫师都不知道自己有着怎样的力量
You witches have no idea the power you've got.

83
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:23,650
哦 天啊
Oh, my God.

84
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:27,690
你要把我送到巫师委员会去吗?
Are you gonna turn me over to the Witch Council?

85
00:11:27,720 --> 00:11:29,360
不
No.

86
00:11:29,390 --> 00:11:30,990
那你会杀了我吗?
You're gonna kill me?

87
00:11:31,030 --> 00:11:33,660
杀你?
Kill you?

88
00:11:33,700 --> 00:11:36,530
我是在阻止你杀了你自己
I'm tryin' to stop you from killing yourself.

89
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:40,700
祝你在纽约玩儿得开心
Enjoy New York.

90
00:11:43,000 --> 00:11:45,310
先生 "请系好安全带"的标志亮了
Sir, "Fasten seatbelts" signs are on.

91
00:11:45,340 --> 00:11:46,310
你得回到座位上去
I need you to take a seat.

92
00:11:46,340 --> 00:11:48,310
我叫卡尔德
My name is Kaulder.

93
00:11:49,580 --> 00:11:51,810
请您回到座位上 卡尔德
I need you to get back to your seat, Kaulder.

94
00:11:51,850 --> 00:11:54,520
我很想听听你小时候在塞夫鲁的经历
I'd love to hear about growing up in Sefrou.

95
00:11:56,820 --> 00:11:58,750
你怎么知道的?
How'd you know?

96
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:00,760
我已经很多年说话没有口音了
Haven't had an accent in years.

97
00:12:00,790 --> 00:12:03,860
我这辈子见过很多的人
I've met a lot of people in my life.

98
00:12:03,890 --> 00:12:06,300
一定会让你大吃一惊的
You'd be amazed what you pick up.

99
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:12,670
巫师们秘密地生活在人群之中
Witches live among us in secret.

100
00:12:12,700 --> 00:12:15,870
他们的魔力继承自原始种族
Their magic passed down from an ancient race,

101
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:19,870
已逐渐淡化 遗忘 但是仍然危险而强大
diluted, half-forgotten, but dangerously powerful.

102
00:12:20,910 --> 00:12:24,580
经过几个世纪的冲突 巫师与人类之间达成了休战协议
After centuries of conflict, a truce was forged.

103
00:12:24,610 --> 00:12:26,350
人类允许巫师
Witches would be allowed to live

104
00:12:26,380 --> 00:12:28,120
在世间生存 自治
and govern themselves if they followed

105
00:12:28,150 --> 00:12:34,020
前提是他们严格遵守规定 永远不对人类使用魔法
one strict rule, that magic never be used against humans.

106
00:12:34,060 --> 00:12:36,520
但休战协议是个脆弱的东西
But a truce is a fragile thing.

107
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:37,590
有些女巫渴望着
There are some who long for

108
00:12:37,630 --> 00:12:40,860
重拾曾经的生活
the return of the old ways,

109
00:12:40,900 --> 00:12:43,600
被黑巫后统治的黑暗时代
the dark days of the Witch Queen.

110
00:12:43,630 --> 00:12:47,000
卡尔德需要解决的就是这些女巫
It is those whom Kaulder deals with.

111
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:52,010
800年以来 他效命于十字斧教
For 800 years, he has served The Axe and Cross.

112
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:57,010
与我们共同看守女巫 保护和平
Together we have kept watch and kept the peace.

113
00:13:08,060 --> 00:13:10,020
呃 很抱歉 多兰神父 他在开会
Uh, I'm sorry, Father Dolan. He's in a meeting.

114
00:13:10,060 --> 00:13:11,990
哦
Oh.

115
00:13:22,840 --> 00:13:26,010
会议已经结束了
The meeting has concluded.

116
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:27,510
我以一种截然不同的方式
I serve The Axe and Cross

117
00:13:27,540 --> 00:13:29,040
效命于十字斧教
in a very different manner.

118
00:13:29,080 --> 00:13:33,450
我是第36代多兰 我书写卡尔德的历史
I am the 36th Dolan, and I write Kaulder's history.

119
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,680
我是他的管理者 他的倾听者
I am his handler, his confessor,

120
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:37,420
我也乐于认为 自己是他的朋友
and, I like to think, his friend.

121
00:13:37,450 --> 00:13:40,190
你完全没有时间观念
You have no sense of time.

122
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:43,660
我当然有 只不过跟你的不一样
Course I do. It's just different than yours.

123
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:46,590
我猜你的任务很成功?
I assume your mission was a success?

124
00:13:46,630 --> 00:13:49,530
你平安无事地找到了天气符文?
You recovered the weather runes without incident?

125
00:13:49,570 --> 00:13:51,870
我给你的iPad哪去了?
What happened to the iPad I gave you?

126
00:13:51,900 --> 00:13:53,970
借花献佛了
I re-gifted it.

127
00:13:54,000 --> 00:13:55,870
我们不像你那么适应现代科技
We're not all as adaptable as you.

128
00:13:55,900 --> 00:13:57,570
你知道纸张已经过时了吧
You know paper's the past.

129
00:13:57,610 --> 00:14:00,470
它还是非常有用的记录工具
It's also a useful object on which to record it.

130
00:14:02,710 --> 00:14:05,680
你是在回忆路德维希事件吗?
Are you reminiscing about the Ludwig affair?

131
00:14:05,710 --> 00:14:08,420
我现在伤感着呢
I'm in a sentimental mood.

132
00:14:09,890 --> 00:14:11,850
啊
Ah.

133
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:13,890
因为我的退休?
About my retirement?

134
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,820
所以你回来了
That's why you've come back.

135
00:14:15,860 --> 00:14:17,930
我们一直配合得很好
We have had a good run.

136
00:14:17,960 --> 00:14:20,490
我们解决了许多邪恶的女巫集会
We took out some nasty covens.

137
00:14:20,530 --> 00:14:22,600
你真的准备不干了吗?
You're really ready to call it quits?

138
00:14:22,630 --> 00:14:24,000
区区50年而已
It's only been 50 years.

139
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:25,800
我好不容易习惯了你
I'm finally getting used to you.

140
00:14:25,830 --> 00:14:27,070
哦 这就是全部原因?
Oh. Is that all it took?

141
00:14:29,870 --> 00:14:31,970
我会想你的 孩子
I'll miss you, kid.

142
00:14:34,580 --> 00:14:36,510
这是支华特曼402钢笔
This is a Waterman 402.

143
00:14:36,550 --> 00:14:37,850
我在上面刻了你的名字缩写
I had your initials engraved on it.

144
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,510
这笔非常稀少
It's very rare.

145
00:14:39,550 --> 00:14:41,150
刻过字后价值恐怕大大缩水了
Probably lowered the value quite a bit.

146
00:14:41,180 --> 00:14:43,120
对我来说可不是
Not to me.

147
00:14:45,990 --> 00:14:49,020
你再好好考虑一下 笔就是你的
You reconsider, you can still keep the pen.

148
00:14:49,060 --> 00:14:51,090
我想你会喜欢我的接班人的
I think you'll like my successor.

149
00:14:51,130 --> 00:14:53,590
我准备用现代点的方法离开你
I'm leaving you in more modern hands.

150
00:14:53,630 --> 00:14:55,560
你曾经说过的誓约呢?
What about the vow you took?

151
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:59,730
我的誓约是在你身边直至死亡
I vowed to face death at your side.

152
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:02,570
而不是工作到挂掉
Not to work until I keel over.

153
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:05,140
第35代多兰在你之前来过这里
Thirty-five Dolans have come before you.

154
00:15:06,870 --> 00:15:08,510
这杯敬唯一能让我
Here's to the only one

155
00:15:08,540 --> 00:15:09,840
听取建议的人
whose advice I ever listened to.

156
00:15:09,880 --> 00:15:12,110
虽然你从来不肯照办
Only to ignore it.

157
00:15:13,610 --> 00:15:15,720
但我永远都会听的
But I always listen.

158
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:17,520
如果你也退休了呢?
What if you were retiring, too?

159
00:15:18,990 --> 00:15:20,790
我是说 如果你的下个任务
I mean, what would you do

160
00:15:20,820 --> 00:15:22,590
就是最后一个任务你会怎么办?
if your next mission was your last?

161
00:15:22,620 --> 00:15:23,690
不可能的
But it won't be.

162
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:25,030
配合我一下
Humor me.

163
00:15:25,060 --> 00:15:27,730
我一直毫无怨言
I have no complaints.

164
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:29,030
每天我醒来
Every day I wake up,

165
00:15:29,060 --> 00:15:30,670
这个世界都会更轻松地睡去
the world sleeps a little easier.

166
00:15:30,700 --> 00:15:33,030
卡尔德 你经历过
Kaulder, you have tasted more of life

167
00:15:33,070 --> 00:15:35,270
我无法想象的长久人生
than I can ever imagine,

168
00:15:35,300 --> 00:15:39,310
但是你已经很久没有真正的活过了
but it's been a long time since you really lived.

169
00:15:39,340 --> 00:15:41,740
你享受不到我们短暂的生命中
You're missing out on the best part

170
00:15:41,780 --> 00:15:44,180
最美好的那一部分
of our brief stay in this world.

171
00:15:44,210 --> 00:15:47,050
和人分享的那一部分
The part where you share it.

172
00:15:47,080 --> 00:15:50,050
找个信任的人吧
Find someone to trust.

173
00:15:51,850 --> 00:15:53,820
我信任你
I trust you.

174
00:15:53,850 --> 00:15:55,860
可能要再找个清秀一点儿的
Perhaps someone a little more comely.

175
00:15:57,090 --> 00:15:59,760
我知道 我并不像你一样
I know, I haven't lived

176
00:15:59,800 --> 00:16:01,560
拥有悠久而丰富的人生
as long and rich a life as you,

177
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:03,230
但我同样清楚 人生的意义远不止
but I do know that there is more to it

178
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:05,570
欣赏一群空姐
than a parade of stewardesses

179
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:09,200
和着月光鸣奏曲进行游行
marching to the dulcet tones of Moonlight Sonata.

180
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,640
你到底是怎么知道
Now what in the world do you know

181
00:16:12,670 --> 00:16:14,980
空姐的事儿的?
about stewardesses anyway?

182
00:16:15,010 --> 00:16:16,640
我又不是生来就是神父
I wasn't born a priest.

183
00:16:18,650 --> 00:16:21,280
我们来干点活吧
Let's do some work.

184
00:16:21,320 --> 00:16:22,820
我知道你觉得这很无聊
I know you think it's dull,

185
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:25,650
不过我们还是得从头开始
but let's start at the beginning.

186
00:16:48,010 --> 00:16:50,240
虽然是不言而喻的事
It goes without saying,

187
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:53,010
但您效力的方式真是与众不同
but you've served with great distinction.

188
00:16:53,050 --> 00:16:55,280
冒昧一问 我明天见卡尔德的时候
If I may, when I meet Kaulder tomorrow,

189
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:57,190
需要冷静一点 是吗?
I should play it cool, right?

190
00:16:57,220 --> 00:16:59,320
仪式完毕再去喝咖啡之类的
No coffee until after the ritual.

191
00:16:59,350 --> 00:17:01,090
别担心什么风度了
Don't worry about your style.

192
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:02,990
反正无论如何他都会嘲讽你的
He'll take the piss out of you anyway.

193
00:17:03,030 --> 00:17:04,960
但你会没事的
But you'll be fine.

194
00:17:06,030 --> 00:17:10,860
只是 呃 我担心的是卡尔德
It's, uh, Kaulder that I worry about.

195
00:17:10,900 --> 00:17:12,700
你担心卡尔德?
You worry about Kaulder?

196
00:17:12,730 --> 00:17:14,170
你知道十字斧教的前辈们
Do you know how the elders

197
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,270
是如何看待他的吗?
of The Axe and Cross refer to him?

198
00:17:16,300 --> 00:17:17,640
他们称他为 "秘密武器"
They call him "The Weapon."

199
00:17:17,670 --> 00:17:18,870
当我提交报告时
When I put in my reports,

200
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:20,340
他们所关心的只有数字
all they want to know is numbers.

201
00:17:20,380 --> 00:17:22,780
我移交了多少女巫
How many witches I've turned over for detention.

202
00:17:22,810 --> 00:17:24,850
又有多少女巫因为违反法律被处死
How many slain for breaking the law.

203
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:27,720
这能怪他们吗? 他所做的事情是如此的重要
Can you blame them? What he does is so important.

204
00:17:27,750 --> 00:17:32,090
是的 的确很重要 但他不仅仅是个武器
Yes, that's true, but he isn't just a weapon.

205
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:34,760
而我们这些知道真相的人
And those of us who know the truth,

206
00:17:34,790 --> 00:17:37,060
必将肩负重任
we bear responsibility.

207
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:42,900
无论发生什么 发誓你会看好他
Whatever happens, promise me you'll watch out for him.

208
00:17:42,930 --> 00:17:46,300
当然 这是我的工作
Of course. That's my job.

209
00:17:54,710 --> 00:17:56,650
出租车!
Taxi!

210
00:18:38,450 --> 00:18:40,020
你好?
Hello?

211
00:18:40,050 --> 00:18:41,820
卡尔德先生吗?
Kaulder?

212
00:18:41,860 --> 00:18:44,890
第36代多兰昨晚走的很安详
Dolan the 36th passed away peacefully last night.

213
00:18:44,930 --> 00:18:46,960
仪式将在明天举行
The ceremony will be tomorrow.

214
00:18:48,530 --> 00:18:50,960
对此我感到很遗憾
I'm sorry for your loss.

215
00:18:53,400 --> 00:18:56,400
在你之前已有三十六任"多兰"了
Thirty-six have taken the name "Dolan" before you.

216
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:59,340
你是否有资格成为合格的第三十七任?
Are you worthy of becoming the 37th?

217
00:18:59,370 --> 00:19:01,410
我会用行动证明的
I testify that I am.

218
00:19:01,440 --> 00:19:02,980
你会发誓全力
Do you promise to serve

219
00:19:03,010 --> 00:19:05,210
协助卡尔德吗?
our brother Kaulder in all things?

220
00:19:05,250 --> 00:19:10,050
你愿意成为他的知己吗?
To know him only as he knows himself?

221
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:12,220
我发誓
I promise.

222
00:19:43,290 --> 00:19:45,390
你就是那个新人
So you're the new guy.

223
00:19:46,650 --> 00:19:49,420
其实我们之前见过
We've actually met before.

224
00:19:50,530 --> 00:19:52,990
很早以前
A long time ago.

225
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:57,260
你瞧见那些基石了吗?
You see that cornerstone?

226
00:19:59,130 --> 00:20:00,530
我看着它们在玉米地上
I watched them lay it in

227
00:20:00,570 --> 00:20:03,970
一点点地砌筑起来
when this was nothing more than a cornfield.

228
00:20:04,010 --> 00:20:06,870
那才叫很早以前
That was a long time ago.

229
00:20:09,110 --> 00:20:13,400
作为第三十七任多兰 我将自己的生命与忠诚交于你
I pledge my life and loyalty to you as the 37th Dolan.

230
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:16,320
我发誓助你完成组织赋予你的使命...
I swear to help you carry out your duty to the Order...

231
00:20:16,350 --> 00:20:18,490
他们建造这座城市时
When they were building this city,

232
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,590
建筑工人在十八米深的地方
construction crews discovered

233
00:20:20,620 --> 00:20:24,930
发现了一座巨大的墓地
a mass gravesite, 60 feet below ground,

234
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:27,990
那个被遗忘的角落堆满了几千具奴隶尸体
filled with thousands of forgotten slaves.

235
00:20:28,030 --> 00:20:30,260
知道他们怎么处理的吗?
Know what they did?

236
00:20:30,300 --> 00:20:32,030
不知道
No.

237
00:20:33,970 --> 00:20:35,140
日夜赶工 填平墓地
Worked by night, filled the hole,

238
00:20:35,170 --> 00:20:36,900
继续建造
and kept building.

239
00:20:38,210 --> 00:20:40,980
邪恶无所不在
There are shades of evil everywhere.

240
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:48,580
我为你准备了
So, I'm sorting you out with

241
00:20:48,620 --> 00:20:51,150
新的信用卡 护照 还有身份证
fresh credit cards, new passport, and a new identity.

242
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:52,350
我已经习惯用旧的了
Just gettin' used to the old one.

243
00:20:52,390 --> 00:20:54,060
但它们都过期了
Well, it's out of date.

244
00:20:54,090 --> 00:20:56,420
如今的电视台 手机和定位系统
There are global databases now, CCTV's,

245
00:20:56,460 --> 00:20:58,990
都使用全球联网数据库了 世界正在改变
smartphones and geotracking. The world is changing.

246
00:20:59,030 --> 00:21:00,990
只是表面上的改变而已
Only on the surface.

247
00:21:01,030 --> 00:21:03,500
这么说也没错 不过还是要低调点
Right. But it's important to keep a low profile.

248
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:08,740
幸亏这辆车不是红色的
I guess we should be thankful it's not red.

249
00:21:08,770 --> 00:21:10,700
我能问问要去哪里吗?
May I ask where we're going?

250
00:21:10,740 --> 00:21:14,340
我虽然见过别人衰老 退休 去世
I've seen people get old, retire, and die.

251
00:21:14,380 --> 00:21:16,680
但是罕有都在同一天的
Rarely on the same day.

252
00:21:21,420 --> 00:21:24,150
他死在桌子前
He was found at his desk.

253
00:21:36,430 --> 00:21:38,470
我们要找什么?
What are we looking for?

254
00:21:38,500 --> 00:21:42,040
如何知道这附近是否使用过魔法?
How do you know when there's magic in the vicinity?

255
00:21:42,070 --> 00:21:44,340
巫师的魔法来自四种元素
A witch's magic comes from four elements,

256
00:21:44,370 --> 00:21:46,070
火 水 土 气
fire, water, earth and air.

257
00:21:46,110 --> 00:21:47,510
只要用恰当的炼金术触发
Applying the correct alchemical triggers

258
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:49,480
就能让这些元素显现
will reveal its presence.

259
00:22:04,090 --> 00:22:05,390
这里没有魔法
No magic here.

260
00:22:05,430 --> 00:22:07,530
我只想确认一下
Just wanted to be sure.

261
00:22:15,200 --> 00:22:16,470
如果窗户始终是关着的话
If the window hasn't been opened,

262
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:20,140
这些东西是怎么进来的?
how did that get in here?

263
00:22:20,180 --> 00:22:21,810
只有一个 也许没事
One means nothing.

264
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:24,550
只有两个 那也可能是巧合
Two, a coincidence.

265
00:22:24,580 --> 00:22:28,020
如果有三个 就是大大的麻烦了
Three, trouble.

266
00:22:46,600 --> 00:22:48,540
趴下!
Get down!

267
00:23:00,610 --> 00:23:02,550
怎么回事?
What?

268
00:23:04,650 --> 00:23:06,150
他是被巫师杀害的
He was killed by witches.

269
00:23:06,190 --> 00:23:07,620
十字斧教的历代多兰
Never in the history of The Axe and Cross

270
00:23:07,650 --> 00:23:09,620
没有一任是被谋杀的
has a Dolan ever been murdered.

271
00:23:10,690 --> 00:23:12,330
你想退出了?
You wanna quit?

272
00:23:12,360 --> 00:23:14,460
不想
No.

273
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:16,860
我要加薪
I want a raise.

274
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:18,200
这是在宣战
This is a declaration of war.

275
00:23:18,230 --> 00:23:19,700
谁会这么做?
Who could have done this?

276
00:23:19,730 --> 00:23:21,500
他们使用了隐匿咒
A concealment spell was placed

277
00:23:21,540 --> 00:23:23,270
好让一切看起来正常
to make everything look normal.

278
00:23:23,300 --> 00:23:24,640
他们在找一样东西
They were searching for something,

279
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:26,610
但不想被我们发现
didn't want us to know.

280
00:23:28,610 --> 00:23:31,210
元素魔法是中性的
Elemental magic is neutral.

281
00:23:32,380 --> 00:23:35,780
追根究底 它并没有好坏之分
At its root it's neither good nor evil.

282
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:40,860
但这个不同
But this is different.

283
00:23:40,890 --> 00:23:43,160
这是黑魔法
This is dark magic.

284
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:45,390
非常邪恶
Beyond evil.

285
00:23:49,300 --> 00:23:51,630
他们把他绑在椅子上
They tied him to the chair.

286
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:05,480
"死亡"
"Death."

287
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:08,150
那是咒语的一部分吗?
Is that part of the spell?

288
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:11,550
昨晚 在他死之前你也在这里 对吗?
You were here last night before he died, right?

289
00:24:11,590 --> 00:24:13,520
对
Yes.

290
00:24:16,420 --> 00:24:18,830
让我看看你的手
Let me see your hands.

291
00:24:20,460 --> 00:24:22,400
马上
Now.

292
00:24:30,740 --> 00:24:32,840
在我五岁时
I was five years old

293
00:24:32,870 --> 00:24:35,510
巫师放火烧了我的家
when witches set our house on fire.

294
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:37,210
我父母死了
My parents died.

295
00:24:37,250 --> 00:24:38,280
是你走过火焰
But you walked through the flames,

296
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:39,610
把我裹在毯子里
wrapped me in a blanket,

297
00:24:39,650 --> 00:24:41,920
跳出了二楼窗户
and jumped out the second story window.

298
00:24:41,950 --> 00:24:43,880
坠落时 你用身体护住了我
Your body broke the fall.

299
00:24:44,950 --> 00:24:47,390
我说了之前我们见过
I told you we'd met before.

300
00:24:49,460 --> 00:24:50,760
如果你忘了 我再告诉你一些细节...
If you don't remember, I can refer you to the entry...

301
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:54,600
我没忘
No. I remember.

302
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:00,700
你追捕那些巫师 将他们绳之以法
You hunted down the witches and brought them to justice.

303
00:25:02,670 --> 00:25:06,210
我一直在等待一个帮助你的机会
I've waited my entire life for the opportunity to help you.

304
00:25:09,540 --> 00:25:11,480
这就是你的机会
Well, now's your chance.

305
00:25:13,250 --> 00:25:15,880
帮我找出真凶
You can help me hunt the witches that did this.

306
00:25:19,790 --> 00:25:22,720
我不该带把枪或者铁槌什么的?
Shouldn't I have a gun or an iron mallet or something?

307
00:25:24,290 --> 00:25:26,530
深呼吸 放松点
Take a deep breath. Center yourself.

308
00:25:26,560 --> 00:25:28,400
当然
Right. Of course.

309
00:25:28,430 --> 00:25:30,230
因为头脑清醒才能抵抗魔法
Because resisting enchantment requires a clear mind.

310
00:25:30,270 --> 00:25:32,270
听我说 麦克斯是一个十四级的男巫
Now, Max is a 14th level warlock,

311
00:25:32,300 --> 00:25:34,600
你抵抗不了的 还不如放轻松
there's nothing you can do. May as well relax.

312
00:25:38,910 --> 00:25:40,240
神父 要尝尝样品吗?
Free sample, Father?

313
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:42,680
谢谢
Oh. Thank you.

314
00:25:42,710 --> 00:25:44,640
如果是我 就不会轻易下嘴
I'd think twice about that.

315
00:25:50,750 --> 00:25:52,490
我没想到能赚一万美金
I don't know that I can do $10,000.

316
00:25:52,520 --> 00:25:53,820
你很清楚这些虫子
You know the level of enchantment

317
00:25:53,850 --> 00:25:55,460
能对他们造成多大的影响
they are getting from that.

318
00:25:55,490 --> 00:25:56,690
生意不错吧?
Business is good, right?

319
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:58,590
是的
Yeah.

320
00:25:58,630 --> 00:25:59,760
见鬼
Oh, crap.

321
00:25:59,790 --> 00:26:01,800
关门了 麦克斯
Shop's closed, Max.

322
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:17,040
卡尔德 好久不见了
Kaulder. It has been too long.

323
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:19,850
贩卖致幻虫也不犯法吧
It is not illegal to sell mind-altering bugs.

324
00:26:19,880 --> 00:26:21,950
如果用在人身上 就算犯法了
When they're used on humans, it is.

325
00:26:21,980 --> 00:26:22,980
他们把虫子掺进了杯形蛋糕里
They're mixing them in the cupcakes.

326
00:26:23,020 --> 00:26:25,050
我看不到
I hadn't noticed.

327
00:26:25,090 --> 00:26:27,020
那这个呢?
Notice this?

328
00:26:29,060 --> 00:26:32,590
格里芬天仙子 极其罕见并且禁止使用
Griffin's Henbane. Very rare and forbidden.

329
00:26:32,630 --> 00:26:35,630
这是在巫术中使用的 黑魔法
This is used in necromancy. Dark magic.

330
00:26:35,660 --> 00:26:38,830
你知道我不卖这种邪恶的东西
You know I do not deal in these kinds of bad things.

331
00:26:38,870 --> 00:26:42,800
麦克斯 你总不至于犯这种蠢吧
Max, you're too smart to go down that road.

332
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:45,810
我听过的谎言多到令人难以想象
One can only imagine how many times I've been lied to.

333
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,070
比史上任何人听过的都多
More than anyone in history, actually.

334
00:26:47,110 --> 00:26:49,380
拜托 卡尔德
Come on, Kaulder.

335
00:26:49,410 --> 00:26:51,810
你必须明白 任何人只要敢用这种草
You must understand, anyone who would use this herb

336
00:26:51,850 --> 00:26:54,850
就不会怕你 而这一点吓到我了!
is not afraid of you. And that scares me!

337
00:26:54,880 --> 00:26:58,320
你怕这个 却不怕我?
More than I scare you?

338
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:00,420
麦克斯
Max.

339
00:27:02,690 --> 00:27:05,930
那个来找我的人皮肤上有种气味
The man who came to see me has an odor on his skin.

340
00:27:05,960 --> 00:27:07,990
闻起来像大蒜 却又不是
A whiff of garlic that was not garlic.

341
00:27:08,030 --> 00:27:11,560
砒霜 还有吗?
Arsenic. Anything else?

342
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:15,070
腐烂的山楂味
And moldering crabapples.

343
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:18,810
多谢 麦克斯
Thank you, Max.

344
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:20,040
小心点
Be careful.

345
00:27:20,070 --> 00:27:21,080
没那个习惯
Not in the habit.

346
00:27:21,110 --> 00:27:23,610
不是你 是他
Not you. Him.

347
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:30,380
所以 你听懂了吗?
So, all that made sense to you?

348
00:27:30,420 --> 00:27:32,390
你不懂吗?
It didn't to you?

349
00:27:32,420 --> 00:27:35,090
不懂
No.

350
00:27:35,120 --> 00:27:38,560
在内战时期 砒霜被用在尸体防腐上
Arsenic was used for embalming back in the Civil War.

351
00:27:38,590 --> 00:27:40,760
谋杀多兰的那个人
Whoever killed Dolan

352
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:43,830
很可能住在一个曾经是殡仪馆的地方
is likely living in what was once a funeral parlor.

353
00:27:44,930 --> 00:27:47,740
我们只要找周围有山楂树的就行了
We just have to find one with a crabapple tree.

354
00:27:50,400 --> 00:27:52,370
这是干嘛?
What's that for?

355
00:27:52,410 --> 00:27:54,710
自己打车走
A cab.

356
00:27:54,740 --> 00:27:57,110
接下来的事情你应付不了
You're not qualified for what happens next.

357
00:27:57,140 --> 00:27:58,610
哦
Oh.

358
00:27:58,650 --> 00:28:01,750
好的 我会拿小票的
Right. I'll get a receipt.

359
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:40,720
哇哦
Whoa.

360
00:29:01,140 --> 00:29:05,010
你妈妈没教你不要吃树上的糖果吗?
Didn't your mother ever teach you not to eat candy from trees?

361
00:29:12,690 --> 00:29:14,620
快回家 孩子
Go home, kid.

362
00:30:01,940 --> 00:30:04,810
走开
Go away.

363
00:30:04,840 --> 00:30:06,070
没事的
It's okay.

364
00:30:06,110 --> 00:30:08,040
- 离我远点 - 嘘
- Get away from me. - Shh.

365
00:30:09,840 --> 00:30:11,040
没事的
It's okay.

366
00:30:11,080 --> 00:30:12,880
别再靠近了
Get away from me now.

367
00:30:12,910 --> 00:30:15,180
- 我不会伤害你的 - 走开!
- I'm not gonna hurt you. - Go away!

368
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:18,750
没事的
It's okay.

369
00:30:29,300 --> 00:30:31,230
该死
Oh, shit.

370
00:30:41,680 --> 00:30:43,780
你为什么要杀多兰?
You killed Dolan. Why?

371
00:30:43,810 --> 00:30:45,810
谁他妈的是多兰? 哈?
Who the bloody hell's Dolan? Huh?

372
00:30:45,850 --> 00:30:47,110
我这辈子都没见过!
I never met the man in my life!

373
00:30:52,950 --> 00:30:55,660
喜欢我的新钢笔吗? 哈?
Do you like my new pen? Huh?

374
00:31:16,210 --> 00:31:17,910
我想象过自己第一次在
When I imagined my first prosecution

375
00:31:17,950 --> 00:31:19,110
委员会前起诉的场景
in front of the Council,

376
00:31:19,150 --> 00:31:20,310
可我从未想过
I never thought it would be

377
00:31:20,350 --> 00:31:22,350
死者会是自己人
for a crime against one of our own.

378
00:31:23,780 --> 00:31:24,780
埃里克·拉马斯内尔
Ellic Lemasniel.

379
00:31:24,820 --> 00:31:26,950
你好啊 神父 呜呼!
Hello, Father. Whoo!

380
00:31:26,990 --> 00:31:28,690
你看起来是个好人
You look like a good man,

381
00:31:28,720 --> 00:31:31,590
故作高雅的小人 我从没去过...
tasty little thing, you. I never went...

382
00:31:32,860 --> 00:31:34,990
请别因此看轻我
Please don't think less of me.

383
00:31:40,740 --> 00:31:42,840
过后我会忏悔的
I'll confess it later.

384
00:32:01,890 --> 00:32:03,860
巫师委员会在此恭候
The Witch Council receives you,

385
00:32:03,890 --> 00:32:06,690
十字斧教的第三十七任多兰
37th Dolan of The Axe and Cross.

386
00:32:06,730 --> 00:32:09,130
愿和平永存
The peace endures.

387
00:32:10,260 --> 00:32:12,300
愿和平永存
The peace endures.

388
00:32:13,430 --> 00:32:15,400
疑犯埃里克·拉马斯内尔
I present the accused,

389
00:32:15,440 --> 00:32:17,270
被指控谋杀第三十六任多兰
Ellic Lemasniel, for judgment,

390
00:32:17,300 --> 00:32:20,410
在此接受审判
for the murder of Dolan the 36th.

391
00:32:20,440 --> 00:32:22,980
这是在被告住所找到的证据
I present the evidence found in the accused's dwelling.

392
00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:26,150
找到的? 太轻描淡写了吧
Found? Oh, come on.

393
00:32:27,310 --> 00:32:30,420
看什么? 你们看起来像是八十年代的垃圾乐队
What? You look like a terrible band from the '80s.

394
00:32:32,290 --> 00:32:34,950
看看你们的发型!
Look at your hair!

395
00:32:34,990 --> 00:32:36,390
他将接受审判
He will be judged.

396
00:32:36,420 --> 00:32:38,160
巴拉 巴拉 巴拉
Blah, blah, blah.

397
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:40,930
你知道吗 我曾祖父的祖父
You know my great-grandfather's

398
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:42,700
曾侍候过黑巫后
grandfather served The Queen, huh?

399
00:32:42,730 --> 00:32:44,200
黑巫后
The Queen.

400
00:32:44,230 --> 00:32:45,870
你们不过是官僚机构的胆小鬼
You're a bureaucracy o' cowards

401
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:48,400
我不承认这个委员会的权威
and I don't recognize the authority here in this council.

402
00:32:48,440 --> 00:32:50,800
也不用遵守你们的法律
Nor do I abide by your law.

403
00:32:50,840 --> 00:32:55,140
法律是用来控制和规范魔法的使用
The laws serve to control and contain magic.

404
00:32:55,180 --> 00:32:58,210
只有依靠委员会的正常运行
It is only by the operations of this council

405
00:32:58,250 --> 00:33:00,250
才能避免战争的发生
that another war does not begin.

406
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:02,210
我不撒谎! 我为自己的行为感到骄傲!
I won't lie! I'm proud of what I done!

407
00:33:02,250 --> 00:33:04,450
我杀了你们的神父!
I murdered your priest!

408
00:33:04,490 --> 00:33:08,250
我把他像猪一样绑住 让他的血一点点流干!
I drip-dried him like he was a stuck pig!

409
00:33:08,290 --> 00:33:09,320
我们的神父 也是我的朋友
Our priest, and my friend.

410
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:11,790
卡尔德
Kaulder.

411
00:33:11,830 --> 00:33:13,830
见鬼 又是这个人
Oh, shit. This guy again.

412
00:33:13,860 --> 00:33:17,830
在审判他之前不先审问一下吗?
So we're to judge him without interrogation?

413
00:33:17,860 --> 00:33:20,070
有人问过他是否有同谋吗?
Has anyone asked him who he was workin' with?

414
00:33:23,770 --> 00:33:26,470
星币三这张牌没有出现
There's no Three of Pentacles card.

415
00:33:26,510 --> 00:33:27,710
也就意味着他是独立行动的
That means he worked alone.

416
00:33:27,740 --> 00:33:29,880
塔罗牌错了
The cards are wrong.

417
00:33:29,910 --> 00:33:32,350
他用了一个变形咒
He cast a shape-shifting spell.

418
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:37,220
我已经八百年没见过这种咒语了
I haven't seen that crafted in 800 years.

419
00:33:37,250 --> 00:33:39,320
黑巫后死后就再没见过
Not since the time of the Witch Queen.

420
00:33:39,350 --> 00:33:41,390
哈! 黑巫后早就死了
Ha! The Witch Queen is long dead.

421
00:33:41,400 --> 00:33:44,580
她的魔法不可能现世了
That her magic could return is impossible.

422
00:33:44,590 --> 00:33:46,200
- 真的不可能吗? - 是的
- Is it impossible? - It is.

423
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,470
- 你有能力... - 够了!
- You have the authority... - Enough!

424
00:33:47,510 --> 00:33:48,740
把这个城市调查个底朝天
to turn this city inside out.

425
00:33:48,770 --> 00:33:49,840
鉴于非法使用魔法...
For the crimes of illegal crafting...

426
00:33:49,880 --> 00:33:50,840
找出他替谁卖命
Find who he's working with.

427
00:33:50,880 --> 00:33:52,640
以及杀害人类的罪行...
and human sacrifice...

428
00:33:52,680 --> 00:33:53,650
- 我为自己的行为感到骄傲 - 我们判决...
- And I'm proud o' what I done. - we sentence...

429
00:33:53,680 --> 00:33:54,750
埃里克·拉马斯内尔...
Ellic Lemasniel...

430
00:33:54,780 --> 00:33:56,350
我没什么好遗憾的了
I'm proud o' what I done.

431
00:33:56,380 --> 00:33:58,280
- 囚禁于... - 我问心无愧!
- to incarceration... - I took a stand!

432
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,550
本密室深处岩床中
in the bedrock beneath this chamber.

433
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:02,890
苏醒吧 守卫
Arise, Sentinel,

434
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:06,390
将这个犯人送进监牢
and carry the condemned to prison.

435
00:34:17,170 --> 00:34:19,640
你将被永囚于黑暗
You'll never see daylight again.

436
00:34:23,610 --> 00:34:27,180
不 不! 你也许能困住我
No, no! You may hold me now,

437
00:34:27,210 --> 00:34:30,120
但你困不住我们所有人!
but you'll never have us all!

438
00:34:42,660 --> 00:34:44,600
这是什么?
What is that?

439
00:34:50,840 --> 00:34:52,540
嘿 孩子
Hey, kid.

440
00:34:52,570 --> 00:34:54,540
你要做什么?
What are you doing?

441
00:35:04,890 --> 00:35:07,220
你好 神父
Hello, Father.

442
00:35:17,230 --> 00:35:18,360
挺住啊 老伙计
Still with us, old friend.

443
00:35:18,400 --> 00:35:19,870
他还活着?
He's alive?

444
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:21,870
快不行了
Barely.

445
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:23,400
他被诅咒了
He's been cursed.

446
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,540
怎么会?
How?

447
00:35:25,570 --> 00:35:26,910
蝇马利
Musca Mali.

448
00:35:26,940 --> 00:35:28,210
瘟疫蝇
Plague fly.

449
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:30,480
13世纪的黑魔法
13th-century black magic.

450
00:35:30,510 --> 00:35:32,240
源自黑巫后之树 对吧?
They were created in the tree of the Queen, correct?

451
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:34,480
是的
That's right.

452
00:35:34,510 --> 00:35:36,550
为什么他们不直接杀了他?
Why didn't they just murder him?

453
00:35:36,580 --> 00:35:38,850
他们想先审问他
They wanted to interrogate him.

454
00:35:38,890 --> 00:35:40,920
一旦瘟疫蝇钻进你身体里
When a Plague fly burrows inside of you,

455
00:35:40,950 --> 00:35:42,890
它就霸占了你的意识
it breaks your will.

456
00:35:42,920 --> 00:35:44,590
不管凶手想知道什么
Whatever the killers wanted to know,

457
00:35:44,620 --> 00:35:47,430
多兰都会说出来
he would have told them.

458
00:35:51,630 --> 00:35:55,270
但问题是 他们到底想知道什么?
But the question remains, what did they want to know?

459
00:35:55,300 --> 00:35:57,000
他没醒过来
He isn't getting up.

460
00:35:57,040 --> 00:35:58,840
除非我们能破除诅咒
Not unless we could break the curse.

461
00:35:58,870 --> 00:36:00,040
而唯一的办法
And the only way to do that

462
00:36:00,070 --> 00:36:01,570
就是杀掉下咒的巫师
is to kill the witch who cast it.

463
00:36:01,610 --> 00:36:03,540
那个埃里克效命的人
The one Ellic works for.

464
00:36:04,910 --> 00:36:08,110
多兰最多只能撑两天

465
00:36:08,150 --> 00:36:10,350
为了我 坚持住
Hang in there, for me.

466
00:36:26,530 --> 00:36:28,470
死亡
Death.

467
00:36:28,500 --> 00:36:31,270
那是多兰留的消息 不是凶手留的
It's a message from Dolan, not the killer.

468
00:36:37,180 --> 00:36:38,650
"回忆你的死亡"
"Remember your death."

469
00:36:38,680 --> 00:36:40,680
什么意思?
What does it mean?

470
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:45,720
唯一能让我回想起自己的死亡的...
There's only one way to remember my death...

471
00:36:45,750 --> 00:36:47,650
只有魔法
Magic.

472
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,690
嗨 克洛伊
Hey, Chloe.

473
00:36:55,660 --> 00:36:57,600
这边还有一杯
I have one more drink here.

474
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:01,700
- 你们玩得开心吗? - 不错
- Are you guys okay? - Yeah, we're good.

475
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:03,300
帅哥们 晚上过得好吗?
Are we having a good night, gentlemen?

476
00:37:03,340 --> 00:37:05,110
宝贝 和我一起喝杯爱酒吧
Do a love shot with me, baby.

477
00:37:05,140 --> 00:37:07,780
哦 算了 我今晚不求爱
Oh, no. I'm not looking for love tonight.

478
00:37:11,110 --> 00:37:12,980
- 你们还好吗? - 很好
- You guys okay? - Yep.

479
00:37:36,240 --> 00:37:38,900
哦 不 有没有搞错! 别啊 你不能走
Oh, no, come on! No, not you, too.

480
00:37:38,940 --> 00:37:40,740
我听说 他是个特别反复无常的人
I heard that you can't tell before it happens. Okay?

481
00:37:40,780 --> 00:37:41,910
开头还是一派冷静的样子 接着...
He's just standing there all chilly calm, and then...

482
00:37:41,940 --> 00:37:43,280
刷! 砍下了你的头
Wham! He cuts your head off

483
00:37:43,310 --> 00:37:44,940
系在他裤腰带上
and puts it in a sack on his belt.

484
00:37:44,980 --> 00:37:45,950
拜托! 这只是保姆讲给孩子们听
C'mon! That's just a story nannies tell children

485
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:47,210
吓唬他们的
so they behave.

486
00:37:47,250 --> 00:37:50,750
克洛伊 快走吧
Chloe, you need to leave.

487
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:53,850
米兰达 米兰达!
Miranda. Miranda!

488
00:38:00,130 --> 00:38:03,300
我们守规矩的 这里没有人类
We're up to code. There are no humans here.

489
00:38:03,330 --> 00:38:05,360
地方不错啊

491
00:38:07,270 --> 00:38:09,870
你们怎么收费?
How much do you charge?

492
00:38:09,900 --> 00:38:11,400
那要看你买什么了
Well, that depends on what you're buying.

493
00:38:11,440 --> 00:38:14,170

495
00:38:18,080 --> 00:38:20,010
成交
Deal.

496
00:38:20,050 --> 00:38:23,250
我刚刚说了"百"? 其实...
Did I just say "Hundred"? I...

497
00:38:23,280 --> 00:38:26,150
说错了 我其实是想说"五千美金"
No, you know what? I actually meant "Five thousand."

498
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:27,420
五千 你确定了吗?
Five thousand, is that what you meant?

499
00:38:27,460 --> 00:38:29,290
确定 是"五千美金"
I did. I meant "Five thousand."

500
00:38:29,320 --> 00:38:31,260
成交
Sold.

501
00:38:31,290 --> 00:38:33,230
五万美金

502
00:38:34,930 --> 00:38:36,930
可以开始了吗?
Shall we start?

503
00:38:36,960 --> 00:38:38,270
不 什么来着? 算了
No. You know what? No.

504
00:38:38,300 --> 00:38:41,130
我改主意了 我要关...
I changed my mind. We're cl...

505
00:38:45,210 --> 00:38:47,340
恐惧药水
Fear potion.

506
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:52,410
你会害怕什么?
Now, what in the world would you be afraid of?

507
00:38:52,450 --> 00:38:54,810
演讲
Public speaking.

508
00:38:54,850 --> 00:38:55,950
你知道我怕什么吗?
You know what I'm afraid of?

509
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:57,450
说吧
Enlighten me.

510
00:38:57,490 --> 00:39:00,250
还真没怕的 这种生活可无聊了
Nothing. It's boring, really.

511
00:39:01,460 --> 00:39:05,390
听着 我知道你做事讲规矩
See now, I know that you have a code.

512
00:39:05,430 --> 00:39:08,460
我也知道 我没做错什么
And I also know that I haven't done anything wrong,

513
00:39:09,800 --> 00:39:15,130
所以除非你准备一枪打爆我 不然的话 恕不远送
so unless you're gonna put a gun to my head, get out.

514
00:39:15,170 --> 00:39:19,040
你没说错 我是讲规矩的
You know, you're right. I do have a code.

515
00:39:19,070 --> 00:39:23,280
但我也不会就这么走了
But I'm also not leaving.

516
00:39:25,250 --> 00:39:27,880
话说 你要记忆药水做什么?
What do you want a memory potion for, anyway?

517
00:39:27,920 --> 00:39:30,050
你是在猎巫吗?
Are you hunting a witch?

518
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:32,320
为了帮助一个老朋友
To help an old friend.

519
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:47,970
事先提醒
But a word of warning to you.

520
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:49,070
如果在记忆中受伤
If you get injured in your memory,

521
00:39:49,100 --> 00:39:51,300
你的肉体也会遭受相同伤害
you get injured out here.

522
00:39:51,340 --> 00:39:53,170
也就是说 如果记忆中的你死了
Which means to say that if you die in there,

523
00:39:53,210 --> 00:39:54,170
你就真的会死...
you will also die...

524
00:39:54,210 --> 00:39:56,780
我反正是不死身
I can't die anywhere.

525
00:39:56,810 --> 00:39:59,050
就是个保险上的免责协议罢了
I have to make a disclaimer for my insurance.

526
00:40:05,390 --> 00:40:07,320
我先干了
Bottoms up.

527
00:40:34,180 --> 00:40:36,320
说"巫师猎人"
Say "Witch hunter."

528
00:40:36,350 --> 00:40:38,280
巫师猎人

529

老实点
Be nice.

530
00:42:44,380 --> 00:42:46,410
"回忆你的死亡"
"Remember your death."

531
00:42:46,450 --> 00:42:49,520
你到底想要我看什么?
What did you want me to see?

532
00:42:49,550 --> 00:42:52,450
卡尔德!
Kaulder!

533
00:42:52,490 --> 00:42:54,620
卡尔德
Kaulder.

534
00:42:57,390 --> 00:43:00,060
卡尔德 醒醒
Kaulder, wake up.

535
00:43:12,570 --> 00:43:15,210
你好啊 巫师猎人
Well, hello, witch hunter.

536
00:43:18,510 --> 00:43:21,580
我也曾经被人从记忆咒语中强拉出来过
I was yanked out of a memory spell once.

537
00:43:21,610 --> 00:43:24,050
脑子迷糊了好几个小时
My mind was scrambled eggs for hours.

538
00:43:27,650 --> 00:43:30,260
要知道 人类不该去寻找过去
You know, people shouldn't root around in their past.

539
00:43:30,290 --> 00:43:32,990
有些事情 还是忘记比较好
Some things are best left forgotten.

540
00:43:54,480 --> 00:43:56,420
啊...
Ah...

541
00:44:27,450 --> 00:44:29,050
你诅咒了我朋友
You cursed my friend.

542
00:44:32,450 --> 00:44:34,450
你的朋友
Your friend,

543
00:44:34,490 --> 00:44:37,520
他比大多数人多坚持了5分钟
he lasted about five minutes longer than most.

544
00:44:47,500 --> 00:44:49,540
当你死不掉的时候 酒吧斗殴
Doesn't take much balls to get in a bar fight

545
00:44:49,570 --> 00:44:51,500
都不用先壮胆了吧
when you can't get hurt.

546
00:44:57,240 --> 00:44:58,540
可惜你的思维没有...
Too bad your mind isn't as tough

547
00:44:58,580 --> 00:45:00,510
你身体这么强壮
as the rest of you.

548
00:45:01,580 --> 00:45:03,220
不会有酒吧了
No more bar.

549
00:45:03,250 --> 00:45:05,790
也不会有记忆药水了
No more memory potions for you.

550
00:45:53,630 --> 00:45:55,570

552
00:46:18,930 --> 00:46:22,430
800年了 你的气数也该用尽了
After 800 years, you've run out of time.

553
00:46:22,460 --> 00:46:25,300
死期将至 巫师猎人!
Death is coming, witch hunter!

554
00:46:40,980 --> 00:46:43,280
你和别人说的恶魔没两样
You are the monster they say you are.

555
00:46:44,520 --> 00:46:47,150
都怪你! 这是我全部家当了!
Damn you! This place was all I had!

556
00:49:13,700 --> 00:49:14,830
克洛伊!

00:49:14,870 --> 00:49:16,800

我发誓 我会找出凶手 破除诅咒
I promise I'll find who did this and break the curse.

563
00:50:12,490 --> 00:50:13,530

停下
Stop.

567
00:50:17,660 --> 00:50:19,970
就是他
That's him.

568
00:50:20,000 --> 00:50:22,830
为什么他不想我回忆起自己的死?
But why doesn't he want me to remember my death?

姓名 巴尔塔萨·凯托拉

他就是埃里克卖命的主子

572
00:50:29,880 --> 00:50:32,940
就是他诅咒了多兰?

573
00:50:32,980 --> 00:50:34,450
为了毁灭这世界
Every generation has to be given

574
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:36,650
巫师还真是一代代不死不休啊

575
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:39,190
但我们大部分人和他不同
Yet most of us aren't like him, you know.

576
00:50:39,220 --> 00:50:42,050
我们和你们差不多
We're the same as you.

577
00:50:42,090 --> 00:50:45,420
你的外貌也许和我们相似 内里却不同
You may look like us, but you're not.

578
00:50:45,460 --> 00:50:47,730
你血液中流淌着魔法

我在乎的所有东西都付诸一炬了
Where everything I cared about burnt to the ground.

584
00:50:59,570 --> 00:51:01,870
但我不是在怪你毁了我的生活
But I'm not blaming you for destroying

585
00:51:01,910 --> 00:51:04,040

00:51:04,080 --> 00:51:07,010
我恨的是自己只能冷眼旁观
I'm just making an observation.

587
00:51:07,050 --> 00:51:11,550

I'm leaving.

听着 我也不想事情变成这样

但如果你帮助我 我会保证你的人身安全

我需要雪墩山柳菊
I'll need more Snowdonia hawkweed

Analyze this and see what we get.

你们巫师是这么形容我的吗?
So that's what you witches think of me, huh?

617

那人类又是怎么形容我们的呢?

619
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:51,750
戴着尖顶帽
and like to wear pointy hats,

620
00:52:51,780 --> 00:52:53,050
脾气暴躁
and that we're mean

621
00:52:53,090 --> 00:52:55,920
被烧死在塞勒姆的火刑柱上?
and got burned at the stake in Salem?

622
00:52:58,990 --> 00:53:01,590
塞勒姆小镇的事是错的
Salem was wrong,

623
00:53:01,630 --> 00:53:04,200
那些女人是无辜的
And those women innocent.

624
00:53:04,230 --> 00:53:07,330
如果那些女人真的是巫师呢?
But what if those women really were witches?

625
00:53:07,370 --> 00:53:09,730
她们就活该被烧死吗?
Would it then have been okay?

626
00:53:09,770 --> 00:53:14,110
我记得自己想过 如果是我被判刑的话
See, I remember thinking if it was me found guilty,

627
00:53:15,610 --> 00:53:17,810
没人会在乎
no one would care.

628
00:53:17,840 --> 00:53:19,780
我在乎
I would.

629
00:53:28,710 --> 00:53:30,910
山柳菊没了 它不见了
The hawkweed's gone. It's gone.

630
00:53:30,940 --> 00:53:33,080
有人把它拿走了 它不在这了
I mean, someone's taken it. It's not here.

631
00:53:35,410 --> 00:53:37,350
卡尔德?
Kaulder?

632
00:53:38,380 --> 00:53:40,550
怎么了?
What?

633
00:53:40,590 --> 00:53:43,450
- 怎么了? - 别看
- What? - No.

634
00:53:43,490 --> 00:53:45,390
是米兰达
Miranda.

635
00:53:45,430 --> 00:53:46,960
米兰达!
Miranda!

636
00:53:54,400 --> 00:53:57,040
你来晚了 巫师猎人
You're too late, witch hunter.

637
00:53:57,070 --> 00:54:00,710
她死的真惨 既恐惧
She died badly, screaming.

638
00:54:00,740 --> 00:54:03,210
又孤单
Alone.

639
00:54:03,240 --> 00:54:05,210
就和你将来的下场一样
Just like you will.

640
00:54:18,460 --> 00:54:20,930
你会抓到凶手的 对吗?
You're gonna get who did this, right?

641
00:54:21,060 --> 00:54:24,000
我会解决贝利亚的
I'll handle Belial.

642
00:54:24,030 --> 00:54:26,300
很好
Good.

643
00:54:28,140 --> 00:54:31,210
我不知道还有哪里能弄到所需的材料
I don't know where else to get the stuff that we need.

644
00:54:33,550 --> 00:54:35,680
有一个地方
There is one place.

645
00:54:38,580 --> 00:54:42,550
不过那里充斥着旧货币 古魔法 非常危险
But it's old money, old magic, and dangerous.

646
00:54:55,940 --> 00:54:57,870
抱歉
I'm sorry.

647
00:55:17,960 --> 00:55:18,920
卡尔德?
Kaulder?

648
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:20,890
索尼娅
Sonya.

649
00:55:25,360 --> 00:55:27,300
丹妮卡可是个大忙人
Danique's been so busy,

650
00:55:27,330 --> 00:55:28,870
我很讶异她竟会同意见你
I'm surprised that she agreed to see you.

651
00:55:28,900 --> 00:55:29,870
我想她不会喜欢
I don't think she would have liked

652
00:55:29,900 --> 00:55:31,370
另一个选择的后果
the alternative.

653
00:55:48,920 --> 00:55:51,420
卡尔德先生 很高兴你今晚能来
Mr. Kaulder, you've made my night.

654
00:55:53,230 --> 00:55:55,190
请坐
Please have a seat.

655
00:55:56,760 --> 00:55:58,960
你是从哪里捡来这个小朋友的 二手商店?
Where'd you rescue your little friend from, a thrift shop?

656
00:55:59,000 --> 00:55:59,960
小朋友...
Little friend....

657
00:56:03,740 --> 00:56:06,470
告诉我 什么事那么急?
So tell me, what is this emergency?

658
00:56:06,510 --> 00:56:07,910
你有什么必须要想起来的?
What is it you just must remember?

659
00:56:07,940 --> 00:56:11,210
他丢了他的车钥匙
He lost his car keys.

660
00:56:11,240 --> 00:56:12,910
我要给你多少钱?
How much do I owe you?

661
00:56:12,950 --> 00:56:15,250
一分钱也不用 只要你陪我喝一杯就好
Oh, nothing. You have a drink with me. That's my price.

662
00:56:15,280 --> 00:56:17,380
你知道我为何而来
You know what I'm here for.

663
00:56:20,720 --> 00:56:23,990
芸芸众生都试图伪装自己
So many of us pretend to be something that we're not.

664
00:56:24,020 --> 00:56:28,360
可是你 却真实的活着
But you, you've lived.

665
00:56:28,390 --> 00:56:30,760
你穿越了历史的长河
A man who's walked through history.

666
00:56:30,800 --> 00:56:34,370
你见过拿破仑 斯大林
To have known Napoleon, Stalin,

667
00:56:34,400 --> 00:56:36,300
希特勒...
Hitler...

668
00:56:36,340 --> 00:56:40,240
别怀旧了 这个时代已经够邪恶了
No need to be nostalgic. We have enough evil now.

669
00:56:40,270 --> 00:56:43,440
他们和你没有太大的不同
They're not so different than you.

670
00:56:43,480 --> 00:56:45,880
他们用自己的力量来改变世界
They used their power to change the world.

671
00:56:45,910 --> 00:56:48,550
你不能改变过去所做之事
You can't change what you've done.

672
00:56:52,620 --> 00:56:55,490
卡尔德! 这株植物有点不对劲
Kaulder! There's something wrong with this plant.

673
00:57:02,300 --> 00:57:03,260
你来了
You're here.

674
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:05,230
卡尔德...
Kaulder...

675
00:57:07,470 --> 00:57:09,530
卡尔德! 卡尔德!
Kaulder! Kaulder!

676
00:57:09,570 --> 00:57:11,500
- 欢迎来到天堂 - 卡尔德!
- Enjoy paradise. - Kaulder!

677
00:57:11,540 --> 00:57:13,470
卡尔德 那些烟 别...
Kaulder, it's smoke. Don't...

678
00:57:20,350 --> 00:57:22,310
看 父亲 看!
Look, Daddy. Look!

679
00:57:22,350 --> 00:57:24,280
它们要飞到南方过冬了
They're flying south for the winter.

680
00:57:30,060 --> 00:57:33,290
卡尔德 听我说
Kaulder, listen to me.

681
00:57:33,330 --> 00:57:36,560
你中了陷阱 我需要你醒来
You are in a trap and I need you to wake up.

682
00:57:45,770 --> 00:57:48,810
你在这里是找不到答案的
You're not gonna find any answers here.

683
00:57:48,840 --> 00:57:51,540
呆的时间越长 你就越难离开
The longer you wait, the harder it is to get out.

684
00:58:00,550 --> 00:58:02,590
卡尔德 卡尔德
Kaulder. Kaulder.

685
00:58:02,620 --> 00:58:05,620
我需要你醒来 这一切都不是真实的
I need you to wake up. None of this is real.

686
00:58:05,660 --> 00:58:07,690
卡尔德 你中计了!
Kaulder, you are in a trap!

687
00:58:13,000 --> 00:58:14,930
快回来
Come back.

688
00:58:17,100 --> 00:58:19,400
卡尔德 如果你不马上醒来
Kaulder, if you don't wake up right now,

689
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:22,070
我们都会死的!
we are both going to die!

690
00:58:22,110 --> 00:58:24,110
快醒醒!
Wake up!

691
00:58:24,140 --> 00:58:26,080
克洛伊...
Chloe...

692
00:58:32,420 --> 00:58:35,820
这不是真的
This isn't real.

693
00:58:35,860 --> 00:58:39,560
卡尔德! 快醒醒!
Kaulder! Wake up!

694
00:58:40,990 --> 00:58:42,460
把车开到巷子里
Pull the car into the alley

695
00:58:42,490 --> 00:58:43,930
然后把他扔进后备箱
and throw him in the trunk.

696
00:58:43,960 --> 00:58:45,800
我们将因为打败巫师猎人
We're going down in history

697
00:58:45,830 --> 00:58:47,830
而闻名于世了
as the ones who beat the witch hunter.

698
00:58:52,970 --> 00:58:54,570
拜托
Come on.

699
00:58:54,610 --> 00:58:56,540
出去
Get out.

700
00:59:05,020 --> 00:59:07,390
葬土
Burial dirt.

701
00:59:07,420 --> 00:59:10,360
是黑暗魔法最强大的原料
Nothing more powerful for dark magic.

702
00:59:14,130 --> 00:59:16,460
贝利亚要用它来做什么?
What does Belial want with it?

703
00:59:16,490 --> 00:59:18,500
谁?
Who?

704
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:22,100
"回忆我的死亡"
"Remember my death."

705
00:59:22,130 --> 00:59:25,370
他到底不想让我知道什么?
What is it that he doesn't want me to see?

706
00:59:26,910 --> 00:59:30,010
住手! 拜托了
Stop! Please.

707
00:59:32,710 --> 00:59:34,680
贝利亚什么也没告诉我
Belial didn't tell me anything.

708
00:59:34,710 --> 00:59:36,850
我只负责帮他弄到土
I helped him get the dirt.

709
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:38,980
我自己私藏了一丁点
I just took a little bit for myself.

710
00:59:39,020 --> 00:59:41,950
可他有一大堆
He has tons of it.

711
00:59:41,990 --> 00:59:43,920
拜托了?
Please?

712
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:53,060
谢谢你的酒
Thanks for the drink.

713
00:59:55,800 --> 00:59:58,440
你这个巫师族的叛徒!
You are a traitor to your kind!

714
00:59:59,900 --> 01:00:02,510
你知道我为什么喜欢旧货商店吗?
You know what I like about thrift shops?

715
01:00:03,840 --> 01:00:05,980
因为那里的一切都是老的
Everything in them is old.

716
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:32,100
贱人
Bitch.

717
01:00:41,250 --> 01:00:43,450
现在你知道了
So now you know.

718
01:00:47,890 --> 01:00:50,550
你是一个梦行者
You're a dream-walker.

719
01:00:50,590 --> 01:00:53,560
人人都知道梦行是一种黑暗的天赋
Everyone knows that dream-walking is a black gift.

720
01:00:56,530 --> 01:01:00,600
我一辈子都在试图隐藏它
I've spent my entire life trying to hide from it.

721
01:01:00,630 --> 01:01:03,840
你知道我会发现你的秘密 可你并不在乎
You knew I would discover your secret, and you didn't care.

722
01:01:05,840 --> 01:01:08,140
你还是义无反顾地将我拉出陷阱
You still pulled me out of that trap.

723
01:01:09,170 --> 01:01:12,180
那真是非常勇敢的举动
It was a very brave thing to do.

724
01:01:12,210 --> 01:01:15,150
我有东西要给你看 来吧
Let me show you something. Come on.

725
01:01:16,250 --> 01:01:18,480
晚安 麦克斯!
Good night, Max!

726
01:01:46,080 --> 01:01:48,280
你是我族的耻辱
You are a disgrace to our kind.

727
01:01:48,310 --> 01:01:50,710
贝利亚 我别无选择
Belial, I had no choice.

728
01:01:50,750 --> 01:01:52,880
卡尔德威胁说要把我活活打死
Kaulder threatened to beat me to death with his bare hands.

729
01:01:52,920 --> 01:01:55,020
我们会处置你的 叛徒
We have plans for you, traitor.

730
01:01:56,860 --> 01:01:57,890
你得理解我 贝利亚
You must understand, Belial.

731
01:02:01,060 --> 01:02:02,790
好好享受那些影子吧
Enjoy the shadows.

732
01:02:24,780 --> 01:02:29,320
这是巫师的历史 你们的历史
This is the history of witches. Your history.

733
01:02:31,160 --> 01:02:32,320
那是你
That's you.

734
01:02:32,360 --> 01:02:33,790
对
Yeah.

735
01:02:33,830 --> 01:02:36,190
至少眼睛很形象
Least they got your eyes right.

736
01:02:38,400 --> 01:02:40,830
这些都是梦行者
These are the dream-walkers.

737
01:02:40,870 --> 01:02:43,340
黑巫后身边最致命的刺客
The Witch Queen's deadliest assassins.

738
01:02:43,370 --> 01:02:45,170
他们会用某种方式进入你的脑中
Somehow they used to jump into your mind

739
01:02:45,200 --> 01:02:47,810
窥探你最珍贵的记忆
and pry out your most precious memories.

740
01:02:47,840 --> 01:02:51,980
并把它们转化成你最可怕的噩梦
And then they'd twist 'em into your worst nightmares.

741
01:02:52,010 --> 01:02:53,240
你是在给我上历史课
What, you're giving a history lesson here

742
01:02:53,280 --> 01:02:55,080
还是只为了吓我?
or you're just trying to scare me?

743
01:02:55,110 --> 01:02:57,750
关于梦行者 有一件事无人知晓
There's something no one knows about dream-walkers.

744
01:02:59,020 --> 01:03:02,020
他们不需要什么记忆药水
They don't need memory potions.

745
01:03:02,050 --> 01:03:05,220
那种力量是他们与生俱来的
That power lies within them.

746
01:03:05,260 --> 01:03:07,790
我的脑海深处有一样
I have something buried deep in my mind

747
01:03:07,830 --> 01:03:09,900
必须回想起来的事
that I must remember.

748
01:03:11,800 --> 01:03:14,870
你是唯一一个能帮助我找回记忆的人
And you're the only one that can help me.

749
01:03:14,900 --> 01:03:16,130
不 我不行
No, I can't.

750
01:03:16,170 --> 01:03:17,840
克洛伊...
Chloe...

751
01:03:17,870 --> 01:03:19,800
我不行
No, I can't.

752
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:24,110
我有一个小弟弟
You know, I have a younger brother,

753
01:03:24,140 --> 01:03:26,410
而且...
and, uh,

754
01:03:26,450 --> 01:03:31,180
他总有办法把我惹恼
he had this knack for just pissing me off.

755
01:03:31,220 --> 01:03:33,350
有一天他做得太过了
And one day he pushed it too far,

756
01:03:33,380 --> 01:03:36,650
于是不知怎的 我进入了他的脑中
and I somehow entered his mind.

757
01:03:36,690 --> 01:03:39,220
虽然不是故意的 可是我伤害了他
I hurt him. I didn't mean to,

758
01:03:39,260 --> 01:03:42,690
狠狠地伤害了他
but I hurt him badly.

759
01:03:42,730 --> 01:03:44,960
所以我逃走了
So I ran away.

760
01:04:03,850 --> 01:04:08,290
你的妻女 她们的名字是什么?
What were their names, your wife and daughter?

761
01:04:08,320 --> 01:04:10,260
我妻子叫海伦娜
Helena.

762
01:04:11,290 --> 01:04:13,320
女儿叫伊丽莎白
Elizabeth.

763
01:04:16,360 --> 01:04:19,860
我已经很久没有念过她们的名字了
I haven't said their names out loud in a long time.

764
01:04:24,870 --> 01:04:27,170
卡尔德 即使我想要帮助你
Kaulder, even if I wanted to help you,

765
01:04:27,210 --> 01:04:29,140
我也不知道从哪里入手
I wouldn't know where to begin.

766
01:04:32,080 --> 01:04:36,050
想一个可以关联起你我的词
Think of a word that you associate with me.

767
01:04:36,080 --> 01:04:38,720
什么都可以
Could be anything.

768
01:04:38,750 --> 01:04:41,950
把你的脑海放空
Empty everything else out of your head.

769
01:04:44,420 --> 01:04:47,360
把思想集中在那个词上面
And just focus on that one word.

770
01:04:47,390 --> 01:04:49,330
一个词
One word.

771
01:04:51,100 --> 01:04:53,900
告诉我那个词 我也会把思想集中在它上面
If you tell me the word, I'll focus on it, too.

772
01:04:53,930 --> 01:04:55,930
有时候这招会管用
Sometimes that helps.

773
01:04:55,970 --> 01:04:58,040
那个词是什么?
What's the word?

774
01:04:59,770 --> 01:05:01,770
孤独
Alone.

775
01:05:31,070 --> 01:05:33,200
抓住我的手
Take my hand.

776
01:06:09,610 --> 01:06:12,410
这边来 伙计们!
This way, men!

777
01:06:12,440 --> 01:06:14,550
多兰兄弟 看
Brother Dolan, look.

778
01:06:20,250 --> 01:06:21,990
卡尔德
Kaulder.

779
01:06:25,060 --> 01:06:27,560
那是什么? 多兰?
What is that? Dolan?

780
01:06:27,590 --> 01:06:30,060
小心点
Tread with care.

781
01:06:30,090 --> 01:06:32,230
他做到了
He did it.

782
01:06:35,370 --> 01:06:37,300
他成功杀死了黑巫后
So ends the Queen.

783
01:06:41,040 --> 01:06:42,610
以父之名...
In the name of the Father...

784
01:06:42,640 --> 01:06:44,410
他被附身了!
He's possessed!

785
01:06:44,440 --> 01:06:46,480
卡尔德还活着
Kaulder is alive.

786
01:06:46,510 --> 01:06:48,410
我们的噩梦在奇迹中结束
Our nightmare ends with a miracle.

787
01:06:48,450 --> 01:06:51,020
帮帮他
Help him.

788
01:06:51,050 --> 01:06:52,550
帮帮他
Help him.

789
01:06:55,620 --> 01:06:57,550
那是她的心脏
It's her heart.

790
01:06:57,590 --> 01:07:00,630
一旦我们摧毁了它 她就灰飞烟灭了
When we destroy it, we destroy her.

791
01:07:00,660 --> 01:07:02,590
你来摧毁它吧 多兰兄弟
End it, Brother Dolan.

792
01:07:23,380 --> 01:07:25,380
消灭她 多兰!
Destroy her, Dolan!

793
01:07:28,020 --> 01:07:29,950
不!
No!

794
01:07:36,060 --> 01:07:38,060
你竟然保留了它
You kept it.

795
01:07:39,300 --> 01:07:43,130
结束了 黑巫后死了
It's over. The Witch Queen is dead.

796
01:07:48,010 --> 01:07:50,570
他们从一开始就背叛了你
They betrayed you from the start.

797
01:07:50,610 --> 01:07:53,940
所以他们会折磨你的朋友
That's why they tortured your friend.

798
01:07:53,980 --> 01:07:56,410
因为他知道心脏的所在之处
Because he knew where the heart was.

799
01:07:56,450 --> 01:07:58,380
他们要复活黑巫后
They're gonna bring back the Queen.

800
01:08:06,360 --> 01:08:08,090
八百年了
For eight hundred years,

801
01:08:08,130 --> 01:08:09,860
我们一直在等待她的归来
we've waited for her return.

802
01:08:11,730 --> 01:08:13,560
你应该感到荣幸 叛徒
You should be honored, traitor.

803
01:08:13,600 --> 01:08:16,670
你将为我们的大业献出生命
You will be sacrificed for our cause.

804
01:08:20,570 --> 01:08:22,440
卡尔德 我知道贝利亚把那些土带去哪了
Kaulder, I know where Belial brought all that dirt.

805
01:08:22,470 --> 01:08:24,710
他租的那辆卡车有定位功...
The truck he rented had a standard GPS locator...

806
01:08:24,740 --> 01:08:26,280
你骗了我!
You lied to me!

807
01:08:26,310 --> 01:08:30,480
你保存着她的心脏 "回忆你的死亡"
You saved her heart. "Remember your death."

808
01:08:30,510 --> 01:08:32,480
不是你想的那样
It's not what you think.

809
01:08:34,720 --> 01:08:37,190
你一直知道这句话的意思 却什么也不说
You knew what it meant all along, and you said nothing.

810
01:08:37,220 --> 01:08:39,360
因为我不希望自己甫一上任
Because I wasn't going to be responsible

811
01:08:39,390 --> 01:08:42,030
就让十字斧教分崩离析...
for the dissolution of The Axe and Cross on my very first...

812
01:08:42,060 --> 01:08:44,160
他们要复活黑巫后
They're bringing back the Queen.

813
01:08:46,630 --> 01:08:48,670
你不知道自己干了什么
You don't know what you've done.

814
01:08:50,000 --> 01:08:53,140
我曾宣誓过要保守秘密
I swore an oath to keep it secret.

815
01:08:54,310 --> 01:08:58,610
数百年来 这秘密牵制着末日的降临
This lie has kept Apocalypse at bay for hundreds of years.

816
01:08:58,640 --> 01:09:01,110
我们害怕一旦黑巫后的心脏被毁
We were afraid if the Queen's heart was destroyed,

817
01:09:01,150 --> 01:09:03,210
你就会失去永生 甚至死亡
you'd lose your immortality. Or die.

818
01:09:03,250 --> 01:09:05,450
那不是由你们说了算!
That wasn't your choice to make!

819
01:09:09,050 --> 01:09:10,990
老多兰就是那么想的
That's what the old man thought.

820
01:09:13,460 --> 01:09:16,060
我想他被攻击的那晚
The night he was attacked,

821
01:09:16,090 --> 01:09:18,200
曾想要摧毁它
I think he was going to destroy it.

822
01:09:19,230 --> 01:09:21,170
为了你
For you.

823
01:09:26,740 --> 01:09:28,740
为了让你自由
To set you free.

824
01:09:39,050 --> 01:09:41,720
至少十字斧教还有他们的武器
At least The Axe and Cross still has their weapon.

825
01:09:48,130 --> 01:09:49,730
你将为黑巫后效命...
You will serve the Queen...

826
01:09:49,760 --> 01:09:51,760
不 拜托了
No, please.

827
01:09:51,800 --> 01:09:54,600
不管愿不愿意
like it or not.

828
01:10:21,460 --> 01:10:24,300
去我的公寓 那里很安全
Go to my apartment. You'll be safe there.

829
01:10:24,330 --> 01:10:27,130
不 说好了我们两一起行动的
No, the deal was that we stick together.

830
01:10:27,160 --> 01:10:28,770
我要一个人去 连自己人都不可信
I'm going alone. If I can't trust

831
01:10:28,800 --> 01:10:31,270
又凭什么相信你?
my own people, how the hell can I trust you?

832
01:10:33,840 --> 01:10:37,140
你不是这样的人
This isn't who you are.

833
01:10:37,170 --> 01:10:39,340
我就是这样的人
It's all I am.

834
01:11:09,610 --> 01:11:11,610
用铁刺她
Pierce her with iron.

835
01:11:11,640 --> 01:11:14,880
用火烧她
Scour her by fire.

836
01:11:14,910 --> 01:11:17,580
让她永远的死去
Bring her endless death.

837
01:11:44,840 --> 01:11:48,410
我很想念你 卡尔德
I've missed you, Kaulder.

838
01:11:48,410 --> 01:11:51,010
这就是你不明白的事
Here's what you don't understand.

839
01:11:51,040 --> 01:11:53,980
你的族人永远都不会明白的
What your kind never understood.

840
01:11:54,010 --> 01:11:56,550
我已经饶过你一次
I've shown mercy.

841
01:11:56,580 --> 01:11:59,980
我本可以把你们全部杀光的
I could have killed every last one of you.

842
01:12:00,020 --> 01:12:02,550
我计算过
I've done the math.

843
01:12:02,590 --> 01:12:04,590
我有过机会的
I've had the time.

844
01:12:04,620 --> 01:12:08,430
你现在和以前不同了 如此自信
You're different now. So confident.

845
01:12:08,460 --> 01:12:10,900
全靠你赐给我不死之身
Maybe you shouldn't have made me immortal.

846
01:12:13,330 --> 01:12:15,400
卡尔德 我是来帮忙的
Kaulder, I came to help.

847
01:12:15,430 --> 01:12:18,600
克洛伊 我告诉你不要...
Chloe. I told you not to...

848
01:12:49,330 --> 01:12:54,370
不死之身从来都不属于你 它是我的
Immortality was never yours. It was mine.

849
01:12:56,610 --> 01:12:59,170
你只是替我保管它
You just carried it for me.

850
01:12:59,510 --> 01:13:01,810
直到现在
Until now.

851
01:13:04,680 --> 01:13:08,320
我重生了
I am reborn.

852
01:13:39,220 --> 01:13:42,190
你的种族
Your race

853
01:13:42,220 --> 01:13:45,620
终日都在担惊受怕
has always been frightened.

854
01:13:48,560 --> 01:13:51,630
藏在洞穴里
Hiding in caves.

855
01:13:51,660 --> 01:13:54,170
挤在火堆旁
Huddling around fire.

856
01:13:56,070 --> 01:13:57,370
终于
Finally.

857
01:15:02,330 --> 01:15:05,770
嘿 孩子 我还在担心是不是太晚了
Hey, kid. I was afraid I was too late.

858
01:15:05,800 --> 01:15:08,710
但愿我的样子没你那么糟
I hope I don't look as rough as you do.

859
01:15:09,740 --> 01:15:12,410
好了
Okay.

860
01:15:15,380 --> 01:15:17,380
我杀死了诅咒你的人
I killed the one who cursed you.

861
01:15:17,420 --> 01:15:19,850
来
Here.

862
01:15:19,880 --> 01:15:21,820
把这个喝了
Drink this.

863
01:15:27,360 --> 01:15:29,290
谢谢
Thank you.

864
01:15:31,830 --> 01:15:34,300
黑巫后复活了
The Witch Queen has returned.

865
01:15:35,600 --> 01:15:37,400
我以为我的不死之身
I thought my immortality

866
01:15:37,430 --> 01:15:39,900
是她惩罚我的方法
was the way that she punished me.

867
01:15:39,940 --> 01:15:43,740
但她只是利用我来为她保存生机
But she just used me to save it for herself.

868
01:15:43,770 --> 01:15:46,780
我恐怕也难逃其咎
I'm afraid I bear some responsibility.

869
01:15:46,810 --> 01:15:48,850
我们太狂妄自大了
It was hubris to think

870
01:15:48,880 --> 01:15:52,350
竟以为敌人发现不了我们的秘密
that our secret wouldn't be discovered by the enemy.

871
01:15:52,380 --> 01:15:55,350
我预见到接下来会发生什么
I've seen what comes next.

872
01:15:55,390 --> 01:15:57,460
死亡
Death.

873
01:15:58,960 --> 01:16:02,860
黑巫后会散播新的瘟疫诅咒
The Witch Queen will cast another plague curse.

874
01:16:02,890 --> 01:16:06,830
能散播瘟疫的巫师竟没有被摧毁吗?
Haven't covens with that kind of power been destroyed?

875
01:16:06,870 --> 01:16:08,930
如今我们不摧毁巫师了
We don't destroy witches anymore.

876
01:16:08,970 --> 01:16:11,670
我们囚禁他们
We incarcerate them.

877
01:16:14,310 --> 01:16:16,410
我们把世界上
We took all the most powerful witches

878
01:16:16,440 --> 01:16:17,480
最厉害的巫师们抓起来
that ever walked the Earth

879
01:16:17,510 --> 01:16:19,680
并把他们放在一个地方
and put 'em in one place.

880
01:16:19,710 --> 01:16:21,950
巫师监狱
The witch prison.

881
01:16:21,980 --> 01:16:26,450
他们一直等待着被释放
And they've been waiting, waiting to be released.

882
01:16:26,480 --> 01:16:28,820
等待着复仇
Waiting to exact revenge.

883
01:16:31,590 --> 01:16:33,930
我们创造了完美的巫师团
We created the perfect coven.

884
01:16:35,860 --> 01:16:39,830
现在我又回到了原点
Now I'm right back where I started.

885
01:16:41,800 --> 01:16:44,830
你打败过她一次
You defeated her once.

886
01:16:44,870 --> 01:16:47,770
你一定能再次打败她
You can defeat her again.

887
01:16:47,810 --> 01:16:49,740
卡尔德
Kaulder,

888
01:16:50,940 --> 01:16:52,880
你必须去
you must go.

889
01:16:54,650 --> 01:16:56,610
你必须战斗
You have to fight.

890
01:17:13,470 --> 01:17:15,400
卡尔德
Kaulder.

891
01:17:20,740 --> 01:17:22,870
我从未给它起过名字
I never had a name for it.

892
01:17:24,810 --> 01:17:27,610
但我的敌人管它叫"海克森贝因"
But my enemies came to call it "Hexenbane."

893
01:17:29,050 --> 01:17:31,410
斩巫剑
Witch Slayer.

894
01:17:31,450 --> 01:17:33,250
我也要去
I'm coming, too.

895
01:17:33,290 --> 01:17:35,850
我们的协约是我保证你的安全
Our agreement depended on me keeping you safe.

896
01:17:35,890 --> 01:17:37,690
不 我们的协约是如果我帮助你
No, our agreement was that if I helped you,

897
01:17:37,720 --> 01:17:39,620
你保证我的安全
you'd keep me safe.

898
01:17:39,660 --> 01:17:41,890
如果我现在受伤 它不会自愈的
If I get hurt now, I stay hurt.

899
01:17:41,930 --> 01:17:44,860
你要怎么办?
Where would that leave you?

900
01:17:44,900 --> 01:17:47,400
我才不在乎呢!
You know, I don't care!

901
01:17:47,430 --> 01:17:49,630
谁说巫师不能追杀巫师了?
Who says that a witch can't hunt witches?

902
01:18:06,650 --> 01:18:08,590
克洛伊
Chloe.

903
01:18:09,790 --> 01:18:11,860
卡尔德
Kaulder.

904
01:18:25,570 --> 01:18:27,470
这是什么?
What is this?

905
01:18:27,510 --> 01:18:29,540
瘟疫之树 她就在这里
It's a plague tree. She's here.

906
01:18:29,570 --> 01:18:30,980
咒语完成后
When the spell is done,

907
01:18:31,010 --> 01:18:33,640
蝇群就会被释放
the fly swarm will be released.

908
01:18:33,680 --> 01:18:35,850
我们时间不多了
We haven't much time.

909
01:18:46,690 --> 01:18:48,630
跟紧了
Stay close.

910
01:18:55,900 --> 01:18:58,540
卡尔德 囚犯们都去哪了?
Kaulder, where are the prisoners?

911
01:19:06,580 --> 01:19:08,510
天啊!
My God!

912
01:19:10,980 --> 01:19:13,120
我抓获的每一个巫师
Every witch I ever caught.

913
01:19:13,150 --> 01:19:15,720
都被黑巫后当做了释放瘟疫的力量之源
The Queen's using their power to release the plague.

914
01:19:15,750 --> 01:19:17,360
怎么做到的?
How?

915
01:19:17,390 --> 01:19:19,090
咒颂
The chant.

916
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:20,520
没有巫师能强大到
No witch would be strong enough

917
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:21,790
独自承担这个咒语的作用
to cast this spell alone.

918
01:19:21,830 --> 01:19:23,430
但黑巫后把他们的思想
But the Witch Queen's

919
01:19:23,460 --> 01:19:25,100
像链条一样连接起来了
linking their minds like a chain.

920
01:19:25,130 --> 01:19:27,070
我们该如何阻止他们?
So how do we stop them?

921
01:19:28,570 --> 01:19:30,730
每个链条都有弱点
Every chain has a weak link.

922
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:05,870
- 我来杀死他 - 不要
- I'll do the honors. - No.

923
01:20:05,900 --> 01:20:07,770
我们需要消灭的不是他的肉体
It's not his body we need to destroy.

924
01:20:07,810 --> 01:20:09,840
是他的思想
It's his mind.

925
01:20:11,680 --> 01:20:13,080
但如果他死在了梦中
But if he dies in his dreams,

926
01:20:13,110 --> 01:20:15,010
瘟疫就能被阻止
the plague will be stopped.

927
01:20:15,050 --> 01:20:17,120
我希望还有别的办法
I wish there was another way.

928
01:20:20,650 --> 01:20:22,920
当我回来后你还会在这里 是吧?
You'll still be here when I get back, right?

929
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:28,730
你要和黑巫后单挑 是吗?
You're taking on the Queen alone, aren't you?

930
01:20:28,760 --> 01:20:30,890
这必须有个了结
It has to end.

931
01:20:36,800 --> 01:20:39,470
嘿
Hey.

932
01:20:39,500 --> 01:20:41,240
在里面注意安全
Be careful in there.

933
01:20:42,840 --> 01:20:45,810
你现在又开始关心我了啊?
So are you worried about me then?

934
01:20:45,840 --> 01:20:48,550
我已经习惯你了
Well, I've gotten used to you.

935
01:20:51,150 --> 01:20:52,750
追杀愉快
Good hunting.

936
01:20:52,780 --> 01:20:54,890
你也是
You, too.

937
01:21:26,680 --> 01:21:28,020
守卫
The Sentinel.

938
01:21:28,050 --> 01:21:29,890
不把囚犯关进牢里
And it won't stop until this prisoner

939
01:21:29,920 --> 01:21:33,020
它是不会停的
is put back in his cell.

940
01:21:39,760 --> 01:21:42,200
它是冲着埃里克来的
It's coming for Ellic.

941
01:22:15,270 --> 01:22:17,270
卡尔德?
Kaulder?

942
01:23:35,410 --> 01:23:37,110
如果她出现了受伤的迹象
If there's any sign she's getting hurt in there,

943
01:23:37,150 --> 01:23:38,180
你必须要把她唤醒
you have to wake her up.

944
01:23:38,220 --> 01:23:40,780
向我保证你会把她带到别处
And promise me you'll get her as far away

945
01:23:40,820 --> 01:23:41,880
越远越好
from here as you can.

946
01:23:41,920 --> 01:23:43,250
没问题
Of course.

947
01:24:51,350 --> 01:24:52,660
咒颂停止了
The chanting stopped.

948
01:24:55,460 --> 01:24:57,590
她成功了
She did it.

949
01:25:50,410 --> 01:25:53,750
一个梦行者能为你展示过去
A dream-walker shows your past.

950
01:25:53,780 --> 01:25:56,650
但只有我能向你展示未来
Only I can show the future.

951
01:25:57,950 --> 01:26:01,760
你会失败 人类将要灭绝
You will fail, and humanity will fall.

952
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:10,570
我已经统治世界了
I've taken this world back.

953
01:26:10,600 --> 01:26:12,540
还没有
Not yet.

954
01:26:17,910 --> 01:26:19,910
你能感觉到吗?
Can you feel it?

955
01:26:19,940 --> 01:26:22,610
你的肉体凡胎?
Your mortality?

956
01:26:22,650 --> 01:26:26,220
你的生命正在流逝?
Your life ebbing away?

957
01:27:03,020 --> 01:27:04,960
爸爸!
Father!

958
01:27:09,430 --> 01:27:10,890
卡尔德
Kaulder.

959
01:27:17,030 --> 01:27:19,400
你们是我们世界的入侵者
You are trespassers on our world.

960
01:27:19,440 --> 01:27:21,440
爸爸!
Father!

961
01:27:21,470 --> 01:27:23,310
我从你眼中就能看出来
I've seen it in your eyes.

962
01:27:23,340 --> 01:27:26,410
你渴望死亡
You wish for death.

963
01:27:58,340 --> 01:28:01,480
你知道永生的好处是什么吗?
You know the benefit of eternal life?

964
01:28:01,510 --> 01:28:03,480
就是我能杀死你两次
I get to kill you twice.

965
01:28:04,950 --> 01:28:06,450
住手!
Stop!

966
01:28:06,480 --> 01:28:08,650
卡尔德!
Kaulder!

967
01:28:08,690 --> 01:28:09,990
现在...
Now...

968
01:28:10,020 --> 01:28:11,320
- 克洛伊... - 很抱歉
- Chloe... - I'm sorry.

969
01:28:11,360 --> 01:28:14,060
放走我的皇后
Release my Queen.

970
01:28:14,090 --> 01:28:16,560
在我小时候 你从巫师手中救出了我...
Those witches you rescued me from when I was a kid...

971
01:28:16,590 --> 01:28:19,730
他们没有杀死我父母 他们就是我父母
They didn't kill my parents. They were my parents.

972
01:28:19,760 --> 01:28:21,360
不幸的是 我生来就没有魔法
But sadly, I was born without magic.

973
01:28:21,400 --> 01:28:22,370
你是个巫师
You're a witch.

974
01:28:22,400 --> 01:28:24,330
对
Yep.

975
01:28:25,970 --> 01:28:28,500
- 不要! 不要! - 回来!
- No! No! - Get back here!

976
01:28:30,410 --> 01:28:32,580
离他远点! 放开我!
Get away from him! Let go!

977
01:28:45,490 --> 01:28:47,420
梦行者
Dream-walker.

978
01:29:43,810 --> 01:29:45,450
看看你
Look at you,

979
01:29:45,480 --> 01:29:48,950
真是个肮脏的早晨
you ugly bitch of a morning.

980
01:30:00,660 --> 01:30:02,470
你最后背叛了
You turned against those

981
01:30:02,500 --> 01:30:04,000
你被要求保护的人
you were charged with protecting.

982
01:30:04,030 --> 01:30:05,900
是的 女王陛下
Yes, my Queen.

983
01:30:05,940 --> 01:30:09,070
使我完整 祝我成功
Make me whole. Help me reach my destiny.

984
01:30:09,110 --> 01:30:11,540
赐予我魔法吧
Grant me the gift of magic.

985
01:30:11,570 --> 01:30:14,040
陶土不可能变成黄金
Clay cannot be turned to gold.

986
01:30:14,080 --> 01:30:17,910
没有魔法 你就是一个凡人
Without magic, you're just a human.

987
01:30:45,640 --> 01:30:47,580
父亲?
Father?

988
01:30:52,680 --> 01:30:54,720
亲爱的
My love.

989
01:30:58,250 --> 01:31:00,590
你必须站起来
You must get up.

990
01:31:03,190 --> 01:31:05,800
父亲 你得站起来
Father, you need to get up.

991
01:31:06,830 --> 01:31:08,960
拯救他们
Save them.

992
01:31:15,610 --> 01:31:19,110
去吧 我的爱人 战斗吧
Go, my love. Fight.

993
01:32:00,250 --> 01:32:02,920
你不肯放弃自己可悲的人生
You cling to your pathetic life.

994
01:32:02,950 --> 01:32:04,920
为的是什么?
And for what reason?

995
01:32:06,260 --> 01:32:09,020
最亲近你的人背叛了你
Those closest to you betray you,

996
01:32:09,060 --> 01:32:12,760
你宣称要保护的人们根本不知道你的名字
and those you claim to protect don't even know your name.

997
01:32:15,670 --> 01:32:17,670
以铁
By iron

998
01:32:19,340 --> 01:32:21,570
和火焰之名
and fire!

999
01:33:22,230 --> 01:33:25,900
你倒是用iPad拍死它试试
Try doing that with an iPad.

1000
01:33:38,880 --> 01:33:41,350
卡尔德!
Kaulder!

1001
01:33:41,380 --> 01:33:43,320
卡尔德?
Kaulder?

1002
01:33:48,730 --> 01:33:50,790
卡尔德?
Kaulder?

1003
01:34:27,230 --> 01:34:29,830
只要黑巫后的心脏还在跳动
As long as the Hexen heart beats,

1004
01:34:29,870 --> 01:34:32,300
她就永远不会真正死去
she's never truly dead.

1005
01:34:33,940 --> 01:34:36,340
不 你不能! 你会死的
No, you can't! You'll die.

1006
01:34:37,770 --> 01:34:39,240
我已经准备好接受现实了
I'm ready to face that reality.

1007
01:34:39,280 --> 01:34:42,140
不行! 一定还有别的方法
No! There must be another way.

1008
01:34:42,180 --> 01:34:44,910
听我说
Listen to me.

1009
01:34:44,950 --> 01:34:47,080
当我被拉进阴影时
When I was pulled into the shadows,

1010
01:34:47,120 --> 01:34:50,450
我看到了比她还糟糕的东西
I saw that there were things much worse than her.

1011
01:34:50,490 --> 01:34:53,990
她们在黑暗中 等待着
In the darkness. Waiting.

1012
01:34:54,020 --> 01:34:56,290
等什么?
Waiting for what?

1013
01:34:56,330 --> 01:34:58,290
一个没有你的世界
The world without you.

1014
01:34:59,500 --> 01:35:02,800
我们还需要你
We still need you.

1015
01:35:02,830 --> 01:35:05,170
我需要你
I need you.

1016
01:35:09,270 --> 01:35:12,110
十字斧教背叛了我
The Axe and Cross betrayed me.

1017
01:35:12,140 --> 01:35:13,480
我谁都不能相信
I can't trust anyone.

1018
01:35:13,510 --> 01:35:15,710
你可以相信我
You can trust me.

1019
01:35:18,320 --> 01:35:21,180
这条路我走了800年
800 years I've been on this road.

1020
01:35:26,090 --> 01:35:29,290
终日追杀
Always hunting.

1021
01:35:29,330 --> 01:35:32,390
- 终日... - 独身一人
- Always... - Alone.

1022
01:35:32,430 --> 01:35:34,900
你不会的
You wouldn't be.

1023
01:35:41,440 --> 01:35:44,010
另外
Besides,

1024
01:35:44,040 --> 01:35:47,310
你还欠我五万块钱呢
you still owe me fifty thousand dollars.

1025
01:35:48,480 --> 01:35:50,010
是五千块
Five thousand.

1026
01:35:50,050 --> 01:35:53,180
噢 想讨价还价哈?
Oh. So we're negotiating, then?

1027
01:36:01,420 --> 01:36:03,490
十字斧教会因为黑巫后的心脏
The Axe and Cross would be bothered that

1028
01:36:03,530 --> 01:36:04,760
不再受他们掌控
they're no longer in possession

1029
01:36:04,790 --> 01:36:06,330
而十分烦恼的
of the Queen's heart.

1030
01:36:06,360 --> 01:36:09,200
我以后不为十字斧教效命了
I don't serve The Axe and Cross anymore.

1031
01:36:09,230 --> 01:36:11,200
这次我是为自己活着
This time I do it for me.

1032
01:36:11,230 --> 01:36:13,170
嗯 是时候了
Well, it's about time.

1033
01:36:16,210 --> 01:36:17,470
你知道吗 我曾经觉得
You know, I used to think

1034
01:36:17,510 --> 01:36:20,080
宇宙万物只是无休止的轮回
the universe ran in endless circles,

1035
01:36:20,110 --> 01:36:23,280
永远都在重复自己 永远不出预料
always repeating itself, always predictable.

1036
01:36:24,850 --> 01:36:26,780
现在呢?
And now?

1037
01:36:28,580 --> 01:36:31,990
我不知道下一步会发生什么
I don't know what happens next.

1038
01:36:32,020 --> 01:36:35,260
你知道我们凡人管它叫什么吗?
Do you know what we mortals call that?

1039
01:36:35,290 --> 01:36:37,290
生活
Living.

1040
01:36:42,500 --> 01:36:45,070
知道吗
You know,

1041
01:36:45,100 --> 01:36:48,040
我还是需要你
I still need you.

1042
01:36:48,070 --> 01:36:50,270
那好
Well, then

1043
01:36:50,310 --> 01:36:52,480
愿意为您服务
I'm at your service.

1044
01:36:54,910 --> 01:36:57,450
来吧 你又不会变年轻
Come on. You're not getting any younger.

1045
01:37:01,080 --> 01:37:03,320
所以你准备好出发了还是怎么?
So you ready to go, or what?

1046
01:37:05,060 --> 01:37:06,990
我开车
I'm driving.

1047
01:37:10,290 --> 01:37:12,460
好
Okay.
