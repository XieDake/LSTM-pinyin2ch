别误会  我来这只是想谈谈
What's up with you guys?

00:03:41,390 --> 00:03:45,700
大家一起谈谈  把误会都解开
It ain't like I come to visit everyday, And this is the way you treat me?

20
00:03:45,710 --> 00:03:48,750
好了  现在滚开  他现在不在所以没得谈
Go away K2, there isn't time to get friendly. Come back later.

21
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:52,020
你下次再来吧  我们告诉他你来过了
When the boss gets back, I'll let him know you came by.

22

Alright boys. You got a piece of paper so I can leave him my number?

23
00:03:58,490 --> 00:04:01,920
算了我写墙上  这样不容易丢
No? I'll write it on the wall, It won't go missing.

24
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:03,850
这墙上不许写
The wall is off limits.

25
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:05,850
哦我忘了  这的房东
I totally forgot, property of the owner.

26

是"干净"先生
He lives like a real gangster.

27
00:04:07,510 --> 00:04:11,410
你们老大还真是做大生意的
And you're justjealousthat it ain't your yard.

28

不扯了  这号码我写哪?
So where the fuck can I leave my number?

30
00:04:19,350 --> 00:04:21,210
写你手上
Gimme your hand.

31

Don't get scared! If I wanted to kill you, I would've done it a long time ago.

你的兄弟们全副武装  我就一支笔
Armed to the teeth, san scared of a pen.

33
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:31,850
别担心  我会轻轻地写
Chill; relax. I don't bite.

34
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:33,860
你找雷托有什么事?
What do you want from Leito?

35
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:38,200
他拿了我些东西  只是想要回来
He's got my things. I just came to collect them.

36
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:48,320
写好了  留在这不容易被洗掉了

塔依克  我们握一下  你看我们能合作
Gimme some skin.  Like an oath.

40
00:04:58,970 --> 00:05:01,970
真是个照相的好机会
Shame, if you had a camera, we could've had a picture.

一起笑一下
Smile, watch.

I like fast rides.

46
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:37,960

Come here.

47
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:11,210
-问一下楼下  有人上来了  -你自己不能问
-Yo, the lift's moving. Radio them.  -You do it.

48
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:13,830
塔依克  是谁上来了?
Tarik, who's that coming in the lift?

49
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,840
塔依克!  这鬼东西又坏了
Tarik! Shit it's fucked again.

50
00:06:19,470 --> 00:06:20,840
注意点  有人上来了
What do we do?

51
00:06:21,020 --> 00:06:23,840
别吵  这集不看  明天的我就跟不上了
Don't stress, man! This film is wicked.

52
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:27,010
塔依克  下面到底怎么回事?
Tarik, what the fuck is going on?

53
00:06:27,390 --> 00:06:29,270
塔依克!
Tarik!

帮我调一下天线
Arghh not now. Fix the aerial.

55
00:06:33,650 --> 00:06:37,020
哎!  我不是你小弟!  自己调!
I ain't your bitch!  Fix it yourself, you lazy dumb fuck!

56
00:06:37,190 --> 00:06:40,360
塔依克  他妈的回答
Tarik, can you hear me?

57
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:49,690
真他妈的烦  可能是送饭的上来了
Why are you so stressed? He's probably bringing us our dinner.

58
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:52,050
送饭的提前一小时?  这还是头一次
Dinner, an hour early? Something ain't right.

59
00:06:52,060 --> 00:06:54,500
不用这么担心
Well I'm not a pessimist like you.

60
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:08,250
雷托住哪  你可能知道房间号吧  伙计?
We're looking for Leito, What number is he at?

61
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:11,430
-14号  -谢了
-14.  -Cheers.

62
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,820
靠  这门上就没有号!
Shit, the doors aren't numbered!

63
00:07:31,830 --> 00:07:34,790
把所有的门都给我砸开!
Bust all the doors down.

64
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,870
-雷托在哪?  -他不在这
-Where is Leito?  -Well he ain't here.

-靠 那你告诉我在哪!  -楼道尽头左手边的就是
-I know that, but fucking where?  -Along the corridor, last door on the left.

00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:55,230
你也一起来吧  我不太相信你
You're coming with me, so I don't get lost.

67

走右边
Turn right!

68
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:07,910

00:08:10,410 --> 00:08:12,910
第三个门就是
Third door.

70
00:08:18,750 --> 00:08:22,700
靠  你想害死我?  老大要活的
Do you wish me dead? I want him alive.

71
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:25,010
大家都清楚了?
Is that clear to you all?

72
00:08:27,090 --> 00:08:29,050
撞开它
Move.

73

76
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,760
去抓住他!
He's at the bottom.

77
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:41,120
他上了屋顶!
He's on the roof.

78
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:46,800
这个混蛋!
Motherfucker.

79
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:54,470
他在那!
There he his!

80
00:11:18,510 --> 00:11:20,390
废物!
Fuck!

81
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:42,180
早上8点搞来的20公斤货
Let's think... At 8:00 he stole 20kg of heroin from you.

82
00:11:42,190 --> 00:11:45,700
才9点你们就他妈的搞丢了  你们去了多少人
You found out who did it at 9.00... How many of you went to pay him a visit?

83
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:46,380
到底多少人?
How many guys?

84
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,730
十二个
12 guys.

85
00:11:47,830 --> 00:11:51,290
哦去了十二个  结果屁都没拿回来?
12 guys. And you all came back empty handed?

86
00:11:51,300 --> 00:11:52,820
又搞砸了?
That's cool?

87
00:11:52,830 --> 00:11:55,830
我们本来能干掉他  但你要活的...
We could've killed him about 100 times. But you want him alive...

88
00:11:55,880 --> 00:11:58,210
说的好  是我的错?
Are you saying its now somehow my fault?

89
00:11:58,220 --> 00:12:00,810
我不是这意思老大...那小子跑起来像块肥皂
Nah, I'm not trying to say that.  It's just that he's so slippery. Soap bar.

90
00:12:00,820 --> 00:12:04,690
哦  像块肥皂?
Slippery, like a soap bar?

91
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:05,680
是的  老大
Yeah.

92
00:12:05,690 --> 00:12:08,720
让我们算算帐  50元一克  一共20公斤
�50 for a gram, times 20 kilos.

93
00:12:08,820 --> 00:12:11,630
我给你们算好了  100万欧元
That's a million euro.

94
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:14,440
这块肥皂挺他妈的贵  你们说呢?
That's one expensive soap bar.

95
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:19,230
好吧  你们说说怎么搞定
Well then. I'm waiting for your proposal?

96
00:12:19,240 --> 00:12:21,740
有人能给我出个主意吗?
Has anyone got a proposal?

97
00:12:30,090 --> 00:12:31,750
别这样!
No, no need!

98
00:12:31,960 --> 00:12:34,040
我  我有办法
I've got a proposal.

99
00:12:34,050 --> 00:12:37,170
这样就好嘛!
K2, fantastic! I'm all ears.

100
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:40,940
是雷托毁了那些货  那就让他交这100万好了
Well Leito stole our drugs so...he's gotta pay, right?

101
00:12:40,950 --> 00:12:44,270
这是什么鸟办法  你在做白日梦?
That is not a proposition, merely stating the obvious.

102
00:12:44,280 --> 00:12:46,980
-等下!  -说吧
-Hold on, Wait!  -I'm waiting!

103
00:12:47,190 --> 00:12:51,560
他有个妹妹罗拉 在附近一家超市工作
His sister, Lola, she works in a nearby supermarket.

104
00:12:51,570 --> 00:12:55,360
我们把她抓住  他就得乖乖出来了
We grab her and he comes to us.

105
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:59,320
你看  你还是能想出办法的嘛  把她带来
You see that? That's a good proposal. Bring her here.

106
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:14,710
不好意思
Back in a minute.

107
00:13:31,810 --> 00:13:34,610
走吧  老板要见你
Come on, the manager wants you.

108
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:37,110
我告诉你  老板要找你谈
Let's go, are you deaf? They are calling you.

109
00:13:37,520 --> 00:13:38,030
老板星期二从来不在
The boss isn't in on a Wednesday.

110
00:13:38,130 --> 00:13:39,940
不是你这鬼地方的老板
What has the boss got to do with this?

111
00:13:40,040 --> 00:13:41,610
我的老板  塔哈
My boss is waiting for you, Taha.

112
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:44,790
塔哈?  我才不管他是谁的老板
Taha is not my boss.

113
00:13:45,580 --> 00:13:48,540
放开我混蛋
Let go, bastard.

114
00:13:49,750 --> 00:13:52,710
你这个猪猡!
You big animal!

115
00:13:59,970 --> 00:14:01,840
我今天真他妈的不顺!
Move bitch.

116
00:15:02,950 --> 00:15:05,660
嘿这妞是给我的礼物吗?
Oh, a present?

117
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,690
我喜欢这妞  正适合我小弟
I can take care of her, we can make it work.

118
00:15:08,790 --> 00:15:10,790
-闪开点!  -我来给她搜搜身
-Hands off!  -Can I search her?

119
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,030
你肯定搞过吧  她是个小女孩
I already did, she's clean.

120
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:14,940
别这样  把你的小内裤给我
Let me take a peek at her panties.

121
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:17,410
我出来时让你把它吃下去
I'll stuff them down your throat!

122
00:15:17,480 --> 00:15:20,460
那最好  小妞  我嘴里可不少
If you want too, I'm getting excited.

123
00:15:20,470 --> 00:15:22,960
靠  你这混蛋
Here's a taste.

124
00:15:22,970 --> 00:15:25,880
你给我滚开  她是给塔哈的
Fuck off man, Taha is waiting for her.

125
00:15:25,890 --> 00:15:28,680
你别再惹事了
Stop struggling, you'll hurt yourself.

126
00:15:40,280 --> 00:15:41,310
是我
It's me.

127
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:47,660
K2在门口
K2 at the door.

128
00:15:50,910 --> 00:15:54,080
你又搞砸了?
He's come back with more excuses?

129
00:15:55,290 --> 00:15:57,370
干的好  上来吧
You can come in.

130
00:15:57,380 --> 00:16:01,380
现在要让雷托知道他妹妹在我们手上  你去传话
Inform Leito that I got his sister.

131
00:16:02,170 --> 00:16:06,180
我真想看看他知道消息时脸上的表情
I'd like to see his face when he finds out.

132
00:16:07,600 --> 00:16:12,420
我就在这  有点吃惊吧  现在就一刀杀了你!
Well here it is. Trust me, I'll put an end to your plans!

133
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:16,040
你杀了我  外面的人会把你撕碎的
If anything happens to me, your situation is not gonna get better.

134
00:16:16,050 --> 00:16:17,600
这可不是个好主意  你想怎么样?
What do you want?

135
00:16:17,610 --> 00:16:19,480
你看  这就是我们两个不同之处
Do you know what makes us different?

136
00:16:19,580 --> 00:16:23,390
你不知道我要干什么  可我却知道你那些所谓的生意
You don't know what I'm thinking. And me, I know your every move.

137
00:16:23,490 --> 00:16:26,240
所以你总是比我慢一拍
That's why I'm always one step ahead.

138
00:16:26,990 --> 00:16:31,500
K2别动  大家可以慢慢谈  冷静点
Relax, K2, it's cool. Just chatting, calm down.

139
00:16:31,510 --> 00:16:32,610
是啊  大家谈谈
We got a lot to chat about.

140
00:16:32,620 --> 00:16:36,710
别那么使劲抓我头发  告诉我你想怎么样!
You can stop stroking my hair. Just let me know what you want!

141
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:39,160
-两件事  -说吧
-Two things.  -I'm listening.

142
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:42,460
不要再到我那捣乱  那楼附近不许你卖白粉
Your people will not come within a half kilometre of my house.

143
00:16:43,260 --> 00:16:45,330
好的  第二呢?
Deal. And the second?

144
00:16:45,340 --> 00:16:48,930
想活  就让我妹妹走
Your life for the life of my sister.

145
00:16:49,100 --> 00:16:52,910
我放开你  你的人不许动  让我们走
I let you go and we both walk. Your men stay here.

146
00:16:53,120 --> 00:16:53,830
这算是交易吗?
You're a businessman, right?

147
00:16:54,020 --> 00:16:54,630
你觉得呢
Talk!

148
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:56,840
好的  成交
All right, I've got nothing against.

149
00:16:57,040 --> 00:16:57,840
你保证?
You give your word?

150
00:16:57,850 --> 00:17:00,560
-当然  -现在开始吧
-That's right?  -For the moment.

151
00:17:00,570 --> 00:17:03,070
K2  让她走
K2, let her go.

152
00:17:03,280 --> 00:17:07,490
K2照我说的做
Do it, don't think about it!

153
00:17:07,660 --> 00:17:10,700
你自己趴到地上  还是我给你一脚!
Are you gonna lie down, or do you need help?

154
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:18,740
行了  我做到了  你妹妹就在那
OK, I kept my word. She's free.

155
00:17:18,750 --> 00:17:22,090
-现在你放开我  -再等一会
-Put the knife down.  -Don't worry.

156
00:17:25,380 --> 00:17:27,340
你觉得能从这出去吗?
Do you think you're gonna get out of here with me?

157
00:17:27,350 --> 00:17:30,300
这都是你的好兄弟?
What makes you think that everybody here likes you?

158
00:17:31,010 --> 00:17:33,630
大家听着  我和他作笔交易
Listen up, boys. We've finished talking.

159
00:17:33,640 --> 00:17:36,160
让他出去  大家都没事
They are leaving and nobody else leaves.

160
00:17:36,170 --> 00:17:39,690
大家都别动  很快就好
Don't try and shoot. I'll be right back.

161
00:17:52,490 --> 00:17:54,370
等一下!
Wait!

162
00:18:03,340 --> 00:18:05,840
张开嘴
Open your mouth.

163
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:12,300
想吃就多加一个
Now chew.

164
00:18:12,510 --> 00:18:14,680
你妹挺有个性的
I like your sister's style.

165
00:18:14,790 --> 00:18:16,770
闭嘴  继续走
Shut the fuck up, and move.

166
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,240
拿开那玩意  这边快点
Gimme it, take it.

167
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:36,600
大家冷静  我们带来个人
Easy, don't shoot. We're gonna deliver our client.

168
00:19:38,850 --> 00:19:41,560
我要见警长
Call the Chief!

169
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:47,520
好吧  我们先进去
Let us pass, before it's too late.

170
00:20:03,250 --> 00:20:05,750
他妈的
Shit.

171
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:08,360
嗨  你们有什么事外面谈吧
Can't you two talk things over?

172
00:20:08,560 --> 00:20:09,630
我们这正要关门
We are slowly packing up.

173
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:11,230
这是塔哈・本玛乌
This is Taha. Taha Bemamud.

174
00:20:11,430 --> 00:20:12,820
你们不是有一堆案子指控他吗?
He's got a thousand warrants out for him.

175
00:20:12,930 --> 00:20:14,640
我当然知道  不过现在我们得关门了
I know him well, but we are still leaving.

176
00:20:14,650 --> 00:20:18,760
上面的意思是必须得有证据  否则我也没办法
Orders from the Ministry. Plus I need solid evidence.

177
00:20:19,680 --> 00:20:24,180
5公斤白粉  两个证人  这还不够?!
5 kilos of heroin from his office and 2 witnesses should be enough!

178
00:20:36,990 --> 00:20:39,200
外面来了很多他们的人
Chief, there are too many of them.

179
00:20:39,300 --> 00:20:41,200
火力比我们多三倍
They are three times stronger than our forces.

180
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:44,850
好吧  就像你说的
All right, we will take this to court.

181
00:20:44,950 --> 00:20:46,850
先给我你的武器
You can hand in your weapons now.

182
00:20:46,860 --> 00:20:48,400
你们  看好塔哈
Somebody keep guard on him.

183
00:20:48,410 --> 00:20:51,790
真不幸雷托  你以为他们真能把我送进监狱?
Poor Leito, so naive. You think this will change anything?

184
00:20:51,800 --> 00:20:55,050
也许不能  不过这是个好的开始
This will be a lesson for the rest of them.

185
00:20:55,340 --> 00:20:57,830
为了省点时间  书面程序就省了
I don't need useless court cases.

186
00:20:58,020 --> 00:21:00,830
现在你进那个小铁房  塔哈拿着你的货从这滚吧!
Put him in a cell and you can go.

187
00:21:00,930 --> 00:21:03,300
你不能这样!  他会更加肆无忌惮的
Don't let him go. You have no idea what will happen now.

188
00:21:03,310 --> 00:21:06,530
谁在乎  那时我们早就远走高飞了
I don't care what's gonna happen here, we are already leaving.

189
00:21:06,540 --> 00:21:10,830
制止这些人是你的职责!
It's your job to end this nightmare in our neighborhood!

190
00:21:11,150 --> 00:21:13,610
你还没搞懂情况!  没看见这高墙和工事!
You still don't get it! This area is surrounded by walls and barbed wire.

191
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:16,400
他们要把这全炸上天
They've covered it from the top and it will be destroyed.

192
00:21:16,500 --> 00:21:18,400
再也不用制止谁了  一切都结束了
Then this whole nightmare will end.

193
00:21:18,410 --> 00:21:20,440
算你走运待在这里面
Be glad you're in this cell.

194
00:21:20,540 --> 00:21:22,440
外面那些家伙可都想冲进来干掉你
Outside, a band of zombies is waiting for your blood.

195
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:24,230
你怎么还不走?
Taha, your still here?

196
00:21:24,330 --> 00:21:28,280
我这么出去没法向我手下解释
My band of zombies could teach you a thing or two, chief.

197
00:21:28,290 --> 00:21:32,590
别找事塔哈 你跟你的货都没事  你还想怎样?
Don't start, Taha. You're free, what else do you want?

198
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:35,590
-那个姑娘  -不!
-The girl.  -No!

199
00:21:39,140 --> 00:21:40,890
-好吧  快滚吧  -不
-Take her.  -No!

200
00:21:40,900 --> 00:21:44,060
我警告你  如果你敢碰我...
Try a touch her.

201
00:21:44,560 --> 00:21:49,140
-劳拉  劳拉!  -别担心  我会好好照顾她的
-Lola! Lola!  -Don't worry, I'll take care of her.

202
00:21:49,150 --> 00:21:52,890
先生们  非常荣幸一起共事
Gentlemen, it's always a pleasure doing business.

203
00:21:52,900 --> 00:21:54,770
再会
Goodbye.

204
00:21:54,780 --> 00:21:58,990
不!  不要!
No! Noo!

205
00:22:08,750 --> 00:22:13,630
把她绑在我办公室里  给她磕点粉让她安静点
Take her to my office. Inject her with a couple of doses to calm her down.

206
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:18,170
没事了  都回去工作吧
Don't stand around, get to work lads.

207
00:22:22,300 --> 00:22:24,810
我是逼不得已
I didn't have a choice.

208
00:22:25,430 --> 00:22:28,680
我在这个区15年了
I've spent 15 years in this neighborhood.

209
00:22:29,390 --> 00:22:33,350
今晚结束就退休了  不想再找事了
My pension's coming up and I want to end this.

210
00:22:33,360 --> 00:22:37,940
很抱歉  对你和你妹妹
I'd like it differently, Sorry.

211
00:22:38,990 --> 00:22:42,570
她  我会去救  你  下地狱吧!
You gave away my sister This is the end for you.

212
00:22:46,290 --> 00:22:49,870
六个月后
6 months later.

213
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:01,110
告诉我佩德罗  你不喜欢我的车?
Tell me Pedro, what has that door done to you?

214
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:03,940
-我不叫佩德罗  -我不管你叫什么
-I'm not Pedro.  -Who gives a fuck what your name is?

215
00:23:03,950 --> 00:23:05,710
我现在说的是车  我的车
That's my car dumb-ass.

216
00:23:05,720 --> 00:23:09,470
我实在受不了  你这个笨手笨脚的白痴
What if I hit your stupid head with the same force?

217
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:13,430
-只是辆车而已  -谁说只是辆车
-It's only a car.  -Not only a car.

218
00:23:13,440 --> 00:23:15,300
这车是我的!
It's my fucking car!

219
00:23:15,310 --> 00:23:17,810
这是我的财产!
It cost me money!

220
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:23,860
现在对我的车好一点  不然你会死的很惨
So be careful with my car, or I'll crack your head open.

221
00:23:23,870 --> 00:23:28,030
-明白了吗?  -算了吧  他没别的意思
-Do you understand?  -Carlos, don't worry, let's just go.

222
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:32,200
他总是招人烦  我实在受不了这些不懂规矩的小混混
Stupid son of a bitch. These latinos have no respect for anything.

223
00:23:32,210 --> 00:23:34,700
轻点关门有那么难吗?
Is it so difficult to shut a car door gently?

224
00:23:34,710 --> 00:23:38,580
好了他知道错了  以后会好好地对你的车的  对吧佩德罗
He understood. He'll be more gentle. He's the driver, right Pedro?

225
00:23:38,590 --> 00:23:41,580
-我不叫佩德罗  -还有就是这该死的门
-I'm not Pedro.  -That's why all the doors squeak.

226
00:23:41,590 --> 00:23:45,960
我花了一大笔修理费  结果这门还是他妈的吱呀地响
I spent about 1,5 on that shit and they still squeak.

227
00:23:45,970 --> 00:23:49,970
我搞定你这门  我保证
I'll take care of it, Carlos. You have my word.

228
00:23:51,180 --> 00:23:53,040
我们要把招小弟的规矩改一改
We have a bad team selection, Time to change.

229
00:23:53,740 --> 00:23:55,350
和弗兰克说说这事
We need to have a word with Franco.

230
00:23:55,370 --> 00:23:58,060
-好的  -不要在找这种葡萄牙人了
-Ok.  -Because they keep sending us these fucking Portugese.

231
00:23:58,070 --> 00:23:59,900
都是些傻蛋
Thick as shit, Useless fuckers.

232
00:23:59,910 --> 00:24:02,960
别担心  我会去找弗兰克搞定
I'll speak to Franco. We'll sort everything out.

233
00:24:02,970 --> 00:24:05,630
我要手下的都有些教育水平
For fucks sake! I need 2 well educated guys.

234
00:24:05,640 --> 00:24:07,990
找些名牌学校的
We need to grab them straight from Uni.

235
00:24:08,090 --> 00:24:10,990
那些硕士毕业了不也整天在街上晃
These fuckers don't even know what a school is.

236
00:24:11,000 --> 00:24:15,370
贝尼托  现在法国有六百万失业人口
Benito, in France there are 6 million people unemployed.

237
00:24:15,380 --> 00:24:17,660
找到几个不是很难吧
Just find me 2 normal guys.

238
00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:20,580
没问题  这事我去办
No problem, I'll get on to it.

239
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:23,170
你等我给你开门?
Do I have to get the door myself?

240
00:24:24,340 --> 00:24:26,220
这就对了
This is what I'm saying.

241
00:24:42,070 --> 00:24:44,570
5号是赢家
Number 5 is the winner!

242
00:24:45,610 --> 00:24:47,060
下注
Place your bets.

243
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:50,610
-没忘记吧  -放心

244
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:53,320
这周末还  我保证
At the end of the week, as promised.

245
00:24:53,330 --> 00:24:57,700
他妈的  那老东西真恶心
He really hit the bottom, no shame or conscience.

246
00:24:57,710 --> 00:25:01,040
别忘了提醒他欠我们多少钱
He owes us big money, yet he has the balls to show his face here.

247
00:25:01,050 --> 00:25:05,050
现在人都他妈少教育
A lack of a proper upbringing. Tactless.

248
00:25:05,630 --> 00:25:07,720
跟着我
Follow me.

249
00:25:10,640 --> 00:25:12,930
盯着点!
How's things, Ragbi.

250
00:25:17,730 --> 00:25:20,550
-怎么样  萨米?  -有点不太对头
-Everything alright, Sam?  -Well, not at the moment.

251
00:25:20,560 --> 00:25:22,730
哦  又怎么了?
What's the matter?

252
00:25:23,570 --> 00:25:26,060
有警察?
Problems with the police again?

253
00:25:26,160 --> 00:25:27,830
这两个在那站了一个小时了
These two have been standing there for two hours.

254
00:25:27,930 --> 00:25:29,510
就买了一罐金枪鱼
Choosing a tin of tuna.

255
00:25:29,610 --> 00:25:30,830
没事的
They're pimps.

256
00:25:31,090 --> 00:25:32,890
那他们在在食品档干什么?
Pimps? So what are they doing in the fish section?

257
00:25:32,900 --> 00:25:34,330
大概在那消磨时间
Nothing. There waiting until 2:00.

258
00:25:34,630 --> 00:25:37,440
没看到这有台咖啡机吗?
That's when the whores have a coffee break.

259
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:40,740
你们凌晨1点10分进来的
You arrive at 1.10 and presto.

260
00:25:40,750 --> 00:25:43,250
看看之后的情况
What's been happening on the streets.

261
00:25:44,630 --> 00:25:45,830
这他妈的怎么回事?
Who the fuck is that?

262
00:25:45,980 --> 00:25:48,490
我可不认为他们是为了一盒罐头
Pimps, but not after tinned tuna.

263
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:50,470
还有别的可疑吗?
What else?

264
00:25:50,570 --> 00:25:52,380
常客几乎都不在 就跟商量好了一样
There aren't that many, but its like someone's informed them.

265
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:55,600
更巧的是  今天我们交割现金
At the same time, when we move the cash.

266
00:25:55,680 --> 00:25:56,830
这说明什么?
What you saying?

267
00:25:56,930 --> 00:26:02,880
这么大一笔钱能让任何人出卖我们  甚至还能得到10%的酬金
500,000 straight up. Crazy sum.

268
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:06,420
-你怎么知道?  -因为有人给我出过价
-How do you know?  -It's my job.

269
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:07,830
那你为什么没干?
So why didn't you take it?

270
00:26:07,950 --> 00:26:09,760
我怎么知道那人是不是警察?
How was I to know if they were really cops?

271
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:13,330
你挺聪明呀!
You little shit!

272
00:26:13,430 --> 00:26:14,240
这是迫不得已
Do you want to live?

273
00:26:14,340 --> 00:26:16,260
这倒是真的  你上过大学吧?
Of course. Have you finished my studies?

274
00:26:16,270 --> 00:26:18,330
经济学  硕士毕业
Yes, with honours.

275
00:26:18,430 --> 00:26:22,780
看到了吧  这就是差距
You understand, you see the difference?

276
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:27,790
你觉的我们的人有问题  是吗?
So you think we have a snitch?

277
00:26:27,800 --> 00:26:30,300
你觉得呢?
Without a doubt.

278
00:26:42,190 --> 00:26:46,350
-我就觉得有些不对劲  这个佩德罗  -他不叫佩德罗
-I could sense that there was something about Pedro.  -It wasn't Pedro.

279
00:26:46,360 --> 00:26:49,620
我才不管他叫什么  老子没时间跟他玩了
I don't a give a shit. We are not about to start crying.

280
00:26:49,630 --> 00:26:52,610
好了  带上钱我们走
We need to take the cash and ourselves outta here.

281
00:26:52,620 --> 00:26:55,110
谁也不能走了  把钱都放下  把手举起来
Don't move. Leave the money and put your hands in the air!

282
00:26:55,120 --> 00:26:58,810
-你他妈的干什么?  -我不叫贝尼托  我叫达绵
-Benito, what's with you?  -I'm not Benito but Damien.

283
00:26:58,820 --> 00:27:02,410
卡洛司-蒙托亚第一行动小组  你被捕了
Criminal police. Carlos Montoya, you're under arrest.

284
00:27:02,420 --> 00:27:05,380
-贝尼托你是警察?  -你有权利保持沉默
-Benito, you're bald?  -You have the right to remain silent,

285
00:27:05,390 --> 00:27:08,250
但所有你说的话都可能成为呈堂证供
anything you say might be used against you in a court of law.

286
00:27:08,260 --> 00:27:11,790
任何错误的举动都将被认为是拒捕
Any sudden movement will be interpreted as aggression.

287
00:27:11,800 --> 00:27:14,330
都可能引起警员进行正当防卫
And I will have to use my gun in self-defence.

288
00:27:14,340 --> 00:27:15,910
你他妈在说什么?
What are you saying?

289
00:27:16,010 --> 00:27:17,320
我说你要再动一下...
If you as much as move your ear...

290
00:27:17,420 --> 00:27:18,800
我就要你的命!
I will paint this room red.

291
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:21,810
不错  不过你以为你出得去吗?
Understood, but how do you plan to leave this room?

292
00:27:21,810 --> 00:27:26,690
其他人先出去  我们俩待一会  萨米  带着你的人先出去
We stay. Alone; tell your people to leave.

293
00:27:37,240 --> 00:27:39,820
为什么你让他们走了?
Why are you letting them go?

294
00:27:39,920 --> 00:27:41,730
你才是我们想要的
I only catch the big ones.

295
00:27:41,830 --> 00:27:43,950
卡玫隆  我准备好了
Hamilion in place, begin extraction.

296
00:27:44,050 --> 00:27:46,250
收到  马上就好
Copy that Hamilion, commencing.

297
00:27:50,800 --> 00:27:53,080
-我们怎么办?  -你为什么问我?
-What do we do?  -Why are you asking me?

298
00:27:53,090 --> 00:27:56,470
-你是高才生  -靠 我可没学过这个
-You're a model student.  -They didn't teach me this.

299
00:28:04,980 --> 00:28:07,060
什么东西?
What in the devil is that?

300
00:28:11,440 --> 00:28:14,330
-还好?  没吓着吧  -我还行
-You didn't get hit did you?  -No, I'm ok.

301
00:28:14,340 --> 00:28:16,450
那就最好
Ok, that's good.

302
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:25,250
-卡玫隆  包裹已经打好了  -好  我们开始
-Package ready.  -Copy that, thanks.

303
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:32,710
没什么  请大家离开
All exits covered.

304
00:28:42,520 --> 00:28:45,230
里面现在怎么样?
What now, Einstein?

305
00:28:52,110 --> 00:28:55,280
你们快点  我这顶不住了
Quickly, there is gonna be a lot of heat soon.

306
00:29:11,710 --> 00:29:13,800
快放下来
Lower the line.

307
00:29:20,260 --> 00:29:23,060
给我几个弹夹  我另想办法
I'm all out of bullets.

308
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:52,670
他们没拿钱  我们分了它  去关上门
They didn't take the money. We can split it, close the door.

309
00:32:24,610 --> 00:32:27,570
去吧  该你们了
Ok guys, now it's your turn.

310
00:32:29,620 --> 00:32:32,000
你还真有眼色
Where were you earlier?

311
00:32:38,800 --> 00:32:40,430
伙计们  我们上
Come on men, forward!

312
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:43,380
大家请过来这边
There you go, help yourself.

313
00:32:44,840 --> 00:32:47,750
快来  过这边来!
Don't resist!

314
00:32:47,760 --> 00:32:49,420
干的好  伙计
Excellent work.

315
00:32:54,020 --> 00:32:58,390
-上尉?  -你他妈的该死的警察!
-Captain?  -I've never met such a crook.

316
00:32:58,400 --> 00:33:00,680
要是告诉我妈  她一定会高兴
That's good. Thanks for the compliment.

317
00:33:00,690 --> 00:33:03,600
-我把你当成兄弟  -兄弟?
-I trusted you like my brother.  -A brother?

318
00:33:03,610 --> 00:33:07,020
我围着你的鸟车洗了整整六个月
I had to wash your car for 6 months before you gave me a job.

319
00:33:07,030 --> 00:33:10,120
还有就是那见鬼的车门
And before I forget...Your doors.

320
00:33:21,130 --> 00:33:24,870
这下它不会再响了
That's the squeaking sorted out. Like I promised.

321
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:28,970
-托玛索上尉来了  -让他进来
-Captain Damien, Chief.  -Show him in.

322
00:33:31,140 --> 00:33:35,260
你好达绵  祝贺你昨晚的行动非常成功
Good morning, Damien. I've called you in to congratulate you,

323
00:33:35,270 --> 00:33:38,640
不过我们又有件棘手的事  先坐下吧
but the situation has slightly changed. Sit.

324
00:33:38,650 --> 00:33:41,530
-我还是比较喜欢站着  -那好吧
-I prefer to stand if that's all right?  -As you please.

325
00:33:41,540 --> 00:33:44,220
这是库戈先生  国防部安全秘书
Let me introduce Mr.Krüger, the Defence Secretary.

326
00:33:44,230 --> 00:33:46,560
还有他的副手  科西尼先生
And Mr.Corsini, his 2nd in command.

327
00:33:46,570 --> 00:33:49,900
我们需要你执行一个特殊任务
They are looking for someone to take on a special mission.

328
00:33:49,910 --> 00:33:53,320
库戈先生  您说一下情况吧
Mr.Krüger, please explain the situation to the Captain.

329
00:33:53,330 --> 00:33:57,570
昨天下午我们运送一些特殊货物时
Late last night we were transporting equipment in an armored truck,

330
00:33:57,580 --> 00:34:00,740
发生了意外
which ran into some problems along the way.

331
00:34:00,750 --> 00:34:03,110
不要  不需要!
What the hell, no need for that!

332
00:34:03,210 --> 00:34:04,910
走开  你们搞得我什么都看不见了
Careful, you're gonna scratch the glass.

333
00:34:04,920 --> 00:34:07,220
靠!
Stubborn little shits!

334
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:12,010
还在搞什么?
Oh, this is just great!

335
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:22,980
好消息是那车有追踪系统  我们知道它在哪
Luckily the truck has a homing device, so we know its location.

336
00:34:22,990 --> 00:34:24,810
但需要你把它拿回来
We need your help to retrieve it.

337
00:34:24,820 --> 00:34:27,110
在哪?
Where is it?

338
00:34:39,790 --> 00:34:42,080
车里装着什么?
And what's the equipment?

339
00:34:45,420 --> 00:34:47,080
这是什么鬼玩意
What exactly?

340
00:34:47,090 --> 00:34:50,140
一种新型核弹
Nuclear-organic bomb, experimental model.

341
00:34:50,150 --> 00:34:53,540
清洁炸弹  总之是一种中子技术
A so-called "clean bomb" built around neutron technology.

342
00:34:53,550 --> 00:34:54,980
爆炸范围8公里
Blast radius of 8km.

343
00:34:54,990 --> 00:34:58,200
放射持续时间很短  而且能很快被吸收掉
The fall-out area can be replanted almost immediately.

344
00:34:58,210 --> 00:34:59,930
不会污染我们的大气
Contamination of the environment is nil.

345
00:34:59,940 --> 00:35:02,940
您怕他们动了那玩意
Are you scared that they will use the bomb on you?

346
00:35:04,190 --> 00:35:08,140
要是用到市中心  就不会很干净了
The Eliseye Fields is not the ideal place for the bomb.

347
00:35:08,150 --> 00:35:09,460
这一点  我们都清楚
Not ideal, I agree.

348
00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:10,830
问题是...
There is one more thing...

349
00:35:11,000 --> 00:35:13,900
这炸弹装有一个时间控制器  24小时就自动启动
If tampered with, the bomb will self-destruct in 24 hours.

350
00:35:13,910 --> 00:35:17,760
更不幸的是  这东西一小时前已经被触发了
Unfortunately, the self-destruct system was activated over an hour ago.

351
00:35:17,770 --> 00:35:20,660
-那么再过23小时...  -必炸无疑
-In 23 hours... -It will explode.

352
00:35:20,670 --> 00:35:22,320
-K2?  -是
-K2?  -What?

353
00:35:22,330 --> 00:35:25,040
我给你23小时  把这东西卖了
You have to sell it to someone.

354
00:35:27,130 --> 00:35:29,620
我干不来  时间太短
I can't help. There is not enough time.

355
00:35:29,630 --> 00:35:33,790
上尉  这不是在征求你的意见  这是命令
Captain, we are not asking, just explaining.

356
00:35:33,800 --> 00:35:35,650
你知道我的工作方式
You know how I work.

357
00:35:35,750 --> 00:35:38,560
至少要几周掌握资料  行动更要几个月的时间
I need time to familiarize myself with the details.

358
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:41,830
达绵  现在谈的是200万人的生命
2 million people live there.

359
00:35:41,980 --> 00:35:43,620
还有那里一半的其他生物 他们在等着我们行动
It's true half are criminals, but the other half need our help.

360
00:35:43,630 --> 00:35:46,930
这是非常时期  我们必须拯救这些无辜的人
Change your methods, or have those people on your conscience.

361
00:35:46,940 --> 00:35:49,940
为什么要我接?  这个任务根本不可能成功
How do you begin a mission that is doomed to failure?

362
00:35:49,950 --> 00:35:53,190
你让我去一个罪犯横行的区去拆除这个炸弹
How do I diffuse a bomb in an area I've never been to?

363
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:54,410
这区我从没去过  也不想去
There's no way.

364
00:35:54,510 --> 00:35:56,720
对于地区的问题  我们给你找到一个人
Don't worry, you will have a guide.

365
00:35:56,820 --> 00:35:58,560
瞧  还要和别人一起干
Great, I'm gonna have a helper?

366
00:35:58,570 --> 00:36:02,260
一个在那出生的年轻人  他对那了如指掌
This guide was born in the area. He knows it like the back of his hand.

367
00:36:02,270 --> 00:36:03,430
这能帮你省不少事吧?
Will he help?

368
00:36:03,590 --> 00:36:05,500
他是自愿的还被逼的
You've asked him, he's been briefed?

369
00:36:05,600 --> 00:36:09,170
现在还不知道  不过你会让他知道的
He's clueless. You have to recruit him.

370
00:36:25,100 --> 00:36:28,220
-雷托  转监  -去哪?
-Leito, you're being moved.  -Where to?

371
00:36:28,230 --> 00:36:30,320
闭嘴
You'll see.

372
00:36:49,710 --> 00:36:52,670
112号  已上车
112- in the van.

373
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:59,550
放开我  放开我!
Let me go! Let go!

374
00:37:02,230 --> 00:37:04,730
起来!
Fucking let go!

375
00:37:13,490 --> 00:37:17,160
263号  已上车
263- in the van.

376
00:37:18,070 --> 00:37:21,660
靠  他咬了我
You cock sucking, wet tampon!

377
00:37:35,380 --> 00:37:37,880
-你还好吧  -不能再好了
-How're you?  -Super.

378
00:37:37,890 --> 00:37:41,420
这些笨蛋以为能把我关住
That fucker thought he could treat me like that.

379
00:37:41,430 --> 00:37:44,020
我要出去了
I'm off.

380
00:37:44,350 --> 00:37:47,050
你觉的用那玩意你能打开那锁吗?
The doors don't open that easy.

381
00:37:47,060 --> 00:37:49,010
你还不知道我的本事
My friend, you obviously don't know me

382
00:37:49,020 --> 00:37:50,810
我外号"魅影"  ("Phantom Of Opera"  歌剧魅影)
They call me Phantom.

383
00:37:50,820 --> 00:37:53,310
"魅影"可没有耐心在监狱里呆8个月
Phantom ain't doing an 8 year stretch.

384
00:37:53,320 --> 00:37:56,820
-你怎么进来的?  -我搞死了5个
-What you in for?  -I killed 5 guys.

385
00:37:56,830 --> 00:37:59,640
他们都该死  现在我就想从这出去
But the main guy got away from me.

386
00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:02,280
那你干了什么?
What did he do to you?

387
00:38:03,950 --> 00:38:08,110
他们杀了我父亲和兄弟  我受不了那家伙还逍遥法外
He killed my dad and brothers. I won't give up until he's dead.

388
00:38:08,120 --> 00:38:12,490
我要去13区宰了那混蛋
I'm gonna hit borough 13 and wipe that motherfucker out.

389
00:38:12,500 --> 00:38:16,590
-他住13区?  -也要死在那
-That's where he lives?  -Yeah, and that's where he'll die.

390
00:38:18,130 --> 00:38:21,720
-叫什么名字?  -塔哈  你认识?
-What's his name?  -Taha. You heard of him?

391
00:38:22,310 --> 00:38:26,880
我曾经想和他做朋友  但现在我后悔了
I wanted to be friends a long time ago but I regret it now.

392
00:38:26,890 --> 00:38:30,220
他手下还有一大群亡命徒
He lives in a bunker, a whole army around him.

393
00:38:30,230 --> 00:38:33,560
他还养了个怪东西
Motherfucker's got some weird bitch with him all the time.

394
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:38,560
-什么?  -他用绳子像牵狗一样牵着
-Who's that?  -Some drugged up girl that he keeps on a leash. Like a dog.

395
00:38:38,570 --> 00:38:43,870
这东西扑着咬人很厉害  叫劳拉
The girl is always fucked up on some shit. I think she's called Lola.

396
00:38:48,790 --> 00:38:51,580
我两分钟搞定他们
The Phantom will be back in 2 minutes.

397
00:39:05,260 --> 00:39:07,560
嘿  前边还有个位子
Come up front.

398
00:39:12,360 --> 00:39:16,030
-我把你放哪?  -就在13区
-Where you wanna be dropped?  -Borough 13 will be fine.

399
00:39:16,040 --> 00:39:19,280
顺路  我是达绵
Wicked. Damien.

400
00:39:21,320 --> 00:39:23,200
雷托
Leito.

401
00:39:30,920 --> 00:39:33,920
很好  他们出了监狱  一切按计划进行
Thanks. They are out. Plan is on course.

402
00:39:33,930 --> 00:39:38,450
-他们在一起吗?  -他们都在车里
-Are they still together?  -Without a doubt. In the truck, we are tailing.

403
00:39:38,460 --> 00:39:40,580
干的漂亮  上校
Excellent. Congratulations, Chief.

404
00:39:40,590 --> 00:39:44,880
还没到祝贺的时候  去那里可比越狱难多了
Still too early. Escaping from jail is easier than getting into borough 13.

405
00:39:44,890 --> 00:39:47,590
在13区  还要看那个向导雷托了
And we don't know what kind of guide this Leito will turn out to be.

406
00:39:47,600 --> 00:39:49,470
单凭达绵是完不成这次任务的
Without him, Damien won't achieve much.

407
00:39:49,480 --> 00:39:52,640
我们对你的人完全有信心
Your Captain is our last hope.

408
00:40:06,160 --> 00:40:08,670
你给我看着点  我不太熟悉这里的路
So are you gonna help me out? What's the best route to take?

409
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:10,280
你有方法能让我们能偷偷进去吗?
Can we get in undetected?

410
00:40:10,290 --> 00:40:12,570
直走就好了
Yep, throw a right here.

411
00:40:12,580 --> 00:40:16,330
-你开玩笑  这是干什么?  -你就丢不了
-What are you doing?  -Why? Don't you trust me?

412
00:40:16,340 --> 00:40:20,290
-快点放开我  -你想进去?
-Get these fucking cuffs off!  -You really want to get into borough 13?

413
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:24,180
-当然  -现在我是"魅影"  你听我的
-Yeah. I'm the Phantom now, so do exactly what I say.

414
00:40:24,190 --> 00:40:26,010
向右转
Turn right.

415
00:40:27,600 --> 00:40:30,770
-现在呢?  -向右转
-And now?  -Right.

416
00:40:52,410 --> 00:40:54,710
右转
Turn right.

417
00:40:56,170 --> 00:40:57,830
向右  我说
I said, fucking right!

418
00:40:57,840 --> 00:41:00,330
我不聋  妈的这车有问题
I'm not fucking deaf, the steering is fucked!

419
00:41:00,340 --> 00:41:02,830
好  现在停下
So brake.

420
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:05,340
没刹车了!
The brakes are fucked as well.

421
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:12,470
靠上那边的车  我们就停下了
Ok, into that car, gently.

422
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,350
我叫你慢慢的
That was supposed to be gentle?

423
00:41:19,450 --> 00:41:20,960
我已经尽力了
Look man it was the best I could do.

424
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:23,480
不行你就另找个司机
If you don't like the skills, run and jump, punk.

425
00:41:23,490 --> 00:41:25,000
现在放开我!
Let me loose.

426
00:41:25,100 --> 00:41:27,000
你在这不是挺好  这是13区了
You can handle it, boy you got it made.

427
00:41:27,010 --> 00:41:28,060
你说什么?
What you saying?

428
00:41:28,070 --> 00:41:31,190
你是警察  自做聪明的家伙
You're a cop. You can't fool me.

429
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:33,230
先松开我!
So you're gonna leave me here?

430
00:41:33,330 --> 00:41:35,140
你不是想让我带你来这吗?  现在你到了
You needed borough 13 and you're in, so bye-bye?

431
00:41:35,240 --> 00:41:38,280
你可以看看你的警官手册  找找办法
Consult your manual, chapter heading "Fucked Situation".

432
00:41:38,290 --> 00:41:40,450
雷托你疯了  我怎么会是警察
Leito, are you mad. I ain't a cop.

433
00:41:40,460 --> 00:41:43,500
快点放了我  我帮你逃出来的记得吗?
Get me out of here, fuck I helped you escape, remember?

434
00:41:43,510 --> 00:41:47,160
我不管这个  在我看来警察都有毛病
I know why you helped me. So I can help you with something right?

435
00:41:47,170 --> 00:41:49,110
我他妈懒得管
Not interested in your stupid agenda. Fuck off.

436
00:41:49,120 --> 00:41:51,640
你不想救你妹妹了?
Hey, what about your sister?

437
00:41:52,060 --> 00:41:55,520
我妹妹  我去救
I don't need your help to free her.

438
00:41:59,980 --> 00:42:01,860
靠!
Shit!

439
00:42:20,420 --> 00:42:24,160
是你撞的我的车?
Motherfucking bomba ras, check me car, rudeboy!

440
00:42:24,170 --> 00:42:27,110
很抱歉  我刚从号子里逃出来
Sorry, but I just got out of jail and the brakes packed up.

441
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:29,110
我想找个地方停车  这车没刹车了
I need a hideout.

442
00:42:29,120 --> 00:42:30,930
找个地方?
Hideout?

443
00:42:31,260 --> 00:42:35,010
你找错地方了  这可不是摩纳哥
Boy is you proper fucked up. Where d'you think this is, Monaco?

444
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:37,310
这是巴格达
This here is Baghdad.

445
00:43:17,350 --> 00:43:21,510
-让他们退后  -别胡来
-Out of the way.  -Relax. Easy.

446
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:25,610
不好意思  我的那辆赔给你  这样大家都好过
I'm sorry about your car. Take the truck, deal stands?

447
00:43:46,550 --> 00:43:48,500
那炸弹你卖了吗?
Did you dispose of the bomb?

448
00:43:48,510 --> 00:43:51,780
-还没来得及  我们有麻烦了  是雷托   -雷托?
-No, well until. Leito...  -What? Leito?

449
00:43:51,790 --> 00:43:54,470
他一小时前逃出来了
He escaped from prison.

450
00:43:55,300 --> 00:43:58,470
那他很快就会找上门来
So he'll be here soon.

451
00:44:02,190 --> 00:44:07,610
嘿  醒醒  你哥哥要来接你了
Wake up! Some news about your brother. He's coming for a visit.

452
00:44:09,900 --> 00:44:13,700
-叫大家小心点  -好的
-Be ready.  -Ok.

453
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:33,540
你怎么知道我是警察?
How did you find out I was a cop?

454
00:44:33,550 --> 00:44:37,300
这没人有你这么专业的身手  受过训吧?
Your fighting style is too technical. Training I guess?

455
00:44:37,310 --> 00:44:39,710
你要是混的  我能看出来
But to fit in, you're lacking something.

456
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:41,640
-看出来什么?  -仇恨
-What?  -Real anger.

457
00:44:41,650 --> 00:44:43,910
哦  很抱歉我还没学会
I guess my training didn't cover that.

458
00:44:43,920 --> 00:44:46,530
我学的是自由  平等  博爱
Freedom, Fairness, Family, that's what they taught me.

459
00:44:46,540 --> 00:44:49,520
-你的意思是水  煤气和电  -少开玩笑
-Water, gas, electric...  -You can laugh all you want.

460
00:44:49,530 --> 00:44:52,140
-你不在乎法律吗  -我只希望人人平等
-You're lawless.  -I want fairness and justice for everyone.

461
00:44:52,150 --> 00:44:55,160
想想那些混蛋  我就是为这才来这里的
Everyone, and I'm here to make sure everyone gets justice.

462
00:44:55,170 --> 00:44:56,880
你只是个听任摆布的看门狗!
I'm not a butler, I don't take orders.

463
00:44:56,890 --> 00:44:59,940
我就是要对付那些违法的家伙
I bite, when I see things being done against the law.

464
00:44:59,950 --> 00:45:03,520
我出生的时候这里就已经是这样子了
I was born in this manor. It's always hard to breathe here.

465
00:45:03,530 --> 00:45:07,870
10年前他们建起了高墙  我们做错什么了?
10 years ago they built a wall around this place. What did I do?

466
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:10,580
我一直遵守这该死的法律
I didn't break any laws, not one.

467
00:45:10,590 --> 00:45:12,870
我四年级就辍学  不是因为卖大麻
I quit school, not for a job selling crack,

468
00:45:12,880 --> 00:45:14,750
而是他们关了学校
but because they closed the school down.

469
00:45:14,760 --> 00:45:16,610
我出生在这真他妈倒霉
I was unlucky to be born here.

470
00:45:16,620 --> 00:45:19,930
那像你那样为所欲为就能解决问题?
So you think burning cars is gonna make things better?

471
00:45:19,940 --> 00:45:22,050
那你有办法解决吗?
You got a better idea?

472
00:45:22,060 --> 00:45:24,770
现在还没
Well at the moment, no.

473
00:45:25,400 --> 00:45:28,340
你知道我来干什么?  还放了你?
Do you know why I'm here? Why I let you go?

474
00:45:28,350 --> 00:45:31,870
-我想一定有个好理由  -当然有个好理由.
-A good deed?  -To save this neighbourhood

475
00:45:31,880 --> 00:45:34,540
这鬼地方有个中子弹  两个小时内我不把它拆除
There's an active neutron bomb here. If I don't disable it,

476
00:45:34,550 --> 00:45:38,100
13区就会被炸上天
there wont be anything left of this place. Borough 13 no longer, get me?

477
00:45:38,110 --> 00:45:40,190
这个理由不错吧
Everybody dies. If I think like you,

478
00:45:40,200 --> 00:45:43,320
你们这200万人的死活跟我有什么关系?
what good are these 2 million people? No use to me.

479
00:45:43,330 --> 00:45:45,290
但总得有个傻蛋
But there will always be people like you,

480
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:48,120
到你这鸟地方来维护正义
who thought the law was on their side, get me?

481
00:45:48,130 --> 00:45:50,410
好了  现在你是帮我找到那东西
So you gonna help me with this bomb.

482
00:45:50,510 --> 00:45:53,210
还是继续在这跟我唧唧歪歪?
Or are you too busy with your own shit?

483
00:45:54,420 --> 00:45:56,920
真有炸弹?
Is this bomb for real?

484
00:45:56,930 --> 00:46:01,090
-我不知道怎么回事  但确实有  -肯定在塔哈手上
-I can't say how it got here.  -But I'm sure Taha has got it.

485
00:46:01,100 --> 00:46:05,680
他有那炸弹还有你妹妹  我们可以合作吗
Yep. Your sister and my bomb, We gotta link up.

486
00:46:05,690 --> 00:46:09,350
你要敢再骗我一次  我会让你死得很惨
If you're bullshitting, I will fuck you up, believe me.

487
00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:12,150
说定了
That's cool.

488
00:46:14,030 --> 00:46:17,770
-你的计划是什么?  -你好好说说怎么进到塔哈那里
-You got a plan?  -I've got to get to Taha un-noticed.

489
00:46:17,780 --> 00:46:21,150
我去拆了炸弹  然后去救你妹妹
As soon as I take care of the bomb, I'll free your sister.

490
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:22,990
那我干什么?
And I'm supposed to sit around and wait?

491
00:46:23,000 --> 00:46:25,070
我们分头行动  你吸引他们注意力
No, you're the distraction.

492
00:46:25,080 --> 00:46:28,160
这时候我就可以工作了
Taha will be busy with you and I'll sort everything out.

493
00:46:28,170 --> 00:46:30,790
你觉得呢?
You like that shit don't you?

494
00:46:31,340 --> 00:46:33,490
-有电话吗?  -有
-You got a phone?  -Yeah.

495
00:46:33,500 --> 00:46:35,510
给我
Give it to me.

496
00:46:37,800 --> 00:46:40,840
你装备不错呀  都快赶上007了
Damn, Phantom, you're going on like James Bond.

497
00:46:50,100 --> 00:46:53,010
-喂?  -我是雷托
-Yes.  -It's Leito.

498
00:46:53,020 --> 00:46:56,280
-你怎么知道我的电话?  -我在号子里买的
-Where did you get my number from?  -You can buy anything on the inside.

499
00:46:56,290 --> 00:47:00,100
-听说你出来了  -我就在你对面的工厂里
-I heard you're on the outside.  -I'm across from you, the factory.

500
00:47:00,110 --> 00:47:02,620
你给谁打电话?
Who you calling?

501
00:47:05,330 --> 00:47:06,780
你想怎样?
So why ring me?

502
00:47:06,790 --> 00:47:09,700
我和个警察在一起  想和你做笔交易
I've got a cop with me. We've got a proposal for you.

503
00:47:09,710 --> 00:47:12,210
K2会去找你们
K2 will come and get you.

504
00:47:14,710 --> 00:47:16,100
你搞什么飞机?
Are you fucking nuts?

505
00:47:16,110 --> 00:47:19,920
我的计划是秘密的  秘密行动懂吗?
According to the plan, I was supposed to go in un-noticed.

506
00:47:19,930 --> 00:47:24,090
意思是我们悄悄潜入
Stealth like, side entrance, not the main fucking door.

507
00:47:24,100 --> 00:47:27,270
忘了你的警察守则吧  这可是13区
Forget your police manual. This is borough 13.

508
00:47:27,280 --> 00:47:29,720
和别处不一样  我对这了如指掌
Your laws don't apply, get me?

509
00:47:29,730 --> 00:47:32,530
-只有这样才行  -你的计划呢?
-And this is the only way.  -Your plan?

510
00:47:32,540 --> 00:47:34,970
我们对付他那些手下  然后找出冠军?
He who lives, wins.

511
00:47:34,980 --> 00:47:38,700
不会死人  这样我们节省时间能直接和塔哈接触
Nobody dies. We have one card to play.

512
00:47:38,710 --> 00:47:41,660
-凭什么?  -好奇心
-Which is?  -Curiosity.

513
00:47:42,030 --> 00:47:44,940
这小子说的什么警察?
Who's this cop?

514
00:47:44,950 --> 00:47:48,330
每次我问你们问题  你们就像群呆子
You got the same answers to every question, huh?

515
00:47:48,340 --> 00:47:49,950
都是些笨蛋
Like fucking cows.

516
00:47:49,960 --> 00:47:54,530
给我查一下  你去把那警察带来
I need info, on this cop. Before he dies.

517
00:47:54,540 --> 00:47:57,050
我5分钟后回来
You have 5 minutes.

518
00:47:58,300 --> 00:48:02,140
-这样太冒险了  -你一个人死定了
-I don't like it, too risky.  -Without me you'll die.

519
00:48:02,150 --> 00:48:05,590
我一直是一个人干的  活着到现在了
I always work alone and I'm still alive. Later.

520
00:48:05,600 --> 00:48:09,000
我知道这里所有的路  我还挖了一条秘道
I know all the ins and outs here. I dug one tunnel myself.

521
00:48:09,010 --> 00:48:11,470
那最好  我想你自己能从这出去
So you made good use of your hands.

522
00:48:11,480 --> 00:48:15,810
我知道那炸弹在哪!  没有我你找不到的
I know where the bomb is. Without me you'll never find it.

523
00:48:15,820 --> 00:48:18,520
5分钟前你还不知道有炸弹的事
5 minutes ago you didn't even know about the bomb.

524
00:48:18,530 --> 00:48:19,830
你想骗我?
You're fucking with me?

525
00:48:19,960 --> 00:48:21,170
塔哈有个保险库
Taha built a huge bunker a while ago.

526
00:48:21,270 --> 00:48:22,480
我知道怎么进去
And I know where it is.

527
00:48:22,490 --> 00:48:23,830
你怎么知道在里面?
How do you know the bomb will be there?

528
00:48:23,990 --> 00:48:26,490
你难道会放在厨房里吗?
He don't keep shit like that in his kitchen.

529
00:48:27,080 --> 00:48:29,500
就这样  我放开你  你乖乖听我的
Here's the deal. I free you and you do what I say.

530
00:48:29,510 --> 00:48:30,860
还是听我的吧
How about another way.

531
00:48:30,960 --> 00:48:35,060
少废话  你最好祈祷我妹妹还活着
You shut the fuck up and pray my sister is alive.

532
00:48:35,160 --> 00:48:36,760
我会帮你找到那炸弹
Then I'll find the bomb.

533
00:48:36,870 --> 00:48:39,250
好了  现在松开我
Take these off, or we both end up in jail.

534
00:48:41,670 --> 00:48:43,550
只有这样了
All right.

535
00:48:47,930 --> 00:48:51,290
-他是那警察?  -你猜的太准了  K2
-This is the cop?  -Damn you're observant. I'm impressed.

536
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:54,590
闭嘴  一会再收拾你
Shut up. If Taha lets you off I'll deal with you myself!

537
00:48:54,600 --> 00:48:59,020
走吧  别干傻事  我们可不留情
Lets move, and don't try any weird shit. The boys are a bit nervous.

538
00:49:14,000 --> 00:49:17,500
-我给钱你来睡觉!  -我只是养会神
-Did you come here to sleep?  -Sorry, just tired.

539
00:49:17,510 --> 00:49:20,460
-他在那?  -最里面
-Where is he?  -His place.

540
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:31,010
-他吃了吗?  -他吃个不停
-Has he eaten?  -He eats all the time.

541
00:49:35,270 --> 00:49:39,480
你有活干了  可以活动活动
You've got a job. Warm up.

542
00:49:45,490 --> 00:49:49,910
他们这东西可真不少
With this arsenal, you could take over Paris.

543
00:49:54,250 --> 00:49:59,130
-那个运炸弹的车  -至少知道在这
-That's the bomb transporter.  -So it's still here.

544
00:50:05,930 --> 00:50:07,790
你等在这  完事我过来接你
Wait here. I'll be quick.

545
00:50:07,800 --> 00:50:09,890
少来
No thanks.

546
00:50:25,530 --> 00:50:28,020
你有个警察搭档了
So you're friendly with the cops now?

547
00:50:28,030 --> 00:50:31,770
不是我搭档  只有他能拆了那炸弹
He ain't my friend, but only he knows how to de-activate the bomb.

548
00:50:31,780 --> 00:50:35,240
-听起来不错  -要不然八公里内什么也留不下
-Really?  -It will destroy everything within 8km.

549
00:50:35,250 --> 00:50:36,860
你是来救我们的?
So you came to rescue us?

550
00:50:36,870 --> 00:50:40,120
我有密码拆掉那东西  这的人都没事
I can stop the clock and save 2 million people.

551
00:50:40,130 --> 00:50:45,960
国家派个英雄来拯救我们  没有他我们都完蛋
The Government sends a cop to save us from a bomb.

552
00:50:45,970 --> 00:50:48,040
真他妈的崇高
That's so noble.

553
00:50:48,050 --> 00:50:51,590
我相信你  谁也不想留着那东西
To be honest, we weren't planning to keep it here.

554
00:50:51,600 --> 00:50:54,300
-你想拿走?  -是的
-Do you wanna take it?  -Yes.

555
00:50:54,310 --> 00:50:56,390
愿意出多少?
How much for?

556
00:50:58,270 --> 00:51:01,430
塔哈  我不输密码一小时后就爆炸
If I don't enter the correct code within the hour, this whole place blows.

557
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:04,610
我知道  不过这关我什么事?!  你出点钱不就好了
I know. Although by that time I'll have already sold it.

558
00:51:04,620 --> 00:51:06,370
但是这关你的事
If you don't want to wait too long for the explosion.

559
00:51:06,470 --> 00:51:08,470
你不想它爆炸吧
I suggest you start negotiations.

560
00:51:08,480 --> 00:51:10,210
会有200万人死掉
Innocent people will die.

561
00:51:10,310 --> 00:51:11,810
这事要早考虑呀
You should of thought of that earlier.

562
00:51:11,820 --> 00:51:13,880
比如造它之前
For example, when you were making it.

563
00:51:13,890 --> 00:51:19,320
你出多少?
How much for?

564
00:51:19,330 --> 00:51:21,820
100万欧元
Million euros.

565
00:51:21,830 --> 00:51:24,330
右边那位先生出100万  真便宜
Million on my right. Not much.

566
00:51:24,430 --> 00:51:27,330
其他人有兴趣吗?  K2
Anybody else eager, K2?

567
00:51:28,090 --> 00:51:31,090
200万  左边这位出价200万
2 million!  Brave K2 is saying 2 million.

568
00:51:31,100 --> 00:51:33,090
还有出价吗?
Anymore?

569
00:51:33,100 --> 00:51:36,780
-400万  -400万!  开始有点意思了
-4 million. - 4 million on my right.

570
00:51:36,790 --> 00:51:39,560
你不会一直跟下去吧?
How long are you gonna barter?

571
00:51:39,660 --> 00:51:43,560
你要是觉得那些人命不值这个数  我就停下来
Until our lives are worthless.

572
00:51:45,610 --> 00:51:50,600
1000万  右边的1000万  有点钱赚了
10! 10 million on my left It's getting interesting!

573
00:51:50,610 --> 00:51:57,200
怎么样还跟吗?  1000万了  你们继续  还是算了?
So bro, 10 million. Any more offers?

574
00:51:57,700 --> 00:52:01,000
那我就拍板了
Oh well, I think the reserve has been met.

575
00:52:01,100 --> 00:52:03,000
1000万一次
10 million going once!

576
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:06,460
两次
10 million twice!

577
00:52:09,590 --> 00:52:12,290
2000万!
20 million!

578
00:52:12,300 --> 00:52:15,210
这才是做大买卖的
That's a big jump up.

579
00:52:15,220 --> 00:52:19,170
-你呢K2?  -我不跟了
-K2?  -Let him have it, I pass.

580
00:52:19,180 --> 00:52:22,510
2000万  定了
20 million?  Sold!

581
00:52:22,520 --> 00:52:23,290
这买卖不错
Good buy.

582
00:52:23,300 --> 00:52:26,680
救了200万人  一个人才花10欧
For saving 2 million people, it works out 10 euro a head...

583
00:52:26,690 --> 00:52:29,650
多划算  这钱吃饭都不够
...cheaper than a "Happy Meal".

584
00:52:29,820 --> 00:52:32,730
-怎么给钱?  -转账
-Payment method?  -Transfer.

585
00:52:32,740 --> 00:52:36,740
还没把现金运来大家已经完了
Before you get confirmation of payment the bomb will explode.

586
00:52:37,540 --> 00:52:41,960
达迈尔  我们巴哈马司的帐号
Jamel, the account number in the Bahamas.

587
00:52:46,710 --> 00:52:50,660
-我要先看看炸弹  -有趣  我就知道你要问这个
-I need to see the bomb.  -Funny, I thought you might.

588
00:52:50,670 --> 00:52:52,970
就在那边
Only quick.

589
00:52:58,180 --> 00:53:01,270
那东西没有助推器
It didn't come with its own rocket.

590
00:53:01,370 --> 00:53:04,270
幸好我们有枚俄制火箭
Luckily I had a few stored already. A revamped ex-soviet missile.

591
00:53:04,280 --> 00:53:09,730
现在它可以飞了  不过目的地  就让你们猜一下了
Ready to blast off. Destination? Well you can figure it out.

592
00:53:25,500 --> 00:53:31,210
现在行了  现在给钱吧
So then, cop, you've seen your bomb. You can start the money transfer.

593
00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:42,680
雷托  这次你觉得呢  这次我抢在你前边了
Leito, I've learnt from my mistakes. Now I'm one step ahead.

594
00:53:51,360 --> 00:53:54,740
找库戈先生
Put me in touch with Krüger; urgent.

595
00:54:39,740 --> 00:54:42,860
8  47  35
8  47  35

596
00:54:42,870 --> 00:54:45,780
ZULU ZULU FOX 代尔塔 查里
Sulu, Sulu, Fox, Delta, Charlie.

597
00:54:45,790 --> 00:54:48,910
-转多少?  -2000万
-Amount?  -20 million euro.

598
00:54:48,920 --> 00:54:51,880
那炸弹肯定在那?
Are you certain of the bomb's location?

599
00:54:52,880 --> 00:54:56,830
就在我前面  只有48分钟了
It's in front of me. 48 minutes left on the clock.

600
00:54:56,840 --> 00:54:59,220
上尉  我没权转这么大的数
Not enough in the budget.

601
00:54:59,230 --> 00:55:02,720
你另想办法吧  抱歉
Please find other means. I'm sorry.

602
00:55:10,810 --> 00:55:14,610
我等着  正在转
Fine, I'll wait. The transfer will be ready soon.

603
00:55:14,780 --> 00:55:17,690
谢谢  上校
Thanks, Sarge.

604
00:55:17,700 --> 00:55:22,270
2000万已经转好了  现在我该处理炸弹了
That's it, 20 million transferred to your account. My turn with the code.

605
00:55:22,280 --> 00:55:26,500
还没结束呢  达迈尔问一下那边  钱到了没有
The transaction isn't done yet. Jamel, phone the Bahamas and check.

606
00:55:26,510 --> 00:55:28,330
我正在问
One minute.

607
00:55:35,000 --> 00:55:36,810
银行半小时后开门
The bank opens in 30 minutes.

608
00:55:36,820 --> 00:55:41,970
我们盼着早点开门吧  你们俩先在那边坐一会
Goddamn, let's hope it does. In this event you will have to wait.

609
00:55:42,510 --> 00:55:47,810
就这  跪地上  对着墙把手放头上
Get comfortable. On your knees. Faces to the wall, hands on heads.

610
00:55:49,810 --> 00:55:53,810
幽幽  看着他们
Yoyo, keep them there until further orders.

611
00:55:58,360 --> 00:56:01,080
-现在怎么办?  -都是那个计划搞的
-So now what?  -You wanted to come here.

612
00:56:01,090 --> 00:56:03,770
要是听我的  我们就不会在这
If not for you, we wouldn't be here.

613
00:56:03,780 --> 00:56:07,260
要是你朋友给了钱  我们已经在外面了
And if your Generals had transferred the money, we would be free.

614
00:56:07,270 --> 00:56:10,860
错  我们早死了  你想着塔哈会让我们这样走吗?
No, we would be dead. You think, Taha would let us live?

615
00:56:10,870 --> 00:56:14,460
没给钱之前  我们怎么会知道
Fuck no, but they still didn't pay.

616
00:56:14,630 --> 00:56:17,880
对他们来说你的命值多少?
How valuable are you to them?

617
00:56:18,380 --> 00:56:21,630
现在不是说这的时候
Shit, they couldn't care less.

618
00:56:26,100 --> 00:56:29,730
达绵  我觉得这里面有些奇怪
Damien, something doesn't quite add up here.

619
00:56:29,820 --> 00:56:32,760
-怎么?  -就是有些怪
-Why is that?  -It doesn't make sense.

620
00:56:33,770 --> 00:56:35,330
被偷了个炸弹  他们好象无所谓
They lost the bomb, like it was a car key.

621
00:56:35,430 --> 00:56:36,840
想找回去又不肯给钱
They want it back, but not at the price.

622
00:56:36,940 --> 00:56:39,230
这么大数额  他们也要考虑一下
When it comes to money, they stop thinking.

623
00:56:39,240 --> 00:56:45,060
-你现在还替他们说话  -我没替他们说话  就事论事而已
-And you're defending them?  -Not them, the law.

624
00:56:45,070 --> 00:56:48,450
你也一样
Plus human life, just like you.

625
00:57:04,680 --> 00:57:06,970
还有多长时间
How long?

626
00:57:10,930 --> 00:57:13,220
37分钟
37 minutes.

627
00:57:13,230 --> 00:57:16,800
-要想点办法了  -是呀  想啊
-We have to do something!  -You think?

628
00:57:16,810 --> 00:57:21,230
-我有主意了  -说吧
-I've an idea.  -What?

629
00:57:21,820 --> 00:57:25,110
-记得我说过的地道吗?  -你挖的那个?
-Remember the tunnel?  -The one I dug?

630
00:57:25,120 --> 00:57:30,160
对  入口就在电梯左边的厕所里
The same one. The entrance is in the toilet left from the lift.

631
00:57:31,830 --> 00:57:34,640
你觉得幽幽会让我们去吗?
You think he'll let us go to the John together?

632
00:57:34,650 --> 00:57:37,240
我们要找个理由去找塔哈
No, we make an excuse to talk with Taha.

633
00:57:37,250 --> 00:57:39,960
我们路过厕所
And we walk past the toilet.

634
00:57:40,170 --> 00:57:43,710
到了电梯呢?
Sweet. So when we get to the lift, what?

635
00:57:43,720 --> 00:57:46,220
-见机行事  -这样不行
-Improvise.  -That's half a plan!

636
00:57:46,230 --> 00:57:48,710
-你有更好的办法吗?  -没有
-You got a better one?  -No.

637
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:50,810
干吧
Then let's go.

638
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:55,730
-趴下  -我有急事找塔哈
-Who let you get up?  -We need to see Taha, it's urgent.

639
00:57:55,740 --> 00:58:00,390
听起来真不错  不过你给我乖乖趴下  闭上你的臭嘴
All right. I see, sit your ass down, before I put you down, fool!

640
00:58:00,400 --> 00:58:03,270
你真他妈太傻了  你叫什么来着?
You've got no sense have you?  What's your name?

641
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:04,380
关你什么事?
What's it to you?

642
00:58:04,390 --> 00:58:08,040
要是塔哈知道谁让他没了2000万  他会很高兴的
I'll need to tell Taha when he asks me, who lost him 20 million.

643
00:58:08,050 --> 00:58:10,200
听到你的名字  他会怎样
Your name.

644
00:58:11,040 --> 00:58:13,830
你要是敢耍我  我就宰了你
If you're pulling my dick, I'll have you!

645
00:58:13,840 --> 00:58:14,990
随便你
Ok.

646
00:58:15,000 --> 00:58:19,000
我们四个一起带他们过去  我还是不信你
You three, with me. The rest, cover.

647
00:58:19,380 --> 00:58:24,050
-放松点  看我的  -准备行动
-When to improvise?  -It will come naturally.

648
00:58:33,770 --> 00:58:35,630
-机会来了  -什么?
-Backflip on the run.  -How?

649
00:58:35,640 --> 00:58:37,520
行动
Move.

650
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:06,340
-就是这下面  -你想我们从马桶口下去吗!
-This is our way out.  -We're gonna go through the toilet?

651
00:59:17,140 --> 00:59:20,520
-你要当警察也是把好手  -这边走
-I'm a bad-ass cop.  -Run.

652
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:27,140
怎么了?  为什么不回话?
What's up, what's happened? Why didn't you reply?

653
00:59:27,150 --> 00:59:30,850
-我们在地道里  -什么地道  你耍我?
-We were in a tunnel.  -What tunnel? You playing some kind of game?

654
00:59:30,860 --> 00:59:32,640
都是因为那两个小子
It's cos of those two idiots.

655
00:59:32,650 --> 00:59:37,030
他俩从地道跑了  我们跟了一会就跟丢了
They escaped through a tunnel. We ran after them but got kinda lost.

656
00:59:37,040 --> 00:59:38,780
等下  说话慢一点
Hold on, repeat that slowly.

657
00:59:38,790 --> 00:59:41,120
雷托和那警察...
They escaped...

658
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:54,180
达迈尔  钱转过来了没有?
Jamel, the transaction?

659
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:01,610
-我们有麻烦了  塔哈  -他们没转?
-I've got bad news.  -He was bluffing?

660
01:00:01,620 --> 01:00:03,430
-没有  -我就知道
-Yes.  -I thought so.

661
01:00:03,440 --> 01:00:06,720
就不能信警察  有他们好瞧的  敢耍我
You can't trust a cop. Stupid of me to think I could.

662
01:00:06,730 --> 01:00:09,980
我现在就搞炸那东西
He'll pay. I'm gonna launch that bomb.

663
01:00:09,990 --> 01:00:14,280
塔哈  你先冷静点
Taha, that's not all. You better sit down.

664
01:00:16,540 --> 01:00:18,660
他们用那个账号...
They used our account number to...

665
01:00:18,760 --> 01:00:22,160
清空了我们账户里的钱  一分都没剩下
take money out of the account and other accounts.

666
01:00:22,170 --> 01:00:24,870
怎么可能?  哪些账户?
Which other accounts?

667
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:30,170
巴哈马司  海牙  卡拉其  所有的账户都空了
Bahamas, Riyadh, Karachi, even London. All zero balances.

668
01:00:32,180 --> 01:00:34,250
这怎么可能  他们怎么做到的?
How'd they manage that?

669
01:00:34,260 --> 01:00:38,270
我要知道早就发达了
I don't know. If I find out, I can rule the world.

670
01:00:38,850 --> 01:00:43,940
说实话我真不擅长这个  我辞职
To be honest, I'm a bad hacker, so I resign.

671
01:00:47,820 --> 01:00:49,900
让一下
Excuse me.

672
01:00:56,370 --> 01:01:02,500
塔哈  我们这周的工钱怎么给?
Taha, if you're broke, how you gonna pay us for this week?

673
01:01:13,470 --> 01:01:17,420
我还有的是钱  在地下室的保险柜  他们怎么也搞不走
There's money in the safe, downstairs. They haven't touched that.

674
01:01:17,430 --> 01:01:20,390
K2  把你的枪给我
K2, gimme your gun.

675
01:01:23,690 --> 01:01:26,650
K2  枪拿过来  靠
My gun, why?

676
01:01:38,490 --> 01:01:42,500
你们这一群可怜虫!
You're all a bunch of useless thugs!

677
01:02:06,650 --> 01:02:09,820
K2现在我们干什么?
So what now, K2?

678
01:02:15,820 --> 01:02:21,540
先找到雷托和那警察  去叫上所有人
We need to catch those two. I'm calling a safari.

679
01:03:22,350 --> 01:03:24,640
分头走
Split up.

680
01:04:57,230 --> 01:05:00,280
闪开
Out of the way!  Move!

681
01:05:01,610 --> 01:05:03,490
警察!
Police!

682
01:05:48,330 --> 01:05:50,820
那东西还剩多长时间?
When's the bomb gonna blow?

683
01:05:50,830 --> 01:05:53,700
-10分钟  -你知道怎么拆了它?
-In 10 minutes.  -Can you disable it?

684
01:05:53,710 --> 01:05:55,200
这只有我能
Yes. Nobody but me.

685
01:05:55,210 --> 01:05:58,700
你去拆了它  雷托跟我们在下面
Ok, you deal with the bomb and your friend stays with us.

686
01:05:58,710 --> 01:06:00,990
-我需要他和我一起  -这可不行
-I need his help.  -He stays.

687
01:06:01,000 --> 01:06:04,790
那我们都待这等死吧  你最好现在就走
Ok, me and Leito stay here, and you go diffuse the bomb.

688
01:06:04,800 --> 01:06:07,300
只有9分钟了
9 minutes left.

689
01:06:10,640 --> 01:06:15,220
好吧  我们在这等着  你们总得下来吧  
Ok, both of you go. You have to come down eventually.

690
01:06:15,230 --> 01:06:19,230
如果一切顺利  你会很高兴看见我的
If all goes well, you'll be glad to see me.

691
01:06:49,010 --> 01:06:53,430
-这是什么东西?  -塔哈的手下
-Who's this?  -Present from Taha.

692
01:06:53,600 --> 01:06:56,100
让我们去见识一下
Nice present.

693
01:07:46,150 --> 01:07:50,360
嘿大块头  给你来点有意思的
Hey, big guy, let me show you a new trick!

694
01:08:28,280 --> 01:08:30,150
快呀
Go!

695
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:47,380
-不错嘛  在哪学的?  -在一本钓鱼杂志上
-Were did you learn that?  -I read it in an anglers magazine.

696
01:09:13,570 --> 01:09:16,740
-没事了  劳拉!  -还没结束
-It's ok, Lola.  -It's over.

697
01:09:19,410 --> 01:09:21,130
妈的
No, it ain't over yet.

698
01:09:25,230 --> 01:09:27,130
没信号
No signal.

699
01:09:29,210 --> 01:09:31,290
行了
Finally.

700
01:09:31,300 --> 01:09:35,720
没事了  他会拆了那炸弹
Don't worry. He'll free us.

701
01:09:37,970 --> 01:09:39,820
-喂?  -托马索上尉?
-Hello.  -Captain Tomaso?

702
01:09:39,830 --> 01:09:41,450
我需要密码拆除炸弹
I'm at the bomb. I need the code.

703
01:09:41,460 --> 01:09:44,160
-你现在在哪?  -就在炸弹前面  只剩3分钟了
-Where are you?  -At the bloody bomb! 3 minutes left.

704
01:09:44,170 --> 01:09:46,300
先给我密码  别的以后再说
Give me the code, there's no time to chit chat!

705
01:09:46,310 --> 01:09:47,700
你确切的位置在那?
Your exact location?

706
01:09:47,710 --> 01:09:50,890
13区的一幢房子顶上  这样行了吗?
On top of a tall building, central borough 13. Enough?

707
01:09:50,900 --> 01:09:55,480
-干得好托马索  你又成功了!  -别��嗦了!
-Good work, we are proud of you.  -The code?

708
01:09:55,490 --> 01:09:58,610
-9293
-9293

709
01:09:58,620 --> 01:10:01,110
7  09  B13
7 09 B13

710
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:05,330
709B13  行了回头再说
709B13   I'll call back if I'm still alive.

711
01:10:12,590 --> 01:10:15,370
B13 代表13区?
B13, borough 13.

712
01:10:15,480 --> 01:10:17,810
难道你不觉得奇怪  这密码叫13区吗?
Strange that the bomb has that code.

713
01:10:17,910 --> 01:10:19,820
9293也是区号
And 9293 is our map co-ordinates.

714
01:10:19,820 --> 01:10:21,760
那又怎么了
Coincidence.

715
01:10:21,770 --> 01:10:23,890
达绵  好好想一下
Damien, wait. This bomb is not meant for here.

716
01:10:23,900 --> 01:10:27,230
这难道是偶然的吗?
Then why do the co-ordinates match?

717
01:10:27,360 --> 01:10:29,260
现在是要把它停下来  懂吗!
We need to disarm it anyway.

718
01:10:29,270 --> 01:10:31,950
-达绵  想想如果正相反  -什么意思?
-What if it's all back to front?  -Back to front?

719
01:10:31,960 --> 01:10:34,060
这密码正好是启动它的
Instead of disarming it, you're gonna arm it!

720
01:10:34,070 --> 01:10:35,870
你是白痴吗  要启动哪要费这么多事
Are you nuts? Then why send me?

721
01:10:35,970 --> 01:10:37,670
它可以自动爆炸的
It would have exploded itself.

722
01:10:37,680 --> 01:10:40,190
他们怎么知道是13区的中心点
They had to find out if it was in the right place.

723
01:10:40,200 --> 01:10:44,330
想想他们在电话里说的  "你是不是在13区中心?"
Isn't that what the Chief asked? If it's in the central area?

724
01:10:44,440 --> 01:10:45,830
那又怎样  只不过是为了安全
Yeah, but that's a standard question.

725
01:10:46,020 --> 01:10:47,210
这是个陷阱  达绵
It's a trap, I'm certain.

726
01:10:47,330 --> 01:10:48,820
你给我闪开
Fuck off, don't interfere!

727
01:10:54,920 --> 01:10:57,420
我已经救过你一次了  相信我
I saved your life once already.

728
01:10:57,520 --> 01:10:59,220
我必须完成我的任务
I'm under orders to do this.

729
01:11:16,400 --> 01:11:18,490
我没别的办法
I'm sorry.

730
01:11:44,350 --> 01:11:46,000
别再闹了  再过一分钟  大家都完了
Stop, Leito, in a minute we all blow up!

731
01:11:46,010 --> 01:11:47,860
睁开你的狗眼仔细看看这!
Open your fucking eyes, Damien!

732
01:11:47,860 --> 01:11:49,360
他们根本就不在乎我们的死活!
Are you blind to the fact that they don't care about this area!

733
01:11:49,370 --> 01:11:51,300
二十多年一直是这样
For 20 years they couldn't solve the problem.

734
01:11:51,310 --> 01:11:53,930
他们建了这墙  现在要大清洗了
They put up a huge wall, and now they want to clean the place up.

735
01:11:53,940 --> 01:11:57,000
你难道没发现这里没有公务员  没有学校  没有邮局
The local authority is gone. No post office, no schools.

736
01:11:57,010 --> 01:11:58,460
就连最后的警局也关了
Even the police have left.

737
01:11:58,470 --> 01:12:00,750
他们怎么安排这炸弹被偷
The bomb was stolen, they didn't build it here.

738
01:12:00,850 --> 01:12:02,750
几个小混混就把装甲押运车抢了?!
They blew open the truck?

739
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:03,610
没错!
Yes!

740
01:12:03,620 --> 01:12:05,330
-他们在编故事  -可能吗?
-They sold you a lie.  -Yeah?

741
01:12:05,340 --> 01:12:08,200
想想为什么咱们看到的车没有一点损伤
Then explain to me why the truck is in one piece?

742
01:12:08,210 --> 01:12:11,030
那些被炸的痕迹到哪去了?
Why there are no signs of a blast? The lack of doors?

743
01:12:11,040 --> 01:12:14,160
-也许不是同一辆车  -就是那辆  你知道的!
-Maybe it was a different truck. -You know it's the same one!

744
01:12:14,170 --> 01:12:17,040
这是因为他们想让这炸弹在这里爆炸
As soon as they were certain the bomb was in borough 13.

745
01:12:17,050 --> 01:12:20,350
还让你来引爆它  你的任务完成地不错
they called you, so you could activate it. You get me?

746
01:12:20,360 --> 01:12:22,830
你阻止了塔哈
You got rid of Taha for them and now everybody else.

747
01:12:23,020 --> 01:12:25,720
结果你他妈的要自己引爆它!
And you nearly went though with it!

748
01:12:45,450 --> 01:12:49,210
不可能  我不能拿200万人开玩笑
You can't kill 2 million people just because of a few social problems!

749
01:12:49,220 --> 01:12:53,420
他们杀了600万人  就因为他们不是蓝眼睛黄头发
How many will they kill because of the colour of their hair or eyes?

750
01:13:09,430 --> 01:13:11,730
原谅我  雷托
I'm sorry, Leito.

751
01:13:26,950 --> 01:13:28,990
-你不能这么做  -放开我  劳拉!
-Sorry.  -You can't, Lola.

752
01:13:29,000 --> 01:13:32,620
我宁愿相信我哥哥说的
I prefer to die believing my brother instead of you.

753
01:14:02,200 --> 01:14:07,490
-都结束了  -这次真的结束了
-That it?  -Yeah, this time around that's it.

754
01:14:10,750 --> 01:14:13,460
还有事没完
No, that's not it.

755
01:14:29,930 --> 01:14:33,260
嘿我说过你会很高兴再见到我的
I said you'd be glad to see me again.

756
01:14:33,270 --> 01:14:38,260
-我给你5分钟离开  -炸弹我拿走了
-You've got 5 minutes to leave.  -I'm taking this.

757
01:14:38,270 --> 01:14:40,570
随你便
It's yours.

758
01:14:52,660 --> 01:14:54,950
好极了  一直接不通
Right. Nothing.

759
01:14:54,960 --> 01:14:57,820
怎么搞的  已经过去一小时了
The bomb was supposed to go off an hour ago.

760
01:14:57,920 --> 01:14:59,620
如果今晚还没有消息  我们下一步怎样?
What do we do if it doesn't happen?

761
01:14:59,630 --> 01:15:02,660
我怎么知道  应该不会有问题的
Dunno. It was supposed to blow...then nothing happened.

762
01:15:02,670 --> 01:15:05,210
-外面怎么了?  -好象在打斗
-What's that noise?  -Sounds like fighting.

763
01:15:05,220 --> 01:15:07,050
还不快去看看!
Check it out!

764
01:15:19,770 --> 01:15:22,180
任务结束  当然  还差一点
The mission was almost a success. Almost.

765
01:15:22,190 --> 01:15:24,770
最后时刻  我把密码给忘了
At the last minute I couldn't remember the code.

766
01:15:24,780 --> 01:15:26,370
-对吧?  -没错
-Right?  -It happens.

767
01:15:26,380 --> 01:15:28,730
很抱歉  是我的错
It's my fault, I forget the numbers.

768
01:15:28,740 --> 01:15:30,900
-也许你记得吧?  -当然
-Maybe you remember?  -Yeah.

769
01:15:30,910 --> 01:15:34,360
他太厉害了  这个任务是我们一起完成的
This is a great guy. You've taught me so much.

770
01:15:34,370 --> 01:15:36,650
没有雷托  我早死了
Without him I'd have died.

771
01:15:36,660 --> 01:15:38,530
密码是多少?
So what are the numbers?

772
01:15:38,540 --> 01:15:42,080
-9293  -有点像区号?
-9293.  -Like the area?

773
01:15:42,090 --> 01:15:46,460
-有点  -真巧不是吗?
-Yes.  -Little coincidence.

774
01:15:46,470 --> 01:15:50,420
然后是709  就是今天
Next, 709. Easy to remember, today's date.

775
01:15:50,430 --> 01:15:54,590
709  9月7日  暑假结束  挺好记
709, 7th September. Day of delivery. Wicked, huh?

776
01:15:54,600 --> 01:16:00,430
这次可以一劳永逸了
Little bomb in the right place...and all your problems can go away.

777
01:16:00,440 --> 01:16:02,510
有什么你可以补充
Correct me if I'm wrong.

778
01:16:02,520 --> 01:16:06,680
继续输密码  我记起来了
Back to the code. I think it's coming to me.

779
01:16:06,690 --> 01:16:09,600
最后的密码是...B13
The last digits are...B13.

780
01:16:09,610 --> 01:16:13,980
不就是13区嘛  我怎么就忘了呢
Borough 13. How could I forget.

781
01:16:13,990 --> 01:16:15,160
您输完它吧
The rest you can do.

782
01:16:15,170 --> 01:16:18,060
你们疯了吗?  你们要在市中心引爆吗?
Are you crazy? Do you want to blow up the middle of Paris?

783
01:16:18,070 --> 01:16:20,660
我不明白  难道这密码不是拆除这炸弹的?
I don't get it. Isn't this the code to disarm the bomb?

784
01:16:20,670 --> 01:16:22,420
您的意思是这密码是引爆用的?
I hope it's not a code to arm it?

785
01:16:22,830 --> 01:16:24,830
别开玩笑了托马索上尉  你明白
Enough of these charades! You know full well!

786
01:16:25,000 --> 01:16:27,500
我不明白  请您解释一下
No I don't. Explain it to me.

787
01:16:27,510 --> 01:16:30,020
13区已经失去控制  一直在花钱
Borough 13 is uncontrollable. The upkeep is too expensive.

788
01:16:30,030 --> 01:16:32,720
我们的纳税人已经怨声载道  养这些无所事事的寄生虫!
People don't want to pay for the scum of society.

789
01:16:32,830 --> 01:16:34,370
那就用那个炸弹全清洗掉?
So you clean up with a bomb?

790
01:16:34,470 --> 01:16:37,270
没错  不太光彩但是很有效
Yeah! Undemocratic, but it solves a lot of problems.

791
01:16:37,280 --> 01:16:39,850
除了  你们
Bar one. Yours.

792
01:16:40,060 --> 01:16:42,940
-不要  别这样  -你不是要清洗吗?
-No, no don't do it.  -But you wanna clean up?

793
01:16:42,950 --> 01:16:44,700
我们都会死的
We'll all die.

794
01:16:44,800 --> 01:16:46,400
这你应该早想到!
You should of thought of that when you built it.

795
01:16:46,410 --> 01:16:48,190
别这样
No!

796
01:17:00,920 --> 01:17:05,080
清洗就能解决所有问题吗?
You believed me? That I'd blow everything up, including ourselves?

797
01:17:05,090 --> 01:17:07,580
还有其他的办法解决问题  是吗
No. There are other ways to solve problems of this nature.

798
01:17:07,590 --> 01:17:10,300
更民主的方法
More democratic.

799
01:17:10,510 --> 01:17:13,890
来最后给观众们微笑一下
Can you look out of the window and wave.

800
01:17:15,930 --> 01:17:18,220
声音还可以吧?
How's the sound?

801
01:17:18,850 --> 01:17:21,720
-你干了些什么  托马索?  -我的使命
-What are you doing, Tomaso?  -My job, sir.

802
01:17:21,730 --> 01:17:23,640
你知道吗?
Do you know sir, what my mission is?

803
01:17:23,650 --> 01:17:26,410
这里是法制社会  人人平等
Law and order in this country is equal for everybody.

804
01:17:26,420 --> 01:17:29,680
我的工作就是提醒那些记性差的人
And I just make sure that nobody forgets it. That's my job.

805
01:17:29,690 --> 01:17:31,420
如果还不明白
If you still can't understand this.

806
01:17:32,820 --> 01:17:35,620
看看电视
Then watch the TV and you'll find out soon enough.

807
01:17:53,260 --> 01:17:56,140
13区已经失去控制  一直在浪费钱
Borough 13 is uncontrollable. The upkeep is too expensive.

808
01:17:56,150 --> 01:17:59,510
纳税人已经怨声载道  养这些无所事事的寄生虫!
People don't want to pay for the scum of society.

809
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:05,300
那就全清洗掉?
So clean up with a bomb?

810
01:18:05,310 --> 01:18:08,210
13区已经失去控制  一直在浪费钱
Borough 13 is uncontrollable. The upkeep is too expensive.

811
01:18:08,220 --> 01:18:12,100
纳税人已经怨声载道  养这些无所事事的寄生虫!
People don't want to pay for the scum of society.

812
01:18:12,110 --> 01:18:13,880
那就全清洗掉?
So you clean up with a bomb?

813
01:18:13,980 --> 01:18:17,280
没错  不太光彩但是很有效
Yeah. Undemocratic, but it solves a lot of problems.

814
01:18:17,290 --> 01:18:21,240
除了你们
Bar one. Yours.

815
01:18:42,480 --> 01:18:44,970
你们真的不待在这边?
Are you sure you don't want to stay?

816
01:18:44,980 --> 01:18:47,470
用那些奖金  可以买套不错的房子
With your bonus you can get a really nice pad.

817
01:18:47,480 --> 01:18:50,390
房子我有  我属于这里
I've got a pad. It's my neighbourhood.

818
01:18:50,400 --> 01:18:53,600
我生在这里  我现在就想平静地生活
I was born here. Maybe it ain't too peaceful but...

819
01:18:53,610 --> 01:18:58,110
会好起来的  雷托  下周一就开始拆这墙了
Relax, Leito. From Monday they're gonna start tearing down the walls.

820
01:18:58,120 --> 01:19:01,860
警察局和学校月底就重开了
By the end of the month, the police and schools will be back.

821
01:19:01,870 --> 01:19:04,990
全靠你!
You glad? It's thanks to you.

822
01:19:05,000 --> 01:19:08,120
我哥哥最棒了  我早就知道了
He's the best in the world. I always knew that.

823
01:19:08,130 --> 01:19:11,450
笑一下  你怎么不高兴
Cheer up! Why so gloomy?

824
01:19:11,460 --> 01:19:14,790
只希望他们不要中途食言
I just hope the Government will carry out their promises.

825
01:19:14,800 --> 01:19:17,060
能遵守承诺的
They've no other choice.

826
01:19:17,070 --> 01:19:20,420
这是投票决定的  政府必须执行
Promises made must always be fulfilled.

827
01:19:20,430 --> 01:19:24,220
就像总有我这样的人来维护秩序
There will always be someone like me to make it happen.

828
01:19:26,270 --> 01:19:30,010
-你保重  -好象我住在这么危险的区
-Take it easy.  -You say that like I live in a dangerous area.

829
01:19:30,020 --> 01:19:32,980
你的区比我的还危险  达绵
Yours is more dangerous than mine, Damien.

830
01:19:32,990 --> 01:19:35,690
或许吧
It's a matter of acclimatising.

831
01:19:36,900 --> 01:19:39,200
时常过来看我们
Come visit.

832
01:19:40,240 --> 01:19:42,530
不能肯定
I'll try.

833
01:19:48,170 --> 01:19:50,880
他会来的
He'll definitely come now.

834
01:19:54,840 --> 01:19:56,720
证件
Welcome.

835
01:19:57,550 --> 01:19:59,220
谢谢
Thanks.

836
01:20:00,220 --> 01:20:00,220
进去吧
Go.
