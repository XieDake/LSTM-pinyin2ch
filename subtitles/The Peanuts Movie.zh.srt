00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,486
啊 贝多芬
Ah, Beethoven.

8
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:45,009
莱纳斯 该起床啦
Linus, time to get up.

9
00:01:45,160 --> 00:01:47,481
你可不想上学迟到吧
You don't want to be late for school.

10
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:48,961
- 起床!  - 啊!
- Get up!  - Ah!

11
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:51,203
我的毯子!
My blanket!

12
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:55,370
喂?
Hello?

13
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:56,771
下雪了?
Snow day?

14
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:58,365
下雪啦!
Snow day!

15
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,644
今天不用上学!
No school today!

16
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:03,923
美梦成真啦!
Dreams do come true!

17
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,209
不用上学!
No school!

18
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,727
富兰克林和薄荷·派蒂来我这一队!
Franklin and Peppermint Patty are on my team!

19
00:02:12,880 --> 00:02:14,962
- 我拿了曲棍球棍!  - 我拿了冰鞋!
- I got my hockey stick!  - I got my skates!

20
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,167
谁有冰球?
Who has the pucks?

21
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:17,850
今天看起来不错哟 乒乓
Looking sharp today, Pigpen.

22
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,001
抱歉来迟了
Sorry I'm late. 

23
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,929
他怎么那么磨蹭?
Ew! What's taking him so long?

24
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:23,003
快点 查理·布朗!
Come on, Charlie Brown!

25
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:26,324
不 还不行 就这件! 
No. Not quite. That's the one!

26
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:28,321
诶哟!
Whoa! 

27
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:37,845
我拿了风筝!
I've got my kite!

28
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:40,247
就是今天了 我感受到了!
Today's the day. I can feel it!

29
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,686
风筝? 今天放?
A kite? Today?

30
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:43,080
在大冬天的?
In the middle of winter?

31
00:02:43,240 --> 00:02:44,287
来吧 小伙伴们!
Come on, guys!

32
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:46,204
只有查理·布朗干得出来
Only Charlie Brown.

33
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,840
一个新风筝 一阵刚好的轻风
A new kite, a perfect breeze.

34
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,570
一切都如此完美
It all feels just right.

35
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:54,446
既然吃风筝的树已经冬眠
Now that the Kite-Eating Tree is sleeping for the winter...

36
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,045
我们就没什么好怕啦
we have nothing to fear.

37
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,406
起飞!
Lift off!

38
00:03:07,240 --> 00:03:08,241
等一下
Wait a minute.

39
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,324
它升空啦 它在飞! 伙伴们!
It's in the air. It's flying! Hey, guys!

40
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:13,687
快看 看呐 我做到了!
Look! Look, I did it!

41
00:03:20,960 --> 00:03:22,007
嘿 查理·布朗
Hey, Charlie Brown.

42
00:03:22,160 --> 00:03:23,889
还是这么倒霉 是吧?
Still no luck, huh? 

43
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:25,690
记住 继续下去的勇气
Remember, it's the courage

44
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,489
才是重要的! 哎哟!
to continue that counts! Whoa!

45
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:29,440
风筝失控啦!
Runaway kite!

46
00:03:29,880 --> 00:03:31,480
抱歉!
Sorry!

47
00:03:35,520 --> 00:03:36,601
它停不下来了!
No brakes!

48
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:39,890
现在轮到我的阿克塞尔三周跳了
And now, for my famous triple Axel!

49
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:41,929
震惊吧!
Prepare to be amazed!

50
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:43,805
天哪!
Ooh!

51
00:03:43,880 --> 00:03:45,689
四周跳! 好棒!
A quadruple! Bravo!

52
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:53,086
可恶的吃风筝树
Stupid Kite-Eating Tree.

53
00:03:55,960 --> 00:03:57,200
真要命
Good grief.

54
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,570
你这木鱼脑袋!
You blockhead!

55
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:01,364
我早该知道
I should have known.

56
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:04,330
什么人才会想在大冬天
What kind of a person tries to fly a kite

57
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:06,164
放风筝呢?
in the middle of winter?

58
00:04:06,320 --> 00:04:08,129
你怎么都不会放弃的?
Don't you ever know when to give up?

59
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:11,124
你的风筝永远也飞不上天的
You will never get that kite to fly.

60
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,171
为什么? 因为你是查理·布朗!
Why? Because you're Charlie Brown!

61
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:21,601
谢谢 莱纳斯
Thanks, Linus.

62
00:04:21,760 --> 00:04:22,921
听着 查理·布朗
Listen, Charlie Brown.

63
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:25,367
就是因为不听我姐姐露西那些话
Ignoring what my sister Lucy says

64
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,568
我才走得到今天
has enabled me to make it this far in life.

65
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:30,485
要是没有像你这样的好朋友我该怎么办呢?
What would I do without a good friend like you?

66
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:31,720
哇哈!
Whoa!

67
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:34,841
哇哦!
Whoa!

68
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:38,566
天哪 我的小可爱!
Aw, my Sweet Babboo!

69
00:04:40,040 --> 00:04:42,441
他咋能这么可爱?
Isn't he the cutest thing?

70
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:45,727
小心 伙计!
Careful, sir!

71
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:52,604
别碰我的卷发!
Watch the curls!

72
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,370
我才不管露西说什么
I don't care what Lucy says.

73
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:24,126
也许过去我风筝放的很糟糕...
I may have had troubles in the past flying a kite...

74
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,487
也许我从没赢过一场棒球比赛...
and I may have never won a baseball game...

75
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:29,001
但是爱拼才会赢
but it's not for the lack of trying.

76
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:31,050
只要我日复一日到土墩上投球
My pitching has to improve

77
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,090
我的投球技术一定会进步
if I come out here to my trusty mound every day.

78
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,368
查理·布朗永不言弃
Charlie Brown is not a quitter.

79
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,608
九局下半 两人出局 
Bottom of the 9th. Two outs.

80
00:05:50,480 --> 00:05:52,608
{\an8}（棒球比赛挽回局势的最后的机会 意味着主队暂时平局或落后）

81
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:55,684
三振出局就能成就一个英雄投手
A strike-out here would make the pitcher an instant hero.

82
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:55,684
{\an8}（三振出局：投手通过投球使击球员三击不中而出局的防守行为）

83
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:00,929
成败在此一投
It all comes down to this one pitch.

84
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:14,367
让我看看你能否招架我的快球
Let's see if you can handle my fastball.

85
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:16,642
一号 快速直球
Ol' Number One. The Heater.

86
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:18,040
布朗号子弹
The Brown Bullet.

87
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:30,441
哇哈哈!
Woo-hoo!

88
00:06:32,760 --> 00:06:33,761
啊?
Hmm?

89
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,324
注定是个难度过的冬天
It's going to be a long winter.

90
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:56,441
有人要搬到
Someone's moving in

91
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:57,600
我家街对面了吗?
across the street from me?

92
00:06:57,720 --> 00:06:59,880
伙伴们 看! 有新伙伴要搬过来啦!
Hey, gang, look! There's a new kid moving in!

93
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:01,922
大哥哥 淡定!
Big brother, pull yourself together!

94
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:03,809
快来 查理·布朗!
Come on, Charlie Brown!

95
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:05,962
- 让开!  - 伙伴们
- Get out of the way!  - Hey, guys.

96
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:07,800
你们看到什么了? 谁来了?
What do you see? Who is it? 

97
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:11,001
我好像看到一架钢琴! 希望他也喜欢贝多芬!
Oh, I think I see a piano! I hope he loves Beethoven!

98
00:07:11,200 --> 00:07:12,770
贝多芬 傻多芬
Beethoven, Schmeethoven.

99
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:16,243
也许他能欣赏我的天生丽质
Maybe he will appreciate my natural beauty.

100
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:17,561
谁会在意那个?
Who cares about that?

101
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:19,682
只要他是个比玛茜好的守门员就行
As long as he's a better goalie than Marcie.

102
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:21,046
你伤到我了 先生
You're hurting me, sir.

103
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:22,770
抱歉 但我是说实话
I'm sorry, but it's true.

104
00:07:22,840 --> 00:07:24,729
不 我是说你扯到我头发了!
No, you're pulling on my hair!

105
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:26,410
我只希望他对南瓜大王
I just hope he'll have an open mind

106
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:27,521
没什么偏见
about the Great Pumpkin.

107
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:27,521
{\an8}（莱纳斯每个万圣夜都会在南瓜地里等待南瓜大王的降临 因此被小伙伴们嘲笑）

108
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,250
好像他们有一个面包机!
I think they have a toaster!

109
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,729
我只愿这个新来的没听说过我
I just hope this new kid has never heard of me.

110
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,730
这样他就对我过去的种种不顺一无所知
He would know nothing of my past imperfections.

111
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,248
改过自新的机会
It's not often you get the opportunity

112
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,362
可不常有
to start over with a clean slate.

113
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,688
这一次 一切将会不同
This time, things will be different.

114
00:07:43,760 --> 00:07:45,046
哇哦!
Whoa!

115
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:52,727
是他干的!
He did it! 

116
00:08:03,040 --> 00:08:04,041
史努比...
Snoopy...

117
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:07,568
为什么我每次的努力都事与愿违?
why is it that everything I try turns out wrong?

118
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:10,690
有时我想小伙伴们是不是真的喜欢我
Sometimes I wonder if the kids really like me.

119
00:08:11,080 --> 00:08:14,971
也许那个新朋友会看到真正的我 就像你看到的
Maybe that new kid will see me for who I really am, like you.

120
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,408
狗狗不会试图左右或评价你
A dog doesn't try to give advice or judge you.

121
00:08:18,600 --> 00:08:20,762
他们爱的只是纯粹的你
They just love you for who you are.

122
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:22,241
能有一个静静坐在身边
It's nice to have someone

123
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:24,362
听你说话的伙伴真好
that will just sit and listen to you.

124
00:08:28,600 --> 00:08:30,921
人类最好的朋友
Man's best friend.

125
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:34,884
你可上不了学 史努比
You can't come to school, Snoopy.

126
00:08:35,040 --> 00:08:37,566
当只乖乖狗回家吧
Now be a good dog and go home.

127
00:08:38,720 --> 00:08:40,768
啊哈
Hmm.

128
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:51,004
狗狗不得入内!
No dogs allowed!

129
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,451
我好像看到新伙伴了
I think I saw the new kid.

130
00:08:58,640 --> 00:08:59,846
你看到那个搬家车来了吗?
Did you see that moving truck arrive?

131
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:01,888
你觉得会是谁呢?
Who do you suppose it will be?

132
00:09:01,960 --> 00:09:03,485
新孩子来啦!
The new kid is coming!

133
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:05,887
那可不是新来的
That's not the new kid.

134
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:07,610
嘿 查理·布朗
Hey, Charlie Brown.

135
00:09:11,320 --> 00:09:13,368
早上好 莱纳斯 你拿着什么呢?
Good morning, Linus. What do you have there?

136
00:09:13,520 --> 00:09:15,363
轮到我上台讲故事啦
It's my turn for show and tell today.

137
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:18,524
这个是飞行员里奇特霍芬同款飞机
This is the same plane flown by Manfred von Richthofen.

138
00:09:18,680 --> 00:09:20,170
- 谁?  - 红男爵
- Who?  - The Red Baron.

139
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:20,170
{\an8}(德国 "红男爵" 曼弗雷德.冯.里奇特霍芬在第一次世界大战中
共击落80架飞机 位居德国飞行员之首 同时也是一战中世界王牌的第一位)

140
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:23,051
世界大战中最有名的飞行员
The most famous aviator during The Great War.

141
00:09:23,400 --> 00:09:24,481
这是假的吧 是吗?
It's not real, is it?

142
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,800
啊! 我的天然小卷卷!
Aah! My naturally curly hair!

143
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:39,643
快躲 莱纳斯! 啊呜!
Duck, Linus! Whoa!

144
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:43,408
哎呀!
Yikes! 

145
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:47,567
好的 奥兹玛老师
Yes, Miss Othmar.

146
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:51,761
先生?
Sir?

147
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:53,801
先生
Sir.

148
00:09:54,400 --> 00:09:55,561
先生!
Sir!

149
00:09:55,640 --> 00:09:57,210
二! 不 三!
Two! No, three!

150
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:58,641
大概猜到了?
Was I close?

151
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:00,928
还没开始上课呢 先生
Class hasn't started yet, sir.

152
00:10:02,920 --> 00:10:05,446
什么? 新孩子要来我们班了
What? The new kid is joining our class.

153
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,562
她看上去不太像个守门员
She doesn't look like a goalie to me.

154
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:15,125
天哪! 她好漂亮
Wow! She's pretty.

155

莱纳斯 她看了我一眼！

157
00:10:34,400 --> 00:10:37,370
啊 不会又是年度标准化考试吧!

写名字? 好的 老师
Write our names? Yes, ma'am.

查克 你是想偷摸我的手吗?
Chuck, are you trying to hold my hand?

181
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:44,890
你这个小滑头
You sly dog.

182
00:12:44,960 --> 00:12:46,200

Ooh!

183
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:49,407
你好 我是布朗查理

00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,324
我是说 "不理查朗."
I mean, "Barnie Clown."

185
00:12:51,400 --> 00:12:52,680
我是说...
I mean...  

186
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,171

你有过笑的停不下来的感觉吗?
Have you ever had that feeling when you can't stop smiling?

188
00:13:03,480 --> 00:13:04,481
啥?
Huh?

189
00:13:04,920 --> 00:13:07,400
心脏在胸膛里砰砰跳?

190
00:13:07,560 --> 00:13:10,370
你想站起来但是膝盖却软了?

191

然后那个红发小女孩

192
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:15,643
看了你一眼 哇!
glances at you. Whoa!

193
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:18,087
然后生活一切的可能性

194
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,083
都变得如此清晰
become so clear.

195
00:13:20,520 --> 00:13:21,681

And then you realize...

196
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:26,209
她根本不知道你的存在

197
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,527
我为什么来这儿?
Why am I here?

198
00:13:28,600 --> 00:13:30,648
因为我患上了
Because I just came down

199
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:32,768
严重的失败综合症

200
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:35,649
她来了
Here she comes.

201
00:14:35,800 --> 00:14:37,564
我留个好印象的机会来了
This is my chance to make a good impression.

202
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,130
还是明天好了
Maybe tomorrow.

203
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:27,970
这是一个风雨交加的黑夜
It was a dark and stormy night.

204
00:15:30,840 --> 00:15:33,002
在法国乡村的上空...
High above the French countryside...

205
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:37,285
第一次世界大战的王牌飞行员...

207
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:41,441
臭名昭著的红爵士
the infamous Red Baron.

208
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:52,361
嘘
Shh.

209
00:17:04,840 --> 00:17:07,241
关键点在于不让她发现
The key is keeping a low profile.

210
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:09,762
现在 我们只需要保持距离
For now, we just keep our distance.

211
00:17:14,600 --> 00:17:16,762
啊! 史努比!
Ahh! Snoopy!

212
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,081
不!
No!

213
00:17:18,280 --> 00:17:19,281
嗷!
Oh!

214
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:22,121
唷!
Phew!

215
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:24,288
差一点
That was a close one.

216
00:17:32,120 --> 00:17:35,442
只要我可以鼓起勇气过去 我就会...
If I could only work up the nerve to go over there, I'd...

217
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:37,170
你在看什么 大哥哥?
What are you looking at, big brother?

218
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:39,288
你疯了吗? 啊?
Are you crazy? Huh?

219
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,241
啊哦
Oh.

220
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:44,163

226

呸!
Yuck!

227
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:11,163
真不敢相信
I can't believe I'm about to talk

228
00:20:11,280 --> 00:20:13,089
我就要和红发小女孩说话了
to the Little Red-Haired Girl.

229
00:20:13,240 --> 00:20:14,526
这种时刻最需要
It's moments like this

230
00:20:14,640 --> 00:20:16,688
挚友在旁了
when you need your faithful friend.

00:20:24,480 --> 00:20:25,481
好啦
Yep. 

232
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:27,443
如果这种时刻你要选择一个人
If there's one person you want by your side

233
00:20:27,520 --> 00:20:28,681
在你身边的话...
at a moment like this...

234
00:20:29,160 --> 00:20:31,003
一定是你忠实的狗狗
it's your loyal dog.

235
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:48,440
你好?
Hello?

236
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:50,330
你好? 哼
Hello? Hmm.

237
00:20:53,000 --> 00:20:54,161
她说 "你好"！
She said, "Hello"!

238
00:21:02,160 --> 00:21:03,969
查理·布朗!
Charlie Brown!

239
00:21:04,120 --> 00:21:06,441
太阳都快落山了你来这里干嘛?
What brings you out here so late in the day?

240
00:21:07,680 --> 00:21:09,842
给我点女孩方面的建议吧 露西
I need your advice on girls, Lucy.

241
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:11,331
你自己就是女孩 对不?
You're a girl, right?

242
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:14,251
现在有一个我想要留下好印象的女生
Let's just say there's this girl I'd like to impress.

243
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:16,846
但是她是个人物 而我并不是
But she's something and I'm nothing.

244
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:18,963
如果是我是个人物 而她并不是
If I were something and she was nothing,

245
00:21:19,040 --> 00:21:20,326
我就能跟她说话了
I could talk to her.

246
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,209
或者 如果我们俩都不咋地
Or, if she was nothing and I was nothing,

247
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:23,526
我也能跟她说话
I could talk to her.

248
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:26,729
但现在是她很厉害而我什么都不是
But she's something and I'm nothing,

249
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:28,729
所以我对她开不了口
so I just can't talk to her.

250
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:30,882
你真可笑 查理·布朗
You're being ridiculous, Charlie Brown.

251
00:21:31,000 --> 00:21:32,729
你也有很多优点
You have much to offer.

252
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:34,041
她有个漂亮的脸蛋
She has a pretty face

253
00:21:34,160 --> 00:21:36,003
漂亮的让我很紧张
and pretty faces make me nervous.

254
00:21:36,160 --> 00:21:38,766
漂亮脸蛋? 漂亮脸蛋?
Pretty face? Pretty face?

255
00:21:38,920 --> 00:21:40,206
我也有漂亮脸蛋!
I have a pretty face!

256
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:42,562
我的脸怎么没让你紧张?
How come my face doesn't make you nervous?

257
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:45,371
你怎么就敢跟我说话 查理·布朗?
How come you can talk to me, Charlie Brown?

258
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:52,123
我想知道俘获她的心的秘诀
I just need to know the secret to winning her heart.

259
00:21:52,720 --> 00:21:55,121
瞅瞅镜子 查理·布朗
Look into this mirror, Charlie Brown.

260
00:21:55,560 --> 00:22:00,088
这就是注定失败的脸 典型的悲剧脸
This is the face of failure. A classic failure face.

261
00:22:00,240 --> 00:22:02,447
你觉得女孩子喜欢失败者吗 查理·布朗?
Do you think girls like failures, Charlie Brown?

262
00:22:02,600 --> 00:22:03,726
这 不
Well, no.

263
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:06,127
女孩们喜欢有成就的人
Girls want someone with proven success.

264
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:07,930
你获得过什么奖项吗?
Have you won any awards?

265
00:22:08,080 --> 00:22:10,162
比如国会荣誉勋章?
Like a Congressional Medal of Honor?

266
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:11,969
或者诺贝尔和平奖?
Or a Nobel Peace Prize?

267
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:14,370
你有什么房地产持有股份吗?
What are your real estate holdings?

268
00:22:14,440 --> 00:22:16,010
你有多方面的才能吗?
Do you have a diversified portfolio?

269
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:17,081
啥?
Huh?

270
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:20,249
让我告诉你这个小秘密吧 查理·布朗
Let me let you in on a little secret, Charlie Brown.

271
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,761
如果你真的想给姑娘们留下深刻印象
If you really want to impress girls,

272
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:25,451
你要向她们展现出成功人士的样子
you need to show them you're a winner.

273
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,090
成功人士? 我?
A winner? Me?

274
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:29,726
露西 你说的有道理
Lucy, you may be on to something.

275
00:22:29,880 --> 00:22:32,247
当然 当我说"你"
Of course, when I say "you,"

276
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,288
你知道我不是指你
you know I don't mean you personally.

277
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:39,283
请付5美分
That will be five cents, please.

278
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:48,330
叮咚 叮咚 叮咚 多好听的声音呀
Nickels, nickels, nickels. What a beautiful sound.

279
00:22:48,560 --> 00:22:51,006
"祝贺你 你踏出了走向成功
"Congratulations. You're now on your way

280
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:52,121
的第一步"
to becoming a winner."

281
00:22:52,280 --> 00:22:56,046
"一 忘记你对自己的所有认知"
"Step 1. Forget everything you ever knew about yourself."

282
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,121
嗯
Hmm.

283
00:22:57,320 --> 00:22:59,448
好的 "第二步
Okay. "Step 2.

284
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:01,290
树立自信"
Project confidence."

285
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:03,051
"站得笔直"
"Don't slouch."

286
00:23:05,960 --> 00:23:09,089
"时刻直视对方的目光"
"Maintain eye contact at all times."

287
00:23:25,640 --> 00:23:27,802
呀哈!
Yeehaw!

288
00:23:29,320 --> 00:23:30,845
驾 我的小马!
Giddy-up, little pony!

289
00:23:31,000 --> 00:23:32,684
呀哈!
Yeehaw!

290
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:34,201
你在干什么?
What are you doing?

291
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:37,887
我准备参加一个大型才艺表演
I'm going to be a rodeo star in the big talent show.

292
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:40,202
等我赢到了一等奖的绶带...
When I win that first-prize ribbon...

293
00:23:40,360 --> 00:23:42,010
所有人都会知道我的名字...
there will be no one who hasn't heard the name...

294
00:23:42,160 --> 00:23:44,891
萨莉·布朗和她可靠的马 扫把柄!
Sally Brown and her trusty horse, Broomstick!

295
00:23:46,160 --> 00:23:49,721
赢得才艺表演 是个好主意
Win the talent show. Now that's a great idea.

296
00:23:49,960 --> 00:23:52,531
露西说的就是这个意思
This is just what Lucy was talking about.

297
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:04,201
哈哈!
Ha-ha!

298
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:10,641
哒哒!
Ta-da!

299
00:24:22,760 --> 00:24:23,761
哈!
Ha!

300
00:24:30,840 --> 00:24:31,841
哈哈!
Ha-ha!

301
00:24:34,360 --> 00:24:35,566
我们准备好了
We're ready.

302
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:53,286
哇! 看那个
Whoa! Look at that.

303
00:24:53,600 --> 00:24:55,364
那是查理·布朗么?
Is that Charlie Brown?

304
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:56,441
哇!
Whoa!

305
00:24:58,720 --> 00:24:59,721

她在那
She's here.

307
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:09,609
我有种很好的预感
I have a really good feeling that tonight

308
00:25:09,720 --> 00:25:11,722
今晚她会看到全新的查理·布朗
she will see the new Charlie Brown.

309
00:25:12,400 --> 00:25:13,731
居然是查理·布朗?
Charlie Brown?

310
00:25:13,800 --> 00:25:17,088
作为你的心理医生 我很惊讶看到你来这里
As your psychiatrist, I'm surprised to see you here.

311
00:25:17,280 --> 00:25:19,487
像你这样缺乏安全感的人

反正也没有人看校报
Nobody reads the school paper anyhow.

356
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:13,969
往好处想吧 查理·布朗
Look on the bright side, Charlie Brown.

357
00:28:14,080 --> 00:28:16,970
出名总不是坏事
They say there's no such thing as bad publicity.

358
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:18,281
你说的对 莱纳斯
You're right, Linus.

359
00:28:18,400 --> 00:28:20,767
她现在肯定知道我是谁了
She definitely knows who I am now.

360
00:28:24,280 --> 00:28:27,011
其实 查理·布朗 如果你那么喜欢她...
You know, Charlie Brown, if you like her so much...

361
00:28:27,160 --> 00:28:30,084
为什么不直接去找她跟她做个自我介绍?
why not just walk up to her and introduce yourself?

362
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:31,480
在我昨天晚上

天哪 她在跟他们说话?

So much for a fresh start.

367
00:28:46,200 --> 00:28:48,202
要没有时间了
Time is running out.

368

告诉你自己 "我当之无愧 我能做到"
Tell yourself, 'l am worthy. I can do this."

370
00:28:53,640 --> 00:28:55,280

371
00:28:55,680 --> 00:28:56,806
喂?

379
00:29:15,800 --> 00:29:17,848
毕竟 玛茜要我负责管理

I took it upon myself

382

让你负责做杯子蛋糕

你干了什么? 我不会做杯子蛋糕
You did what? I can't cook cupcakes.

384
00:29:25,480 --> 00:29:27,960
我只会做吐司
The only thing I do know how to make is toast.

385
00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:30,845
而且 我根本就不想去冬季舞会?
Besides, why would I even want to go to the Winter Dance?

386
00:29:31,000 --> 00:29:33,367
吐司和杯子蛋糕! 听起来很不错 查克
Toast and cupcakes! That sounds good, Chuck.

387

It's going to happen.

467
00:35:54,000 --> 00:35:56,000
我就要和那个红头发的姑娘跳舞了
I'm about to dance with the Little Red-Haired Girl.

468
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:00,921
哇!
Whoa!

469
00:36:04,280 --> 00:36:06,442
我们快从这出去!
Let's get out of here!

470
00:36:09,400 --> 00:36:11,004
我认识你么?
Do I know you?

471
00:36:13,440 --> 00:36:15,442
等等! 还没结束呢
Wait! It's not over yet.

472
00:36:20,920 --> 00:36:22,126
谢谢 老兄
Thanks, buddy.

473
00:36:25,920 --> 00:36:27,763
我不想说 史努比...
I hate to say it, Snoopy...

474
00:36:27,920 --> 00:36:30,002
感觉好像我越是努力
it seems like the harder I try,

475
00:36:30,120 --> 00:36:32,122
她就离我越遥远
the further away she gets.

476
00:36:46,200 --> 00:36:48,487
王牌飞行员在空中飞着
The Flying Ace took to the skies.

477
00:36:48,680 --> 00:36:52,844
他无休无止地寻找着那个偷走了他的心的姑娘
He searched endlessly for the girl who had stolen his heart.

478
00:39:06,920 --> 00:39:09,491
白日梦不会成真的 查理·布朗
Daydreaming will not make her materialize, Charlie Brown.

479
00:39:09,560 --> 00:39:11,881
- 她不在这  - 白日梦 我么?
- She's not here.  - Daydreaming? Me?

480
00:39:12,120 --> 00:39:13,406
她星期一会回来的
She'll be back on Monday.

481
00:39:13,560 --> 00:39:15,130
我听说她回了东边去照顾
I heard she went back east to take care

482
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:16,924
她的祖母了 她祖母病了
of her grandmother, who isn't feeling well.

483
00:39:17,120 --> 00:39:18,610
她看起来像是那种
She seems like the kind of person

484
00:39:18,720 --> 00:39:20,051
会做那种事的人
who would do that sort of thing.

485
00:39:21,960 --> 00:39:24,201
哦! 不会又是一份读书笔记吧!
Aww! Not another book report!

486
00:39:24,520 --> 00:39:25,806
该选搭档了
Time to pick our partners.

487
00:39:26,360 --> 00:39:28,601
不要男孩 不要男孩
No boys. No boys.

488
00:39:28,800 --> 00:39:29,961
拜托...
Please...

489
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:31,726
帕蒂! 太棒了!
Patty! Yes!

490
00:39:31,880 --> 00:39:33,086
太好了!
All right!

491
00:39:33,960 --> 00:39:35,803
不 啊哈
Nope. Uh-uh.

492
00:39:36,960 --> 00:39:37,961
就这个了
Yes.

493
00:39:39,600 --> 00:39:41,125
施罗德!
Schroeder!

494
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:45,126
没什么好否认的 都写在卡片上了
There's no denying it. It was written in the cards.

495
00:40:00,640 --> 00:40:03,769
红头发的姑娘 今天真是幸运的一天!
The Little Red-Haired Girl. My lucky day!

496
00:40:03,960 --> 00:40:07,442
这能改变一切 她会看见一个新的我的
This changes everything. She will see the new me.

497
00:40:07,600 --> 00:40:10,001
我们可以一起赢得奖杯!
And together we will win the gold star!

498
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,162
在那之后 什么事情都有可能!
After that, anything is possible!

499
00:40:12,320 --> 00:40:14,482
我们可能是第一个登月的孩子!
We could be the first kids to land on the moon!

500
00:40:14,680 --> 00:40:16,489
孩子们小小的一步...
One small step for kids...

501
00:40:16,680 --> 00:40:18,967
对查理·布朗来说是一大步
one giant leap for Charlie Brown.

502
00:40:22,600 --> 00:40:24,090
你要帮我 莱纳斯
You've got to help me, Linus.

503
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,083
和红头发女孩做搭档
I'm not sure I can handle being partners

504
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:27,605
我不知道我自己行不行
with the Little Red-Haired Girl.

505
00:40:27,760 --> 00:40:29,364
我得慢慢来
I need to slow things down.

506
00:40:29,520 --> 00:40:32,091
也许我还没准备好开始一段认真的感情
Maybe I'm not ready for a serious relationship.

507
00:40:32,280 --> 00:40:33,691
我供养的起她么?
How will I support her?

508
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:36,923
我付不起抵押贷款 如果我用第三方保管账户呢?
I can't afford a mortgage. What if I'm put into escrow?

509
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:40,169
查理·布朗 你太荒唐了
Charlie Brown, you're being ridiculous.

510
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:41,765
我认识的所有人里只有你
You're the only person I know

511
00:40:41,840 --> 00:40:43,365
会把一个简简单单的读书笔记...
who can turn a simple book report...

512
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:45,204
变成一个终身的契约
into a lifelong commitment.

513
00:40:45,360 --> 00:40:48,204
我以前从没有过这么大的担当
I've never been responsible for anything before.

514
00:40:48,360 --> 00:40:51,364
搞砸的话 她的天是不是要塌了!
This could be the worst thing that's ever happened to her!

515
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:57,043
莱纳斯 我只是突然发现
Linus, it just hit me.

516
00:40:57,200 --> 00:40:59,282
我知道怎么去做她的英雄了
I think I know how to become her hero.

517
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:01,727
当她去照顾她祖母的时候...
While she's away taking care of her grandmother...

518
00:41:01,880 --> 00:41:04,850
我独自完成我们俩的读书汇报
I could complete the book report for the two of us.

519
00:41:05,000 --> 00:41:08,482
这样也行 但是如果你想听我的建议...
That's one way to go, but if you want my advice...

520
00:41:10,720 --> 00:41:13,485
他们在公布考试成绩 快过来
They're posting the test scores. Come on.

521
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:16,891
看哪 有人拿了满分 先生
Look. Someone got a perfect score, sir.

522
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:20,010
天才才能拿满分呢
You would have to be a genius to get a perfect score.

523
00:41:20,200 --> 00:41:21,486
我还以为满分是不可能的呢
I didn't know that was even possible.

524
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:22,880
是他! 他来了!
It's him! Here he comes!

525
00:41:23,080 --> 00:41:25,242
之前谁都没得过100分
No one in the world has ever gotten 100 before.

526
00:41:32,400 --> 00:41:33,731
满分?
A perfect score?

527
00:41:33,880 --> 00:41:36,565
我么? 搞错了吧
Me? This can't be right.

528
00:41:36,760 --> 00:41:38,250
不 查理·布朗 看
No, Charlie Brown, look.

529
00:41:38,360 --> 00:41:40,089
你真的得了满分
You really do have a perfect score.

530
00:41:40,880 --> 00:41:43,360
我听说花生酱对大脑有营养
I have heard peanut butter is brain food.

531
00:41:43,560 --> 00:41:44,925
干的好 查克 好孩子
Nice job, Chuck, old boy.

532
00:41:45,080 --> 00:41:47,208
我一直知道你是有潜力的 查理
I always knew you had it in you, Charles.

533
00:41:47,400 --> 00:41:48,447
一定搞错了!
This can't be right!

534
00:41:48,720 --> 00:41:50,165
让开!
Out of my way!

535
00:41:50,360 --> 00:41:52,522
完美先生 查理·布朗?
Mr. Perfect, Charlie Brown?

536
00:41:52,680 --> 00:41:53,920
一定是印错了!
It must be a typo!

537
00:41:54,080 --> 00:41:56,447
我不相信 我不会相信的!
I don't believe it. I won't believe it!

538
00:41:56,600 --> 00:41:58,284
我要求重新核算!
I demand a recount!

539
00:41:58,440 --> 00:42:00,363
中午好 同学们和教职员工们
Good afternoon, students and staff.

540
00:42:00,440 --> 00:42:01,646
我们有件事要特别宣布
We have a special announcement.

541
00:42:01,800 --> 00:42:04,531
周一的早晨将有全校大会...
There will be an all-school assembly Monday morning...

542
00:42:04,600 --> 00:42:07,604
来庆祝我们杰出的同学 查理·布朗...
to celebrate our illustrious classmate, Charlie Brown...

543
00:42:07,680 --> 00:42:10,365
在标准化考试中获得了完美的成绩
who achieved a perfect score on the standardized test.

544
00:42:10,840 --> 00:42:13,207
让下道 天才驾到
Make way. Genius coming through!

545
00:42:13,400 --> 00:42:15,004
我下周有个科学作业要交
I have a science project due next week.

546
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,281
你能给我点意见么?
Can you give me your thoughts?

547
00:42:16,360 --> 00:42:17,805
嗨 我先看到他的!
Hey, I saw him first!

548
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:20,929
他们说你是天才 你会读心么?
They say you're a genius. Can you read my mind?

549
00:42:21,000 --> 00:42:22,161
嗨 别围着他了!
Hey, leave him alone!

550
00:42:22,240 --> 00:42:23,810
对呀 别围着他!
Yeah, leave him alone!

551
00:42:24,040 --> 00:42:27,010
查理·布朗 要写读书报告的话
Now, Charlie Brown, as far as the book report goes,

552
00:42:27,120 --> 00:42:28,770
你推荐哪本书?
what would you suggest?

553
00:42:29,040 --> 00:42:30,644
如果你紧跟经典
Well, you can never go wrong

554
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:31,920
就永远不会出错
if you stick with the classics.

555
00:42:31,960 --> 00:42:33,246
漫画书?
A comic book?

556
00:42:33,360 --> 00:42:35,328
我还以为经典的作品都得是硬皮书
I thought classics had to have hard covers.

557
00:42:35,400 --> 00:42:37,846
听听我们说的这蠢话
Boy, do we feel stupid now.

558
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:45,169
看看 多么现代的作品
Will you look at this. What a contemporary piece.

559
00:42:45,320 --> 00:42:47,322
注意他对空间的运用
Notice his use of space.

560
00:42:47,720 --> 00:42:50,007
你们都疯了么?
Have you all lost your minds?

561
00:42:53,880 --> 00:42:54,881
哇
Wow.

562
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:00,883
你们得了所谓的"非理性恐惧症"
You have what is referred to as an "irrational fear."

563
00:43:01,000 --> 00:43:02,001
哈?
Huh?

564
00:43:02,520 --> 00:43:04,682
喂 小屁孩! 你在干吗?
Hey, kid! What do you think you're doing?

565
00:43:04,840 --> 00:43:07,525
跟随伟人的脚步啊
Following in the footsteps of greatness.

566
00:43:07,680 --> 00:43:08,800
突击!
Breakaway!

567
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:10,330
射门 查理·布朗 射啊!
Shoot it, Charlie Brown! Shoot it!

568
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:17,888
角度太刁钻了 查理
Nice use of angles there, Charles.

569
00:43:18,160 --> 00:43:19,844
干的漂亮 查理·布朗!
All right, Charlie Brown!

570
00:43:19,920 --> 00:43:20,921
嗯
Hmm.

571
00:43:21,080 --> 00:43:24,368
没有光圣诞老人要怎么找到我们的房子啊?
But how is Santa ever going to find our house without lights?

572
00:43:27,600 --> 00:43:28,601
耶!
Yay!

573
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:31,568
就从这里开始
And this is where it all began.

574
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:33,404
作为一个年轻人 他花了很长时间
As a youth, he passed many hours

575
00:43:33,520 --> 00:43:34,760
坐在那张椅子上...
just sitting in that chair...

576
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:37,042
独自沉思
keeping his deep thoughts to himself.

577
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:39,043
这里我们看到的是他早期
And here we have his early kites,

578
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:42,044
- 用于空气动力学研究的风筝  - 哇
- used in many aerodynamic studies.  - Wow.

579
00:43:42,440 --> 00:43:45,364
如果幸运的话 我们可以在他的自然栖息地里看到他
If we're lucky, we'll see him in his natural habitat.

580
00:43:46,040 --> 00:43:47,849
这是他的床
And this is his actual bed

581
00:43:47,920 --> 00:43:50,571
他躺在这里思索生命最伟大的问题
where he lies and ponders life's greatest questions.

582
00:43:50,720 --> 00:43:52,449
喂! 你在干吗?
Hey! What are you doing?

583
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:54,608
我在把你的名气兑现
I'm cashing in on your celebrity.

584
00:44:00,320 --> 00:44:01,526
能给我签个名吗?
Can I have your autograph?

585
00:44:01,600 --> 00:44:02,601
不能
Nope.

586
00:44:03,560 --> 00:44:05,130
今天我的展示是...
And for show and tell today...

587
00:44:05,920 --> 00:44:07,729
我的大哥哥!
my big brother!

588
00:44:21,240 --> 00:44:22,810
呼!
Phew! 

589
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:24,405
好久没见到你了
Oh! I haven't seen you in a while.

590
00:44:24,560 --> 00:44:26,324
我整个人生都改变了 莱纳斯
My whole life has changed, Linus.

591
00:44:26,480 --> 00:44:28,642
突然间 每个人都想跟我交朋友...
All of a sudden, everyone wants to be my friend...

592
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:30,564
然而 我没有真正改变
and yet, I haven't really changed.

593
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:33,610
他们是喜欢原本的我 还是他们想象中的我呢?
Do they like me for who I am, or for who they think I am?

594
00:44:33,680 --> 00:44:36,047
他在那! 查理·布朗 我的国际象棋队需要你!
There he is! Charlie Brown, I need you on my chess team!

595
00:44:36,200 --> 00:44:37,440
他没时间
He's got no time

596
00:44:37,520 --> 00:44:38,521
浪费在无意义的游戏上 他得跟我走
for meaningless games. He's coming with me.

597
00:44:38,680 --> 00:44:39,681
开机!
Roll sound!

598
00:44:39,840 --> 00:44:41,490
- 场记  - 开拍!
- Speed.  - And, action!

599
00:44:42,080 --> 00:44:44,082
你有时间帮我写我的读书报告吗?
Do you have time to help me write my book report?

600
00:44:44,200 --> 00:44:45,201
周一就要交了
It's due on Monday.

601
00:44:45,360 --> 00:44:47,567
周一? 报告周一就要交?
Monday? The report is due on Monday?

602
00:44:47,720 --> 00:44:50,724
她周一就回来了! 我还没开始写呢!
She's back on Monday! I haven't even started yet!

603
00:44:50,880 --> 00:44:52,723
有人知道玛茜在哪吗?
Does anyone know where Marcie is?

604
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:55,042
她跟薄荷·派蒂去溜冰了
She went skating with Peppermint Patty.

605
00:44:55,320 --> 00:44:57,288
布朗先生 布朗先生!
Mr. Brown. Mr. Brown!

606
00:44:57,440 --> 00:44:59,363
我的独家专访怎么办?
What about my exclusive?

607
00:44:59,880 --> 00:45:00,961
停
Cut.

608
00:45:01,280 --> 00:45:02,770
有哈克贝利费恩历险记...
There's Huckleberry Finn...

609
00:45:03,560 --> 00:45:04,971
麦田里的守望者
Catcher in the Rye.

610
00:45:05,120 --> 00:45:08,249
先生 我已经坐在这里好几个小时了
Sir, I've been sitting here for hours.

611
00:45:08,400 --> 00:45:11,131
这些是有史以来最好的书
These are the greatest books of all time.

612
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:12,531
请选一本!
Please just pick one!

613
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:14,284
嗯 睡一觉再想吧 玛茜
Hmm. Let me sleep on it, Marcie.

614
00:45:14,560 --> 00:45:16,562
没有睡觉的时间 先生
There's no time for sleeping, sir.

615
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:17,641
周一就截止了

00:55:28,080 --> 00:55:29,366
查理·布朗
Charlie Brown.

769
00:55:30,280 --> 00:55:33,409
某一刻我变成了英雄 下一刻就变成了一个罪人
One moment I'm the hero, the next I'm the goat.

770
00:55:33,840 --> 00:55:35,444
也许在你上交你的读书报告后
Maybe things will go your way again

771
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:37,648
事情会再次朝对你有利的方向发展
after you hand in your book report.

772
00:55:38,480 --> 00:55:40,244
我不太确定
I'm not so sure.

773
00:55:40,920 --> 00:55:42,251
我为了完成它熬了整整一夜
I was up all night working on it

774
00:55:42,320 --> 00:55:44,243
但我一个字都记不住了
and I can't remember a single word.

775
00:55:44,440 --> 00:55:47,284
肯定不会像你想象的那么糟 查理·布朗
Surely it's not as bad as you think, Charlie Brown.

776
00:55:47,440 --> 00:55:49,283
让我看看你写了些什么
Let me see what you wrote.

777
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:52,684
嗯 呃 哈
Hmm. Mmm-hmm. Huh.

778
00:55:52,760 --> 00:55:54,808
查理·布朗 你对如此复杂小说的
Charlie Brown, the insight you bring

779
00:55:54,920 --> 00:55:57,685
洞察力无可挑剔
to such a complex novel is beyond reproach.

780
00:55:57,840 --> 00:55:59,604
以这份读书报告的质量
You two are sure to win the gold star

781
00:55:59,680 --> 00:56:01,842
你们两个是注定要赢得金星星的
with a book report of this quality.

782
00:56:02,040 --> 00:56:03,440
读书报告?
Book report?

783
00:56:03,760 --> 00:56:05,888
我们要写读书报告吗?
Were we supposed to do a book report?

784
00:56:06,440 --> 00:56:09,046
哦! 嗨 由于你当时不在...
Oh! Hi. In light of the fact that you were away...

785
00:56:09,200 --> 00:56:11,043
查理·布朗主动承担了
Charlie Brown took it upon himself

786
00:56:11,120 --> 00:56:13,009
为你们两人完成读书报告的重任
to complete the report for the both of you.

787
00:56:13,160 --> 00:56:15,367
我不得不说 这是我读过的...
And I must say, this is one of the finest bits...

788
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:17,568
最好的分析文章
of literary analysis I have ever read.

789
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:29,961
啊!
Aaugh!

790
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,968
不 不 不!
No, no, no!

791
00:56:39,800 --> 00:56:42,167
哦 真要命
Oh, good grief.

792
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:46,004
可能我们可以把它粘起来?
Maybe we can fix it?

793
00:56:54,480 --> 00:56:57,484
第四章 诅咒你 红色男爵!
Chapter 4. Curse you, Red Baron!

794
00:58:24,240 --> 00:58:25,241
呼!
Phew!

795
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:08,806
王牌飞行员无畏地
The Flying Ace set out across the hostile

796
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:11,531
朝着敌人的领地进发
countryside undeterred.

797
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:46,128
每当我感到真正的孤独时
Whenever I feel really alone,

798
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:49,084
我总会坐下来注视夜空
I just sit and stare into the night sky.

799
01:00:49,400 --> 01:00:52,609
我总是觉得那些星星之中有一颗是我的...
I've always thought that one of those stars was my star...

800
01:00:52,800 --> 01:00:54,689
每当这时
and at moments like this,

801
01:00:54,760 --> 01:00:57,730
我就知道那里永远有我的星星
I know that my star will always be there for me.

802
01:00:57,920 --> 01:01:02,084
就想一个令人舒服的声音在说, "不要放弃 孩子"
Like a comforting voice saying, "Don't give up, kid."

803
01:01:06,800 --> 01:01:09,849
如果王牌飞行员是来营救菲菲的话
The Flying Ace had to return to the aerodrome...

804
01:01:10,000 --> 01:01:12,082
他就必须返回机场...
if he was ever to rescue Fifi.

805
01:01:35,600 --> 01:01:36,681
嗨
Hey.

806
01:02:16,840 --> 01:02:17,921
嘘
Shh.

807
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:20,567
等我的提示
Wait for my cue.

808
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:22,404
我们想成功的话时间就至关重要
Timing is crucial if we're going to succeed.

809
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:23,561
他们不会想到我们会来
They'll never expect us.

810
01:02:23,640 --> 01:02:25,369
盯住我 等我的信号
Eyes on me and wait for my signal.

811
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:29,401
圣诞节到了
Christmas time is here

812
01:02:30,320 --> 01:02:34,166
开心又快乐
Happiness and cheer

813
01:02:40,680 --> 01:02:44,844
好吧 查克 你家的小疯狗又来了
Yeah, Chuck, your crazy dog is over here again.

814
01:03:21,640 --> 01:03:22,641
啊!
Aww!

815
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:26,931
抱歉 先生 你放过风筝吗?
Excuse me, mister. Have you ever flown a kite?

816
01:03:28,280 --> 01:03:32,126
事实上 我想说...
Well, actually, let me just say that...

817
01:03:32,280 --> 01:03:34,886
我有很多年放风筝的经验 但是我...
I have years of experience with kites, but I...

818
01:03:35,080 --> 01:03:36,320
那太好了!
That's great!

819
01:03:36,560 --> 01:03:39,086
哦! 好吧
Oh! Well, okay.

820
01:03:39,240 --> 01:03:42,403
问题是 不是每个人都擅长放风筝
The thing is, flying a kite isn't for everyone.

821
01:03:42,560 --> 01:03:44,562
只有特定的一类人才可以放好
It takes a certain type of person.

822
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:46,609
这有时会令人沮丧
It can frustrating at times.

823
01:03:46,760 --> 01:03:48,250
风筝好像都有自己的想法
They tend to have a mind of their own.

824
01:03:48,400 --> 01:03:50,880
但是只要有决心和投入
But with determination and dedication,

825
01:03:50,960 --> 01:03:52,086
你也可以做到
you can make it happen.

826
01:03:52,200 --> 01:03:53,201
真的吗?
Really?

827
01:03:53,280 --> 01:03:56,090
给 你拿着绳子 站好
Here. You hold the string. Plant your feet.

828
01:03:56,240 --> 01:03:58,288
重心向前 弯曲膝盖
Weight forward. Knees bent.

829
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:00,608
背挺直 抬头
Back straight. Head up.

830
01:04:00,760 --> 01:04:02,842
记住 放轻松
And remember, keep it simple.

831
01:04:03,760 --> 01:04:04,841
好 
Okay.

832
01:04:05,000 --> 01:04:07,446
我一说"开始" 你就尽可能快地跑
When I say "go," run as fast as you can.

833
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:09,125
往哪边 老师?
Which way, mister?

834
01:04:13,600 --> 01:04:15,443
那边 现在 开始!
That way. Now, go!

835
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:21,046
我希望这个小家伙
I hope the little guy

836
01:04:21,120 --> 01:04:22,531
不会灰心 史努比
doesn't get discouraged, Snoopy.

837
01:04:22,800 --> 01:04:25,121
他还不清楚这会有多困难
He doesn't quite know how difficult this will be.

838
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:26,481
他可能要花费数年的时间
It may take him years

839
01:04:26,600 --> 01:04:28,204
来达到我这种资历水平
to gain my level of experience.

840
01:04:28,360 --> 01:04:29,560
罗马可不是一天...
It doesn't just happen over...

841
01:04:29,600 --> 01:04:30,886
哈?
Huh?

842
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:33,327
呜呼! 飞起来了!
Woo-hoo! It's flying!

843
01:04:33,720 --> 01:04:35,006
哇哦!
Wow!

844
01:04:35,360 --> 01:04:38,364
谢谢你 老师 你真的很会放风筝
Thanks, mister. You sure know your kites.

845
01:04:38,960 --> 01:04:40,644
你想试试吗?
Do you want to try?

846
01:04:48,000 --> 01:04:49,160
你可以的!
You can do it!

847
01:04:49,520 --> 01:04:51,170
别放弃!
Don't give up!

848
01:04:52,240 --> 01:04:53,241
啊哈!
A-ha!

849
01:04:53,800 --> 01:04:56,849
第七章 绝不放弃!
Chapter 7. Never give up!

850
01:04:58,880 --> 01:05:01,201
王牌飞行员知道这将是
The Flying Ace knew this would be

851
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:04,051
他挽回一生所爱的最后机会
the last chance to save the love of his life.

852
01:07:38,480 --> 01:07:39,641
哈?
Huh? 

853
01:08:32,560 --> 01:08:35,245
王牌飞行员与他一生挚爱
The Flying Ace returned to the aerodrome

854
01:08:35,360 --> 01:08:36,600
返回了飞机场
with the love of his life.

855
01:08:36,680 --> 01:08:38,762
如英雄般凯旋
He returned a hero.

856
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:48,241
"就这样 正如我们的英雄所见...
"And so, as our hero observed...

857
01:08:48,400 --> 01:08:49,731
"他注定要再次面对
"he was destined to face

858
01:08:49,800 --> 01:08:52,371
"臭名昭著的红男爵"
"the infamous Red Baron another day."

859
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:54,050
会飞的狗?
A dog that flies?

860
01:08:54,200 --> 01:08:56,726
这是我读过的最蠢的东西了!
This is the dumbest thing I have ever read!

861
01:09:05,760 --> 01:09:08,286
啊! 我染上狗细菌了!
Ugh! I got dog germs!

862
01:09:14,120 --> 01:09:15,929
来啊 查理·布朗!
Come on, Charlie Brown!

863
01:09:16,920 --> 01:09:19,491
今天要与众不同 开始了
Today calls for something special. Here we go.

864

今天是学校最后一天!
It's the last day of school!

866
01:09:25,000 --> 01:09:27,321
大哥哥 你能相信吗?
Well, big brother, can you believe it?

867
01:09:27,480 --> 01:09:30,211
不用读书 写字 做算术了
No more reading, writing, arithmetic.

868
01:09:30,280 --> 01:09:32,123
再也不用学习了!
No more learning ever!

869
01:09:32,280 --> 01:09:33,611
你说什么呢?
What are you talking about?

870
01:09:33,680 --> 01:09:35,444
这只是暑假开始而已
This is just the start of summer vacation.

871
01:09:35,600 --> 01:09:37,602
你还要再读八年的初中
You have eight more years of grammar school.

872
01:09:37,760 --> 01:09:39,091
四年高中
Four more years of high school.

873
01:09:39,160 --> 01:09:41,288
- 八...  - 加上四年的大学
- Eight... - Plus four more years of college.

874
01:09:41,360 --> 01:09:44,284
- 加四  - 还有另外一到四年的...
- Plus four.  - Add the one to an extra four...

875
01:09:44,680 --> 01:09:48,287
这超过三十七年学啊!
That's over 37 years of school!

876
01:09:48,440 --> 01:09:51,489
到时我就又秃又皱了
I'll be bald and wrinkly by then.

877
01:09:55,440 --> 01:09:56,771
哇哦 快看啊!
Wow. Look at that!

878
01:09:57,360 --> 01:09:58,521
那是史努比吗?
Is that Snoopy?

879
01:10:02,320 --> 01:10:03,321
好幸运
Lucky.

880

好了 大家 听好了
Okay, everyone, listen up.

881

我知道这是学校最后一天了...
I know this is the last day of school...

882
01:10:12,320 --> 01:10:13,321
耶!
Yay!

但首先 在离开之前...
But first, before we leave...

884
01:10:16,280 --> 01:10:18,044
我们得为今年的
we need to finish picking our partners

885
01:10:18,120 --> 01:10:20,009
暑假笔友项目选好搭档
for this year's summer pen-pal project.

886
01:10:20,320 --> 01:10:22,129
我抽出一个名字
When I draw a name,

887
01:10:22,200 --> 01:10:23,964
如果你想成为他的搭档 就站起来
stand if you want to be their partner.

888
01:10:25,640 --> 01:10:28,723
开始咯 下一个名字是... 邋遢鬼乒乓!
Here we go. The next name is... Pigpen!

889
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:32,566
我愿意 一点泥巴没有害处
I will. A little dirt never hurt anyone.

890
01:10:32,840 --> 01:10:33,841
施罗德
Schroeder.

891
01:10:34,040 --> 01:10:35,405
我愿意!
I do!

892
01:10:35,880 --> 01:10:37,803
我是说 我同意
I mean, I will.

893
01:10:40,160 --> 01:10:41,321
查理·布朗
Charlie Brown.

894
01:10:44,680 --> 01:10:46,170
我愿意
I will.

895
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:50,120
她愿意?
She will? 

896
01:10:56,040 --> 01:10:57,690
暑假咯!
Summertime!

897
01:11:01,440 --> 01:11:02,441
嗨!
Hi!

898
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:07,249
查理·布朗 你去哪了?
Charlie Brown, where have you been?

899
01:11:07,400 --> 01:11:09,528
今天是暑假第一天
It's the first day of summer.

900
01:11:09,680 --> 01:11:12,206
你应该下来跟大家一起玩耍
You should be down there having fun with everyone else.

901
01:11:12,360 --> 01:11:14,840
我没办法不去想 莱纳斯
I can't stop thinking about it, Linus.

902
01:11:15,040 --> 01:11:16,849
在她目睹了今年
After all the humiliating disasters

903
01:11:16,920 --> 01:11:18,524
所有丢人的灾难后...
she witnessed this year...

904
01:11:18,680 --> 01:11:20,250
她为什么还选我?
why would she choose me?

905
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:22,129
她是在可怜我吗?
Was she feeling sorry for me?

906
01:11:22,280 --> 01:11:23,645
我不想她是因为
I don't want her to choose me

907
01:11:23,720 --> 01:11:25,768
可怜我才选我
just because she was feeling sorry for me.

908
01:11:25,920 --> 01:11:28,446
我这点自尊还是有的
I have slightly more dignity than that.

909
01:11:28,600 --> 01:11:29,886
查理·布朗...
Charlie Brown...

910
01:11:30,040 --> 01:11:33,089
或许是时候想想那微小的可能了...
it might be time to consider the wild possibility...

911
01:11:33,240 --> 01:11:36,369
你是个好人 大家喜欢你
that you're a good person and that people like you.

912
01:11:37,080 --> 01:11:38,491
但你也知道 你永远不会
But, you know, you'll never

913
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:39,925
知道真正的答案 除非...
really know the answer, unless...

914
01:11:40,080 --> 01:11:41,650
我过去问她!
I just go up and talk to her!

915
01:11:41,800 --> 01:11:44,406
我一直都该听你的!
I should've listened to you all along!

916
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:09,564
哦! 我叫"查理" 呃 "查理·布朗"
Oh! "Charles." I mean, "Charlie Brown."

917
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:11,481
她不在?
She's not here?

918
01:12:12,320 --> 01:12:14,084
正要去夏令营?
On her way to summer camp?

919
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:15,970
所以车还没离开学校?
So the bus hasn't left school yet?

920
01:12:16,640 --> 01:12:18,210
但正要走了?
But it's about to leave?

921

好像全世界都在跟我作对
The whole world seems to be conspiring against me.

929

当然了
Of course I did.

944
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:53,329
在你走之前
Before you leave,

945
01:14:53,400 --> 01:14:55,562
有件事我真的很想知道
there's something I really need to know.

946
01:14:55,760 --> 01:14:59,765
为什么 在班上所有的孩子当中
Why, out of all the kids in our class,

947
01:14:59,840 --> 01:15:02,081
你选了我做搭档?

948
01:15:03,080 --> 01:15:04,525
很简单啊
That's easy.

949
01:15:04,680 --> 01:15:07,684
因为我看到了你的为人

950
01:15:08,600 --> 01:15:11,490
一个不靠谱的 没有决心的失败者?
An insecure, wishy-washy failure?

951
01:15:12,920 --> 01:15:15,082
你根本不是那样的
That's not who you are at all.

952
01:15:15,600 --> 01:15:17,125
我喜欢你在才艺表演的时候
I like the compassion you showed

953

你说你会拿着它 但你真正的意思是...
You say you'll hold it, but what you really mean is...
