这人说房地产市场就是一个大泡沫 \Nthis guy says that the housing market is a giant bubble!

738
00:40:18,040 --> 00:40:20,100
这部分情节和真实情况有些出入\NOK, so this part isn't totally accurate.

这儿说房贷证券的信用违约互换\NHere, they're saying that there's 10-to-1 returns,

745
00:40:37,320 --> 00:40:40,300

00:40:41,050 --> 00:40:43,620
现在房地产市场马上就要崩溃了\Nand the whole housing market is about to collapse.

00:40:44,230 --> 00:40:48,890
对他俩来说 听到这消息简直像猫闻到了腥味一样\NFor Jamie and Charlie, the housing market doomsday prediction was music to their ears!

748
00:40:49,090 --> 00:40:51,090
bgm:《Lithium》by Polyphonic Spree

749
00:40:56,150 --> 00:40:58,480
他俩在杰米家的车库创业起家\NThey had started working out of Jamie's garage,

我们的投资策略很简单\NOur investment-strategy was simple.

没人愿意听到坏消息 所以人们往往低估坏事发生的概率\NPeople hate to think about bad things happening so they always underestimate their likelihood.

753
00:41:10,800 --> 00:41:12,860

他俩发现 市场会低价贩卖 认为不可能发生的事情的期权\NJamie and Charlie found: Markets will sell options very cheaply on things they think will never happen.

756
00:41:20,020 --> 00:41:22,920
这样损失会很小 而一旦得利…\NSo, when they were wrong, they were wrong small. But when they were right.......

757

758
00:41:25,310 --> 00:41:27,310
期权交易的是“买卖权利” 不需要买卖实物

00:41:27,510 --> 00:41:29,510
所以需要的资金量小 可以做空

760
00:41:30,370 --> 00:41:34,040
几年间他们就把11万做到了3千万\NWithin a few years they had turned a 110 grand into 30 million

整个金融系统都在欺诈\NThat we are in a completely fraudulent system.

怎么办呢…\NSo... What can we do? We can....

1433
01:19:53,460 --> 01:19:56,140
2A评级的怎么样 我们压注2A评级的证券\NThe AA-tranches, What if we bet against the AA-tranches?

1434
01:19:56,140 --> 01:19:58,140
谁会拒绝这种赌注 \NWho's not gonna take that bet?

1435
01:19:58,280 --> 01:20:01,360
他们说95%都是3A级别的\NWe know that they say they're ninety-five percent AAA-rated

1436
01:20:01,360 --> 01:20:04,780
其实顶多才有25% 剩下的都是垃圾证券\NBut in reality, they're more like twenty-five percent, some of them are zero percent!

1437
01:20:06,060 --> 01:20:08,780
我们也知道如果最差评级的证券 有超过8%作废\NWe also know that if the bottom-tranches fail at over eight percent

1438
01:20:08,780 --> 01:20:10,960
就会导致最上面的证券也跟着雪崩\NThe upper-tranches are affected and they go to zero.

1439
01:20:11,380 --> 01:20:14,520
所以这些2A级别 顶多就是B级\NI'll bet you right now, that those AA's are actually like B's!

1440
01:20:14,860 --> 01:20:18,040

01:20:23,660 --> 01:20:26,900
是200比1 但他们是根据现在评级来定价\Nis 200-to-1, but they're all taking the ratings of face value

1444
01:20:27,340 --> 01:20:30,600
所以低风险2A的保费很低\NThey're charging penny's on the dollar to bet against Double-A's

1445
01:20:32,020 --> 01:20:34,020
我刚开始觉得你俩是笨蛋\NJust when i start thinking you guys are clowns!

1446

地球人都不会去做空2A级别\NNo-one on the planet is betting against Double-A's

1447
01:20:37,620 --> 01:20:40,280
银行会认为我们嗑药了 或者中风了\NThe banks will think we're either high, or having a stroke

1448
01:20:40,600 --> 01:20:42,400
他们会大方接受我们的所有提议\NAnd they'll take every dime we have to offer!

1449
01:20:45,520 --> 01:20:46,420
绝妙的主意\NKind of brilliant!

1450
01:20:48,700 --> 01:20:50,480
这个点子 只有我们想到了\NThis is what we did, that no-one else thought of.

1451
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:53,200
连马克和麦克都没有做空2A\NNot even Baum or Berry thought to short the Double-A's
