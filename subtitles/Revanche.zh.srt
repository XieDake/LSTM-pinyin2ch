整个墓地人山人海
The whole cemetery full of people.

166
00:21:52,960 --> 00:21:54,439
神父
And the priest...

167
00:21:55,480 --> 00:21:57,152
念的悼词也很优美
Spoke such beautiful words.

168
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:04,558
我该走了
I should get going.

169
00:22:06,040 --> 00:22:07,871
她真的很有人缘
She was real popular.

170

00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:25,478
你想咋的就咋的

174
00:22:26,720 --> 00:22:28,756
我总能填饱肚子的
I reckon there will be something to eat.

175
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:31,753
-不好意思  -没关系

176
00:22:31,960 --> 00:22:32,915
再见

177
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:35,033
是我孙子  阿莱克斯
That's Alex, my grandson.

178
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:36,679
你还有孙子  我都不知道
You have a grandson? I didn't know that.

179
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,075
对  他住城里
Yes. He lives in the city.

180
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:43,278
城里人要么自以为是  要么是泼皮无赖
In the city you end up arrogant or a scoundrel.

181
00:22:44,120 --> 00:22:45,553

我打算载你出去
I was thinking I could pick you up...

00:22:55,680 --> 00:22:57,750
我们可以一起开车去教堂
And we could drive to church together.

184
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,476
你觉得我老的都开不了车了吗
You think I'm too old to drive?

185
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,910
住在同村却开两辆车很不划算
It's silly to drive from the same village in two cars.

186
00:23:38,040 --> 00:23:39,837
您的投资期限是多久

也许是6到7年
Maybe six or seven years...

188
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,195
如果有什么更好的收益

189
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:47,432
当然有  但是不多
There is, but it's not much.

190
00:23:47,680 --> 00:23:50,950
区别在于4%和4.25%
The difference is 4%,4.25%...


191
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:53,151
不过您可能对这更感兴趣

不想

9
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,237
但是你能多赚点钱啊

10
00:25:51,000 --> 00:25:53,833
我想和其他女孩儿在一起  这样比较好

11
00:25:54,240 --> 00:25:56,629
胡说  再好好想想
Nonsense. keep thinking.

00:25:56,880 --> 00:25:58,836
明天我们去看公寓
Tomorrow we'll go see the flat.

13

你知道你的问题出在哪儿吗

14
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:23,076
不知道  我有什么问题
No. do I have one?

00:26:23,720 --> 00:26:25,073
你太温和了
You're too soft.

16
00:26:25,560 --> 00:26:28,552
你想粗暴一点  但个性却并非如此
You want to be tough, but you're not.

17
00:26:29,360 --> 00:26:31,191
人们很快就能看出来
Peole can tell immediately.

18
00:26:31,680 --> 00:26:34,797
其实你不是那种人  这就是你的问题
You don't really belong. that's your problem.

19
00:26:35,280 --> 00:26:36,269
太温和
Too soft.

20
00:26:53,480 --> 00:26:54,833
公寓怎么样
Well, what's the flat like?

21
00:26:55,720 --> 00:26:57,119
比旅馆强点儿
Better than hotel.

22
00:26:57,480 --> 00:26:58,435
你接受那个工作了吗
You taking it?

23

说实话
Tell the truth.

29

我在打银行的主意
I'm doing a bank.

37
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:04,796
什么意思  "打银行的主意"

我走进去  掏出枪来

他们抓不到我的  因为我有周密的计划
They won't catch me because I have a plan.

46
00:28:24,120 --> 00:28:26,236
我了解那个银行  也找到了脱身路线

我们得做点事儿  不能就这样下去

不是一切都很正常吗

闹腾

53
00:28:52,040 --> 00:28:54,713
他打开门跑进树林中
Then he opened the door and ran into the woods...

00:28:54,920 --> 00:28:57,275
我们紧跟着  很快就捉住了他

55
00:28:57,520 --> 00:28:59,590
他吓得屁滚尿流
It was ok, he was scared shitless.

56
00:29:00,440 --> 00:29:02,954
大喊着别开枪
Please don't shoot!

57

像水手那样咒骂着

那次行动时  正好我没当班

62
00:29:26,400 --> 00:29:27,753
谁慢了

00:29:28,160 --> 00:29:28,956
干杯

苏西  我们能自己解决
Susi, no. it'll work out.

75
00:30:31,160 --> 00:30:32,798
要有点儿耐心
We just have to be patient.

女人的直觉

Look, adotion just causes problems later.

对不起  我不是有意的

From behind? through the rear window?

98
00:53:50,959 --> 00:53:52,676
用只格洛克手枪  不可能
With a glock? no.

99
00:53:54,160 --> 00:53:55,559
我瞄的是轮胎
I aimed at the tires.

100
00:53:55,800 --> 00:53:58,075
是啊  是有这种烂事发生的

00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:12,559
是的  简单地说在农场门口

有人抢了银行

我们的银行吗
Our bank?

111
00:57:20,560 --> 00:57:22,676
被罗伯特撞见了  想不到吧
Robert ran into them, just imagine!

112
00:57:23,000 --> 00:57:24,991
他试着逮抢匪  可他们有家伙
He tried to detain them. they were armed.

113
00:57:25,240 --> 00:57:27,390
-我真不想想这事  -罗伯特
- I hate to think about it. - Robert?

114
00:57:27,600 --> 00:57:30,194
-他受伤了吗  -没  感谢上帝
- Was he hurt? - No, thank god.

115
00:57:30,800 --> 00:57:32,150
有人死了
There was a casualty,

116
00:57:32,150 --> 00:57:34,190
明天接你时再告诉你
I'll tell you tomorrow when I pick you up.

117
00:57:36,600 --> 00:57:37,919
这些我最爱吃
I like these best.

118
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:45,113
她丈夫是警察吗
Is her husband a policeman?

119
00:57:45,880 --> 00:57:47,598
黄油我们也要
We need butter too.

120
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:36,630

- Are you coming with us tomorrow? - Where?

121

做礼拜
It's Sunday.

122
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:40,912
不了  我继续干活
No, I'll keep working.

00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:44,518
不会害你的
It sure wouldn't hurt you.

124
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:45,988
我出去散步
I'm going for a walk.

125
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:48,475
-天快黑了  -没关系
- It'll be dark soon. - Doesn't matter.

126
00:58:51,560 --> 00:58:54,597
他觉得夜里散步很正常
He thinks it's normal to go for a walk in the dark.

127
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:36,791
他们在调查枪的使用
Now they are investigating the use of firearms,

128
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:39,151
看我是否属正当开枪
Checking whether it was justified...

129
00:59:39,360 --> 00:59:40,634
废话  当然正当
Of course it was!

130
00:59:41,800 --> 00:59:43,472
他们下了控诉
And they filed a complaint.

131
00:59:44,120 --> 00:59:45,758
控诉你吗
Against you?

132
00:59:46,560 --> 00:59:47,470
谁干的
Who did?

133
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:49,591
区警署
District Police Office.

134
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:50,915
控诉你什么
For what?

135
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:52,954
过失杀人
Manslaughter.

136
00:59:54,120 --> 00:59:55,758
他们还真敢
The nerve of them!

137
00:59:56,760 --> 00:59:59,672
你冒着生命危险  他们却起诉你
You risk your life and they file a comlaint!

138
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:01,239
还是自己人
Your own peole.

139
01:00:01,440 --> 01:00:03,158
这就是制度
That's the system.

140
01:00:03,400 --> 01:00:04,196
多"好"的制度
A fine system!

141
01:00:04,440 --> 01:00:06,112
知道抢匪身份了吗
Do they know who they were?

142
01:00:06,360 --> 01:00:07,873
仍无头绪
Still no leads.

143
01:00:08,520 --> 01:00:10,431
外国人  俄罗斯或波兰的
Foreigners. Russians or Poles.

144
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:11,868
或许是非法入境者
Maybe illegal aliens.

145
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:14,232
她可能是鸡
She might have been a prostitute.

146
01:00:14,440 --> 01:00:16,192
谢天谢地
Good riddance!

147
01:00:20,680 --> 01:00:23,069
他没表露  可压力不小啊
He doesn't show it, but it's a huge strain.

148
01:00:23,920 --> 01:00:25,512
这也难怪  她死了
No wonder, she's dead.

149
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:27,159
糟透了
It's awful.

150
01:00:27,960 --> 01:00:30,474
他一直惦着  我去去就回
He thinks about it constantly. I'll be right back.

151
01:00:38,800 --> 01:00:40,836
别烦了  他无心的
Don't let him get to you, he has no idea.

152
01:00:41,080 --> 01:00:41,956
什么
What?

153
01:00:42,160 --> 01:00:44,037
你爸不知道事情有多严重
Your dad doesn't see how hard this is.

154
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:45,832
是啊  我老爸就这样
Yeah, you know how he is.

155
01:00:46,960 --> 01:00:48,234
我只是冰些啤酒
I'm just cooling some beer.

156
01:00:48,440 --> 01:00:50,317
矿泉水也快没了
We're almost out of mineral water too.

157
01:00:51,160 --> 01:00:52,718
再说  事情没那么糟
Besides, it's not that bad.

158
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:55,593
她死了  我能怎么办
So she's dead. what was I supposed to do?

159
01:00:55,960 --> 01:00:57,951
只能怪运背
It was just bad luck.

160
01:00:58,160 --> 01:00:59,388
你也无能为力
There's nothing you can do.

161
01:01:01,200 --> 01:01:03,316
老爸就这样  让他说吧
You know him. just let him talk.

162
01:01:10,400 --> 01:01:13,517
-我去拿甜点  -好的
- I'll get dessert. - Fine.

163
01:01:22,840 --> 01:01:25,308
猜我碰见谁了  西尔维娅·斯陶戴彻
You know who I ran into? Sylvia Staudacher.

164
01:01:26,000 --> 01:01:27,831
她生了对双胞胎女儿
She has twins. girls.

165
01:01:28,080 --> 01:01:29,672
她们忒可爱了
They are so cute.

166
01:01:30,000 --> 01:01:31,149
是啊  很可爱
Yes, they're adorable.

167
01:01:32,280 --> 01:01:33,269
你们俩呢
What about you?

168
01:01:36,080 --> 01:01:38,958
就你俩更好是吧
What could be better for the two of you right now!

169
01:01:39,160 --> 01:01:41,276
-又不是刻意不生  -房子都有了
- It wasn't meant to be. - House is done.

170
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:43,511
你30多了  生孩子的绝佳时期
You're over 30, the perfect age.

171
01:01:43,720 --> 01:01:44,874
没错  妈妈  我们在试
Yes, mama, we're trying,

172
01:01:44,875 --> 01:01:46,029
可你不能硬逼
But you can't force it.

173
01:01:46,280 --> 01:01:48,271
如有孩子  罗伯特就会忘却悲伤
It would get Robert's mind off...

174
01:01:48,480 --> 01:01:50,675
是的  我知道  我俩都想要孩子
Yes, I know. we want kids.

175
01:01:56,960 --> 01:01:59,520
事实上  生孩子可能性极小
It's highly unlikely, if you want to know the truth.

176
01:02:00,560 --> 01:02:02,596
为啥  你怀过孕啊
Why? you were just pregnant.

177
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:10,071
那显然是极走运的一次
Incredible luck, apparently.

178
01:02:10,360 --> 01:02:11,190
纯属意外
A fluke.

179
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:13,518
难以置信
I can't believe that.

180
01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:15,472
做检查了吗
Did you get tested?

181
01:02:16,720 --> 01:02:17,994
出啥问题了
And what's the problem?

182
01:02:19,080 --> 01:02:20,149
问题不在我
It's not me.

183
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:23,031
那么  是罗伯特吗
Then what, Robert?

184
01:02:25,360 --> 01:02:28,238
简直难以置信  他那么猛
Now that I really can't believe! he's so athletic.

185
01:03:17,640 --> 01:03:19,437
那么多啊
That's quite a pile!

186
01:03:19,640 --> 01:03:21,949
我估计你得花一个月
You'll need a month for that I reckon.

187
01:03:23,680 --> 01:03:25,716
-一周  -真的吗  就一周
- A week. - Really, just a week.

188
01:03:26,000 --> 01:03:28,230
我光看都看累了
I get tired just looking at that pile.

189
01:03:28,440 --> 01:03:29,429
豪斯纳在哪儿
Where is Hausner?

190
01:03:29,640 --> 01:03:30,675
他没在屋里吗
Isn't he inside?

191
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:32,313
没去看
I didn't check.

192
01:03:33,240 --> 01:03:35,151
我打赌有你帮他  他定高兴极了
Bet he's glad someone's helping him.

193
01:03:35,600 --> 01:03:37,670
农场就他孤身一人  真替他可怜
I feel sorry for him alone on the farm.

194
01:03:40,040 --> 01:03:40,950
他来了
Here he is.

195
01:03:41,240 --> 01:03:42,389
你来啦
You're here already.

196
01:03:42,880 --> 01:03:44,279
那走吧
Then let's go.

1
01:03:45,160 --> 01:03:47,310
他不会去  他从小就不信上帝
He's not coming, born and bred a heathen.

2
01:03:47,520 --> 01:03:49,556
真高兴他能为你工作
Be glad he's doing your work for you.

3
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:47,239
不知道我是否还会弹
I don't know if I can still play.

4
01:04:47,480 --> 01:04:50,517
别耍赖  你必须弹  你承诺过的
No fair, you have to play now. you romised.

5
01:04:55,480 --> 01:04:56,595
太久没弹了
It's been so long.

6
01:04:56,800 --> 01:04:58,358
有些事情你一辈子也不会忘
Some things you never forget.

7
01:05:01,920 --> 01:05:03,433
豪斯纳要为我们弹奏一曲
Hausner is going to play for us.

8
01:05:33,560 --> 01:05:35,073
他弹得很起劲
He really played up a storm.

9
01:05:36,640 --> 01:05:39,757
他很久没那么高兴了  简直像变了个人
Hasn't been that happy for ages, he's like a new man.

10
01:05:40,320 --> 01:05:42,675
我想他很乐意有人在农场陪他
I think he enjoys having someone on the farm.

11
01:05:43,560 --> 01:05:44,595
你会呆一阵子吧
Are you staying a while?

12
01:05:45,520 --> 01:05:47,909
不  把柴砍完我就走
No, just long enough to finish the firewood.

13
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:51,035
我想我得走了
I guess I'll be going.

14
01:05:52,040 --> 01:05:54,031
祝你愉快  高兴点儿
Have fun. Fun...

15
01:05:55,320 --> 01:05:56,230
祝你好运
Good luck.

16
01:05:57,080 --> 01:05:58,798
你丈夫不去教堂吗
Your husband doesn't go to church?

17
01:05:59,000 --> 01:06:02,151
他并不热衷此事  他更愿意"走他的路"
He doesn't hold much stock in it, he'd rather run his route.

18
01:06:02,400 --> 01:06:03,310
他的路
His route?

19
01:06:04,440 --> 01:06:05,919
去池塘  然后回来
To the pond and back.

20
01:06:06,160 --> 01:06:06,956
天天如此
Every day.

21
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:51,116
你好
Hi.

22
01:07:03,800 --> 01:07:04,994
我再弹一遍
I'm playing again.

23
01:08:31,160 --> 01:08:32,070
你想她吗
Do you miss her?

24
01:08:34,840 --> 01:08:36,876
独自工作
The work alone!

25
01:08:37,400 --> 01:08:38,799
令人沮丧
It's depressing alright.

26
01:08:50,640 --> 01:08:52,358
但我还会见到她的
But I'll see her again.

27
01:08:52,560 --> 01:08:54,073
不久就会
It won't be long now.

28
01:08:55,240 --> 01:08:56,434
你会再见到她
You'll see her again?

29
01:08:59,160 --> 01:09:00,229
她在等我
She's waiting.

30
01:10:37,800 --> 01:10:39,074
你为什么不给我打电话
Why didn't you call?

31
01:10:39,400 --> 01:10:40,958
打电话  为什么要打
Call? why should I?

32
01:10:41,360 --> 01:10:43,999
都凌晨1点多了  我却不知道你在哪儿
It's past 1 a.m., I didn't know where you were.

33
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:45,673
我不会出事的
Well, nothing happened.

34
01:10:46,080 --> 01:10:47,479
但我还是担心
I still get worried.

35
01:10:49,920 --> 01:10:51,273
我和别的警官在一起
I was with the other officers.

36
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:53,516
我们一直在聊天  连时间都忘了
We were talking. I lost track of time.

37
01:10:53,920 --> 01:10:55,433
-聊什么  -抱歉
- About what? - I'm sorry.

38
01:10:56,840 --> 01:10:57,989
聊些什么
Talking about what?

39
01:11:05,880 --> 01:11:07,359
你们聊了些什么
What did you talk about?

40
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:10,876
没什么特别的  关于工作和最近发生的事
Nothing special. About work and what happened.

41
01:11:13,280 --> 01:11:15,874
你跟别人聊天  为何不跟我聊
You talk to the other men, why not to me?

42
01:11:20,120 --> 01:11:21,553
说了你也不明白
You don't understand anyway.

43
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:25,075
你要是跟我说了  没准我会明白
Maybe if you talked to me I would.

44
01:11:30,760 --> 01:11:33,797
另外  那些人知道这是意外  只是不走运  
Besides, the men know it was an accident. bad luck.

45
01:11:34,800 --> 01:11:36,119
难道我不知道吗
And I don't know that?

46
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:40,358
那你为何要用那种眼神看我
Then why do you look at me that way?

47
01:11:40,840 --> 01:11:42,353
什么  哪种眼神
What? How do I look at you?

48
01:11:43,160 --> 01:11:45,276
你以为我不知道你是怎么想的吗
You think I can't tell what you're thinking?

49
01:11:45,800 --> 01:11:47,358
你以为我不知道吗
You think I can't tell?

50
01:11:49,680 --> 01:11:50,795
我是怎么想的
What am I thinking?

51
01:11:54,240 --> 01:11:55,878
是我射杀了她
That I shot her.

52
01:11:57,000 --> 01:11:59,514
你觉得那是我的错
I can tell you think it's my fault.

53
01:12:00,360 --> 01:12:01,315
什么
What?

54
01:12:03,240 --> 01:12:06,152
你想谈谈  想让我为自己辩解  对吗
You want to talk? Want me to justify myself?

55
01:12:06,440 --> 01:12:08,237
尽管如此  你仍旧不会相信我
Even though you don't believe me.

56
01:12:26,040 --> 01:12:28,793
你刚才的话不是认真的  对吗
You weren't really serious in there, were you?

57
01:12:30,320 --> 01:12:31,673
不是  忘了那些话吧
You're right, forget it.

58
01:12:32,280 --> 01:12:34,430
你不会真的认为我是那么想的吧
You don't really believe that's what I think.

59
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:35,834
不会
You're right.

60
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:39,355
想上床睡觉吗
Are you coming to bed?

61
01:12:40,960 --> 01:12:42,473
我想先把啤酒喝完
I'm just going to finish my beer.

62
01:12:43,653 --> 01:12:44,427
好吧
Okay.

63
01:13:44,400 --> 01:13:46,470
苹果也快熟了
The apples are just about ripe too.

64
01:14:01,080 --> 01:14:01,830

Here,

65
01:14:03,120 --> 01:14:04,155
尝尝这个
Taste this.

66
01:14:08,680 --> 01:14:10,033

是啊  还不错
Yeah, not bad.

68
01:14:13,480 --> 01:14:16,199
冬天最大的好处就是  苹果到处都是
The best winter apples far and wide.

69
01:16:18,280 --> 01:16:20,430
你在为谁演奏
Who are you playing for?

70
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:23,713
豪斯纳一开始演奏  就停不下了
When Hausner gets started, there's no stopping him.

71
01:16:24,120 --> 01:16:25,951
她给我们带蛋糕来了
She brought us a cake.

72
01:17:08,720 --> 01:17:10,153
你刚才吓到我了
Did you scare me!

73
01:17:12,960 --> 01:17:14,951
豪斯纳不让我走
Hausner wouldn't let me go.

74
01:17:16,280 --> 01:17:19,317
他能再弹琴真是太好了  那是他最喜欢的
It's great he's playing again. It's what he loves most.

75
01:17:19,520 --> 01:17:20,794
你想从我们这儿得到什么
What do you want from us?

76
01:17:21,680 --> 01:17:22,874
你什么意思  我什么也不想要
What do you mean? Nothing.

77
01:17:23,080 --> 01:17:25,275
你为什么来这儿  你想要什么
Why do you come here? what do you want?

78
01:17:26,480 --> 01:17:27,913
我只想让他高兴
I figure it makes him happy.

79
01:17:28,120 --> 01:17:30,190
看他在农场上孤独生活  我很同情
I feel sorry for him on the farm all alone...

80
01:17:30,400 --> 01:17:32,197
他不会再孤独了
He's not alone anymore.

81
01:17:35,720 --> 01:17:37,995
你假装我们认识彼此似的
You act like we know each other.

82
01:17:39,240 --> 01:17:40,309
我们认识彼此吗
Do we know each other?

83
01:17:41,080 --> 01:17:41,876
不
No.

84
01:17:42,800 --> 01:17:45,519
我们并不认识彼此  而且最好不要认识
We don't know each other. and it's better that way.

85
01:17:46,000 --> 01:17:47,956
你是不是太粗鲁了
Well aren't you uncouth!

86
01:17:48,160 --> 01:17:49,878
你把事情搞得一团糟
You're turning things upside down.

87
01:17:50,760 --> 01:17:52,478
我希望你离我们远点儿
I want you to leave us alone.

88
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:55,268
蛋糕  音乐  舞蹈  这些我都不想要
Cake, music, dance, I don't want it.

89
01:17:56,600 --> 01:17:58,397
我希望你不要回来
I don't want you coming back.

90
01:17:59,520 --> 01:18:01,033
可以吗
Do you think that's possible?

91
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:07,158
那来我家好了
Then come to my house.

92
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:09,753
今晚我独自在家
I'll be alone tonight.

93
01:18:12,040 --> 01:18:13,109
如果你想来的话
If you want.

94
01:18:17,560 --> 01:18:21,075
天黑以后  从后面进来  就不会被看到了
Wait till it's dark, come around the back so no one sees you.

95
01:18:23,280 --> 01:18:24,315
如果你真想来
If you want.

96
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:45,028
你没有退缩
You didn't chicken out.

97
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:46,236
进来
Come in.

98
01:19:57,320 --> 01:19:59,470
如果我令你感到惊讶  这一点也不奇怪
I wouldn't be surprised if you were surprised at me.

99
01:19:59,680 --> 01:20:00,800
我对自己也感到惊讶
I'm surprised at myself.

100
01:20:01,360 --> 01:20:02,236
喝杯酒吗
Glass of wine?

101
01:20:02,920 --> 01:20:04,751
白酒还是红酒  我都有
White or red? I've got both.

102
01:20:05,000 --> 01:20:05,671
随便
Whatever.

103
01:20:06,000 --> 01:20:07,752
我更喜欢白酒  红酒让人昏昏欲睡
I prefer white, red makes you sleepy.

104
01:20:08,000 --> 01:20:09,513
白酒让人振奋
White perks you up.

105
01:20:09,840 --> 01:20:10,716
那就白酒吧
White's ok.

106
01:20:11,200 --> 01:20:13,156
马上就好  我去开瓶新的
Be right back. New bottle.

107
01:20:14,320 --> 01:20:16,834
这瓶刚才并不满  不像你想的那样
It wasn't full, though. Not that you think...

108
01:20:17,560 --> 01:20:18,993
请坐  别拘束
Sit. make yourself comfortable.

109
01:20:19,200 --> 01:20:20,315
我马上就回来
I'll be right back.

110
01:21:06,400 --> 01:21:08,072
希望你能喜欢
Well, I hope you like it.

111
01:21:08,720 --> 01:21:11,234
我觉得这酒很不错  它我们的必备酒
I think it's quite good. It's our house wine.

112
01:21:11,720 --> 01:21:12,835

谢谢  看起来是挺漂亮的
Thanks. It turned out nice.

116
01:21:25,600 --> 01:21:26,874
警察挣钱很多吗
Do cops earn this much?

117
01:21:27,080 --> 01:21:29,071
不  我开了家商店  双职工
No, I've got the store, double income.

118
01:21:29,320 --> 01:21:32,232
我们攒了不少  还有罗伯特和他朋友的
We did a lot ourselves, Robert and his friends, that is.

119
01:21:32,480 --> 01:21:35,199
我们还从双方父母和银行借了点钱
And we got money from our parents and the bank.

120
01:21:35,400 --> 01:21:38,153
他们拥有房屋的一半产权  楼上归他们
It owns half the house, the upstairs floor.

121
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:39,958
不过  那没关系
But that's ok.

122
01:21:40,160 --> 01:21:41,195
再过几年就还清了
It's just for a few years.

123
01:21:42,720 --> 01:21:44,358
每件物品都很整洁  干净

没错  要知道  我想要个舒适的家

126

当然是  我没什么好抱怨的
Sure, I can't complain.

134
01:22:06,320 --> 01:22:08,072
那你为何还想上我
So why do you want to fuck me?

135
01:22:18,520 --> 01:22:19,999
我猜这是个愚蠢的想法
I guess it was a stupid idea.

136
01:22:20,240 --> 01:22:22,515
我还没想得那么远  抱歉
I didn't really think that far, sorry.

137
01:22:28,760 --> 01:22:30,113
-等等  -等什么
- Wait. - For what?

138
01:23:48,520 --> 01:23:50,909
-我能冲个凉吗  -上楼向右转
- Can I take a shower? - Upstairs on the right.

139
01:24:27,880 --> 01:24:29,233
还想喝一杯吗
Another glass of wine?

140
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:30,237
好的
Yeah.

141
01:24:38,280 --> 01:24:39,474
真舒服
How cozy!

142
01:24:39,680 --> 01:24:41,033
你为什么要这么做
Why are you doing this?

143
01:24:41,280 --> 01:24:42,952
你已经厌烦你的警官了吗
Are you bored with your cop already?

144
01:24:43,200 --> 01:24:44,428
不  他是我丈夫
No, he's my husband.

145
01:24:46,720 --> 01:24:47,755
我只是想做
I just wanted to.

146
01:24:48,000 --> 01:24:49,592
上帝会对你说些什么啊
What does your God have to say?

147
01:24:49,960 --> 01:24:51,359
他能理解我
He understands.

148
01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:53,879
真是个善解人意的上帝
A very understanding God.

149
01:24:54,080 --> 01:24:55,274
你什么意思
What is it?

150
01:24:56,240 --> 01:24:58,117
你就不能友善点吗
Can't you just be friendly?

151
01:24:58,440 --> 01:25:00,874
像正常人那样的举动会让你丢脸吗
Will you lose face acting like a normal person?

152
01:25:01,480 --> 01:25:02,879
你经历过什么事
What happened to you?

153
01:25:06,200 --> 01:25:07,189
你有孩子吗
Do you have kids?

154
01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:09,357
没有
No.

155
01:25:09,560 --> 01:25:10,913
但楼上有个儿童房
But you have a nursery upstairs.

156
01:25:11,120 --> 01:25:12,314
但我们没有孩子
But we don't have any.

157
01:25:16,280 --> 01:25:17,190
我要走了
I'll be going.

158
01:25:25,960 --> 01:25:28,952
你为什么总这样  有人对你做过什么吗
Why are you this way? What did anyone do to you?

159
01:25:31,160 --> 01:25:32,752
你最好还是不知道
Be glad you don't know everything.

160
01:25:35,880 --> 01:25:36,869
你还会来吗
Will you come again?

161
01:27:02,480 --> 01:27:04,072
你干活的确是把好手
You sure can work.

162
01:27:05,200 --> 01:27:06,599
真该给你些奖励
Got to give you credit for that.

163
01:27:12,280 --> 01:27:13,759
你该结婚了
You should get married.

164
01:27:17,560 --> 01:27:20,677
男人需要女人  否则他会变蠢的
A man needs a woman or he gets folly.

165
01:27:22,960 --> 01:27:25,474
以你的工作方式  找个女人应该很容易
You'll find one easily the way you work.

166
01:27:28,120 --> 01:27:30,236
你觉得伐木会吸引女人吗
You think chopping wood impresses women?

167
01:27:34,880 --> 01:27:36,757
她们会格外关注能干的男人
They notice a man who can work.

168
01:27:37,040 --> 01:27:38,598
即使现在也一样
Won't be any different nowadays.

169
01:28:14,760 --> 01:28:16,318
-你好  -你好
- Hello. - Hi.

170
01:29:07,880 --> 01:29:08,790
怎么了
What's wrong?

171
01:29:10,640 --> 01:29:12,198
有点头晕
Just dizzy.

172
01:29:40,640 --> 01:29:41,709
你经常会这样吗
Does this happen often?

173
01:29:43,080 --> 01:29:44,559
是的  有时会
Yeah, sometimes.

174
01:29:46,120 --> 01:29:48,429
把止痛药递给我  好吗
Can you hand me the bag balm?

175
01:29:51,240 --> 01:29:52,958
它对头痛很有效
It works wonders for headaches.

176
01:29:53,200 --> 01:29:54,349
你也会头痛吗
You have headaches too?

177
01:29:54,760 --> 01:29:55,749
一直都这样
All the time.

178
01:29:57,000 --> 01:29:59,036
你应该去做个检查
You should go in for a checkup.

179
01:30:01,320 --> 01:30:03,390
医生也无能为力
Doctors don't know anything either.

180
01:30:03,640 --> 01:30:05,153
看医生又不会有坏处
But it can't hurt.

181
01:30:05,360 --> 01:30:08,113
就是有点头痛  不必看医生
I don't need a doctor for a little headache.

182
01:30:10,320 --> 01:30:11,878
真是个顽固的老白痴
You're a stubborn old fool.

183
01:30:13,440 --> 01:30:15,158
你自己也是个顽固的白痴
You're a stubborn fool yourself.

184
01:30:17,840 --> 01:30:20,035
谁会照看牛群和农场呢
Who will look after the cows and the farm?

185
01:30:20,320 --> 01:30:21,958
我不会离开
I'm not leaving.

186
01:30:22,240 --> 01:30:24,674
最后  他们可以把我抬走
They can carry me out in the end.

187
01:30:24,920 --> 01:30:26,319
到那时就不是我的问题了
It won't be my problem anymore.

188
01:30:26,520 --> 01:30:28,351
但在那之前  我决不离开
But until then, I'm not budging.

189
01:30:28,920 --> 01:30:30,114
直到最后
Till the end.

190
01:30:33,120 --> 01:30:34,235
直到最后
Till the end.

191
01:30:41,800 --> 01:30:42,869
今天就一个人吗
Alone today?

192
01:30:43,680 --> 01:30:45,033
豪斯纳怎么了
How's Hausner?

193
01:30:45,240 --> 01:30:46,036
他很好
He's ok.

194
01:30:46,240 --> 01:30:47,832
替我向他问好
Tell him I said hi.

195
01:30:48,040 --> 01:30:49,632
我今晚还是独自一人
I'll be alone again tonight.

196
01:31:31,480 --> 01:31:34,153
罗伯特  过来  为我儿子干一杯
Hey Robert, c'mon! Let's drink to my son.

1
01:31:34,360 --> 01:31:35,918

祝贺你  -谢谢

6
01:31:47,440 --> 01:31:49,590
把杯子递给我  谢谢
Pass me my glass! thanks.

7
01:31:49,800 --> 01:31:51,756
他昨天3点过来  花了好长时间
He came at 3 yesterday. took forever.

8
01:31:51,960 --> 01:31:54,269
-你一整天都在吗  -当然
-You were there the whole time? - of course.

9
01:33:02,680 --> 01:33:03,874
你总是吓我一跳
You're always scaring me.

10
01:33:04,080 --> 01:33:05,877
快进来  别让人看见了
Come in, what if someone sees you?

11
01:33:08,800 --> 01:33:10,756
我刚才还想你不会来了
I was sure you weren't coming.

12
01:33:11,080 --> 01:33:12,638
我的直觉不行  幸好我也从不和人打赌
Good thing I didn't bet anything.

13
01:33:14,240 --> 01:33:17,198
你总是和狼一样独来独往
Have you always been a lone wolf, coming and going...

14
01:33:17,400 --> 01:33:19,356
抱歉  不过那就是我对你的印象
Sorry, but that's my impression of you.

15
01:33:19,720 --> 01:33:21,153
我不总那样
No. not always.

16
01:33:22,720 --> 01:33:25,234
等处理完这的事后  你就回维也纳吗
Will you go back to vienna when you're done?

17
01:33:29,560 --> 01:33:32,154
你有女友吗  我对你一无所知
You have a girlfriend? I know nothing about you.

18
01:33:33,640 --> 01:33:35,392
有一个  不过最近
I had one until recently.

19
01:33:36,360 --> 01:33:37,395
你们结束了吗
It's over?

20
01:33:39,200 --> 01:33:40,394
出了什么事
What happened?

21
01:33:42,920 --> 01:33:44,319
她被杀了
She was murdered.

22
01:33:46,200 --> 01:33:47,076
什么
What?

23
01:33:48,040 --> 01:33:49,519
她被人杀了
She was murdered.

24
01:33:50,640 --> 01:33:53,234
-我的天哪  -那个杀人凶手
-Oh my goodness. - and the man who did it...

25
01:33:54,880 --> 01:33:55,790
活得好好的

26
01:33:57,480 --> 01:33:58,469
和什么都没发生一样
Just like always.

27
01:33:59,240 --> 01:34:00,468
丝毫没有愧疚
He couldn't care less.

28
01:34:01,560 --> 01:34:03,949
-那不是真的吧  -那就是真的
-That can't be true. - but it is.

29
01:34:04,320 --> 01:34:05,799
凶手好好地活着
He goes on living his life.

30
01:34:07,400 --> 01:34:08,435
而她却死了
And she is dead.

31
01:34:11,400 --> 01:34:14,472
我现在所想的就是要改变这一切
And all I ever think about is that I have to change that.

32
01:34:16,760 --> 01:34:18,990
那凶手不会有好日子过的
He can't simly go on living.

33
01:34:29,080 --> 01:34:31,958
你想知道发生了什么  现在你知道了
You wanted to know what's wrong, now you know.

34
01:34:37,480 --> 01:34:39,914
你不能那样做  连想都不能想
You can't do that. you mustn't even think it.

35
01:34:40,160 --> 01:34:40,910
不能什么
What?

36
01:34:41,160 --> 01:34:43,196
为了复仇杀人
Killing someone out of vengeance.

37
01:34:44,880 --> 01:34:47,189
我知道你不信教  但这是有罪的
I know you don't believe, but it's a sin.

38
01:34:47,400 --> 01:34:48,753
你不能这么做
You mustn't do it.

39
01:34:55,520 --> 01:34:56,919
现在我能理解你了
Now I understand you.

40
01:35:05,000 --> 01:35:06,718
这就是为什么你这么冷酷
That's why you're so cold.

41
01:35:08,480 --> 01:35:09,754
这么残忍
So brutal.

42
01:35:10,560 --> 01:35:11,470
冷酷
Cold?

43
01:35:14,480 --> 01:35:16,038
答应我
You mustn't do it.

44
01:35:16,760 --> 01:35:17,875
你不会杀人的
Promise me.

45
01:35:19,960 --> 01:35:21,359
现在我能够理解你了
Now I understand you.

46
01:35:37,280 --> 01:35:37,917
过来
C'mon.

47
01:36:12,840 --> 01:36:14,478
你现在得走了  罗伯特回来了
You have to go, robert came home.

48
01:36:14,960 --> 01:36:17,076
偷偷溜出去  不要让他看到你
Find your way out. don't let him see you.

49
01:36:17,320 --> 01:36:18,878
也许他倒想见我
Maybe he'd like to meet me.

50
01:36:19,120 --> 01:36:21,918
不要这样  快走吧  不要毁了这一切
Please don't. please go. don't ruin everything.

51
01:36:22,960 --> 01:36:23,836
快走吧
Please go.

52
01:36:28,360 --> 01:36:29,679
怎么这个时候已经到家了
Why are you home already?

53
01:36:30,160 --> 01:36:31,195
出什么事了
What's wrong?

54
01:36:35,880 --> 01:36:37,233
罗伯特  怎么回事
Robert, what haened?

55
01:36:37,840 --> 01:36:39,558
他们让我休假
They gave me a leave of absence.

56
01:36:41,080 --> 01:36:41,990
休假
Leave of absence?

57
01:36:44,000 --> 01:36:45,638
说我不宜执勤
I'm unfit for duty.

58
01:36:47,920 --> 01:36:50,195
咨询师说这种状态很正常
The counselor said it's perfectly normal.

59
01:36:51,120 --> 01:36:53,156
发生这种事理所应当会有此反应
It's a normal reaction to the events.

60
01:36:53,360 --> 01:36:54,679
确实是这样
Sure it is.

61
01:36:56,400 --> 01:36:58,868
他还说我需要心理治疗
And he said I might need psychological help.

62
01:37:00,440 --> 01:37:03,273
我没病  我很正常  遇到这种事每个人都会这样
I'm not sick, it's normal. it's how anyone would react.

63
01:37:03,480 --> 01:37:04,708
这是当然的
That's absolutely right.

64
01:37:08,440 --> 01:37:11,318
-我瞄的是轮胎  -大伙都知道
-I aimed at the tires. - everyone knows you did.

65
01:37:11,640 --> 01:37:12,834
我一直是百发百中
I normally hit my mark,

66
01:37:13,040 --> 01:37:14,951
我也不知道为什么会射偏
I don't know how this could happen.

67
01:37:15,160 --> 01:37:17,151
只是运气不好罢了
It was just bad luck.

68
01:37:18,760 --> 01:37:19,909
运气不好
Bad luck.

69
01:37:21,720 --> 01:37:24,792
为什么我这么不走运
Why am I lagued with bad luck?

70
01:37:28,160 --> 01:37:30,390
为什么我总是射不中
Why can't I do anything right?

71
01:37:37,720 --> 01:37:40,359
我觉得心理咨询是个好建议
I think a sychologist is a good idea.

72
01:37:40,840 --> 01:37:43,354
我情不自禁地去看这张该死的照片
And I can't stop looking at the damn photo.

73
01:37:47,040 --> 01:37:49,679
我搞不明白  我不该是现在这样的
I don't understand, it couldn't have been me.

74
01:37:49,880 --> 01:37:51,029
什么照片
What photo?

75
01:37:53,120 --> 01:37:54,439
那女人的
Of the woman.

76
01:37:55,400 --> 01:37:56,719
你有她的照片
You have a photo of her?

77
01:38:03,760 --> 01:38:05,113
你从哪里搞来的
Where did you get this?

78
01:38:11,640 --> 01:38:13,039
我瞄的是轮胎
I aimed at the tires.

79
01:38:13,280 --> 01:38:14,554
你不该再拿着它
You shouldn't have this.

80
01:38:15,080 --> 01:38:16,149
不要再看这张照片了
Shouldn't be looking at it.

81
01:38:18,840 --> 01:38:20,831
现在我去把它扔了  好吗
I'm going to throw it away now. ok?

82
01:38:23,800 --> 01:38:25,472
那我去扔了
I'm throwing the photo away.

83
01:40:27,400 --> 01:40:28,435
怎么了
What's wrong?

84
01:40:31,840 --> 01:40:33,273
现在好点了
I'm ok now.

85
01:40:35,640 --> 01:40:36,755
你该上床休息
You belong in bed.

86
01:40:39,760 --> 01:40:41,034
嗯  也许是吧
Yeah, maybe.

87
01:40:56,200 --> 01:40:57,553
明天我就会好的
I'll be fine tomorrow.

88
01:40:58,920 --> 01:41:00,319
你需要去医院
You need a checkup.

89
01:41:00,560 --> 01:41:01,549
检查身体
At a hospital.

90
01:41:03,880 --> 01:41:06,348
我不在的话  这里会一团糟
Things will fall apart if I'm not here.

91
01:41:07,200 --> 01:41:08,679
所有一切都会不成样子
Everything will go to ruin.

92
01:41:08,880 --> 01:41:10,233
没有东西会不成样子的
Nothing will go to ruin.

93
01:41:11,560 --> 01:41:12,595
我会待在这
I'll stay here.

94
01:41:13,480 --> 01:41:14,913
照看所有东西
I'll keep an eye on everything.

95
01:41:17,280 --> 01:41:18,474
你待在这吗
You'll stay here?

96
01:41:24,960 --> 01:41:26,598
我不会去医院的
I'm not going to any hosital.

97
01:41:27,600 --> 01:41:29,556
进了医院就别想再出去了
They never let you out again,

98
01:41:30,240 --> 01:41:32,071
那里的人会把我送到收养所
And then they put you in a home.

99
01:41:33,280 --> 01:41:34,793
我要留在农场
I'm staying on the farm.

100
01:41:37,000 --> 01:41:38,718
这里的人会带我出去溜达
They can carry me out.

101
01:41:40,600 --> 01:41:41,999
你还没到要死的时候
You're not dying yet.

102
01:41:43,040 --> 01:41:44,268
休息一会儿
Rest a little.

103
01:41:44,520 --> 01:41:45,669
我们过一会儿就走
We'll go in a bit.

104
01:41:45,880 --> 01:41:47,598
我顺便去喂下牛
I'll feed the cows in the meantime.

105
01:43:11,360 --> 01:43:12,156
你好
Hello.

106
01:43:12,400 --> 01:43:13,310
你好

107
01:43:23,840 --> 01:43:26,115
-你是豪斯纳的孙子  对吗  -没错
You're hausner's grandson, right? - yeah.

108
01:43:27,520 --> 01:43:28,270
怎么了
And?

109
01:43:29,160 --> 01:43:30,388
你喜欢这里吗
How do you like it here?

110
01:43:34,000 --> 01:43:35,592
这里不是特别有趣  是吗
Not too exciting, is it?

111
01:43:36,680 --> 01:43:38,432
乡村比起城市有点死气沉沉
Pretty dead comared to the city.

112
01:43:38,760 --> 01:43:40,591
不  这挺好的
No, it's fine.

113
01:43:45,720 --> 01:43:46,994
这儿景色不错
Nice spot here.

114
01:44:00,160 --> 01:44:02,549
你就是那个开枪杀人的警察吗
Aren't you the cop who shot that woman?

115
01:44:05,960 --> 01:44:07,075
你怎么知道
How do you know that?

116
01:44:07,280 --> 01:44:08,998
别人都在说
Peole talk.

117
01:44:09,360 --> 01:44:11,191
而且一传十 十传百
And it was in the aper too.

118
01:44:13,960 --> 01:44:14,631
没错
Yes.

119
01:44:16,720 --> 01:44:17,675
我就是
That's me.

120
01:44:20,040 --> 01:44:21,758
那一定很沉痛的经历
Must be a heavy exerience.

121
01:44:25,320 --> 01:44:26,992
我再也不想经历第二次
Wouldn't want to go through it again.

122
01:44:32,560 --> 01:44:35,597
我猜你瞄准的是那个银行劫匪
You aimed at him, the bank robber,

123
01:44:35,960 --> 01:44:37,393
对吗
I guess. am I right?

124
01:44:40,800 --> 01:44:42,313
我瞄准的是汽车轮胎
I aimed at the tires.

125
01:44:46,400 --> 01:44:47,230
打中的却不是
Wanted to.

126
01:44:48,360 --> 01:44:50,954
但我不明白轮胎是很低的
Yeah, but I don't understand. they're much lower.

127
01:44:51,160 --> 01:44:53,913
那时候你肯定瞄得位置太高了
You must have aimed higher for that to happen.

128
01:44:54,120 --> 01:44:56,998
一切发生得太快了
It all went so fast.

129
01:45:00,920 --> 01:45:02,319
我也不清楚那时我怎么想的
I don't understand it myself.

130
01:45:12,360 --> 01:45:14,590
-你会怕那个劫匪吗  -害怕
Aren't you scared of him? - scared?

131
01:45:16,840 --> 01:45:17,990
为什么
Why?

132
01:45:18,680 --> 01:45:20,272
你杀了那个女孩
You killed his girl.

133
01:45:21,200 --> 01:45:24,317
他要是找到你  想开枪杀你呢
What if he tracked you down and wanted to shoot you?

134
01:45:26,160 --> 01:45:27,149
为了复仇
Out of vengeance.

135
01:45:32,600 --> 01:45:33,715
让他来吧
Let him.

136
01:45:40,880 --> 01:45:41,790
随他吧
Let him.

137
01:45:53,280 --> 01:45:54,952
不过我有一点要问他
But there's one thing I'd ask him.

138
01:45:55,200 --> 01:45:56,110
什么
What?

139
01:45:57,280 --> 01:45:59,430
为什么他一开始要带那女孩去
Why he took her along in the first place.

140
01:45:59,880 --> 01:46:02,519
女孩没有开车协助他逃跑
She wasn't driving, wasn't helping him escae.

141
01:46:02,760 --> 01:46:05,194
他一个人进去抢银行  带着女孩没意义
He went into the bank alone. it doesn't make sense.

142
01:46:05,400 --> 01:46:07,436
他为什么要像郊游一样带着她
Why did he take her as if it were an outing?

143
01:46:07,680 --> 01:46:10,717
整件事的发生是因为女孩无故在那里
The whole mess happened because she was there for no reason.

144
01:46:18,560 --> 01:46:19,913
这就是我要问他的
That's what I'd ask him.

145
01:46:24,040 --> 01:46:24,870
再见
Bye.

146
01:47:20,040 --> 01:47:21,109
晚饭好了
Dinner is ready.

147
01:47:29,920 --> 01:47:32,195
这么丰盛  有什么值得庆祝的吗
What's all this? are we celebrating something?

148
01:47:32,400 --> 01:47:33,628
嗯  或许是
Yes, maybe.

149
01:47:34,640 --> 01:47:35,755
我要告诉你一件事
I have to tell you something.

150
01:47:36,760 --> 01:47:39,115
这事还言之过早  我也不是很确定
It's still too early, and I'm not positive,

151
01:47:39,320 --> 01:47:42,392
可我能感觉到
But I have the feeling...

152
01:47:43,080 --> 01:47:44,911
我觉得终于奏效了
I think it finally worked.

153
01:47:45,800 --> 01:47:46,596
什么
What?

154
01:47:47,800 --> 01:47:48,676
你猜猜
Guess.

155
01:47:53,240 --> 01:47:54,514
你真的这么认为吗
What, you really think so?

156
01:47:58,120 --> 01:47:59,872
你怀孕了吗
That you're pregnant?

157
01:48:00,320 --> 01:48:00,957
嗯
Yes.

158
01:48:37,440 --> 01:48:38,190
有人吗
Hello?

159
01:48:40,280 --> 01:48:41,474
有人在吗
Anyone here?

160
01:48:50,400 --> 01:48:51,719
看来这里还有人
Ah, someone's here after all.

161
01:48:52,240 --> 01:48:53,798
豪斯纳在哪  今天是礼拜天
Where is hausner? it's sunday.

162
01:48:54,000 --> 01:48:55,115
在医院
Hosital.

163
01:48:55,640 --> 01:48:56,550
他怎么了
What's wrong with him?

164
01:48:56,800 --> 01:48:58,756
我不知道  还在检查
We don't know. tests.

165
01:48:59,440 --> 01:49:00,429
真可怜
Poor man.

166
01:49:02,320 --> 01:49:03,673
在他们知道前  你要一直在这吗
You're staying till they know?

167
01:49:03,880 --> 01:49:04,949
总有人要留下来
Someone has to.

168
01:49:07,920 --> 01:49:09,990
-我想和你谈谈  -什么
-I wanted to talk to you. - yeah?

169
01:49:13,280 --> 01:49:14,156
进来说
Come in.

170
01:49:19,200 --> 01:49:20,349
说吧
Let's hear it.

171
01:49:25,840 --> 01:49:27,592
你在池塘边碰到了罗伯特
You ran into robert at the pond.

172
01:49:30,800 --> 01:49:32,870
求你不要告诉他我们之间的事
Please never tell him what we did.

173
01:49:33,320 --> 01:49:35,151
-我为什么要那么做  -答应我
Why should i? - promise me.

174
01:49:35,360 --> 01:49:36,270
对天发誓
Swear it.

175
01:49:38,360 --> 01:49:39,429
我发誓
I swear.

176
01:49:47,760 --> 01:49:49,557
我们两个不要再见面了
We shouldn't see each other anymore.

177
01:49:53,320 --> 01:49:54,799
之前的经历让我很愉快
It was great and electrifying,

178
01:49:55,000 --> 01:49:57,150
但我们还是不要再做那种事了
But we shouldn't do it anymore.

179
01:50:06,600 --> 01:50:10,195
-如果只是偶尔遇见那也行  -纯属偶然的话
-I mean if we meet by chance - perfectly normal.

180
01:50:10,800 --> 01:50:12,279
不过我这样最好
But I think it's better this way.

181
01:50:15,880 --> 01:50:16,835
这是谁
Who's that?

182
01:50:18,560 --> 01:50:20,152
我和你说的那个女孩
The girl I told you about.

183
01:50:39,360 --> 01:50:40,713
那个时候你在那儿
Were you there when...

184
01:50:41,400 --> 01:50:42,992
在她死得时候
When she died?

185
01:50:55,680 --> 01:50:56,874
难道是你
That was you?

186
01:51:00,080 --> 01:51:00,956
什么
What?

187
01:51:01,920 --> 01:51:03,717
是你打劫了银行
You robbed the bank?

188
01:51:42,360 --> 01:51:43,713
你现在打算怎么办
What will you do now?

189
01:51:51,200 --> 01:51:53,077
如果他们没抓到我  我就待在这
Stay here if they don't catch me.

1900
1:51:55,400 --> 01:51:56,879
只要他还住在这附近
As long as he's still around.

191
01:52:01,440 --> 01:52:02,634
我必须走了
I have to go now.

192
01:52:16,160 --> 01:52:17,957
不要告诉他我们的事
Please don't tell him what happened.

193
01:52:20,240 --> 01:52:21,389
你不用担心
Don't worry.

194
01:52:34,840 --> 01:52:36,398
我现在真的要走了
I have to go now.
