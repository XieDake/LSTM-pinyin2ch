这是一个平凡小男孩的故事...
This is a story of an ordinary little boy...

11
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:25,090
他名叫查理·巴格特
named Charlie Bucket.

12
00:04:25,770 --> 00:04:30,290
他并不比别的小孩跑得快 也不比他们强壮或是聪明
He was not faster or stronger or more clever than other children.

13
00:04:32,270 --> 00:04:37,070
他家不富有  没背景 也不是什么皇亲国戚
His family was not rich or powerful or well-connected.

14
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:41,040
其实  他们家温饱都成问题
In fact, they barely had enough to eat.

15
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,520
但查理是全世界最幸运的小男孩
Charlie Bucket was the luckiest boy in the entire world.

16
00:04:46,690 --> 00:04:49,050
只是他还不知道而已
He just didn't know it yet.

17
00:05:05,970 --> 00:05:07,630
-大家好  -你好
-Evening, Buckets. -Evening.

18
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:09,270
爸爸
Hi, Dad.

19
00:05:11,380 --> 00:05:13,610
汤快煮好了  老公
Soup's almost ready, darling.

20
00:05:14,220 --> 00:05:17,450
应该没得加菜吧?
Don't suppose there's anything extra to put in, love.

21
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:20,910
算了 甘蓝菜配甘蓝菜最对味了
Oh, well. Nothing goes better with cabbage than cabbage.

22
00:05:25,460 --> 00:05:26,930
查理...
Charlie...

23
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:29,830
我找到一样东西 你应该会喜欢
I found something I think you'll like.

24
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:37,330
查理的父亲在当地牙膏厂上班
Charlie's father worked at the local toothpaste factory.

25
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:41,530
工作时间很长  薪水却少得可怜...
The hours were long, and the pay was terrible...

26
00:05:41,710 --> 00:05:46,540
但偶尔会有意外的惊喜
yet occasionally, there were unexpected surprises.

27
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:50,570
这正是我需要的
It's exactly what I need.

28
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:53,180
那是什么  查理?
What is it, Charlie?

29
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:01,720
爸爸找到了  正好是我需要的
Dad found it, just the piece I needed.

30
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:04,890
-是什么啊?  -威利·旺卡的头
-What piece was it? -A head for Willy Wonka.

31
00:06:05,070 --> 00:06:06,330
太好了
Well, how wonderful.

32
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:08,530
做得很像哦
It's quite a likeness.

33
00:06:08,700 --> 00:06:10,360
-真的吗?  -当然
-You think so? -Think so?

34
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:12,130
我一看就知道了
I know so.

35
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:15,970
我亲眼看过威利·旺卡本人
I saw Willy Wonka with my own two eyes.

36
00:06:16,140 --> 00:06:18,440
-我以前在他的工厂上班 -真的吗?
-I used to work for him, you know. -You did?

37
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:20,140
-真的 -真的
-I did. -He did.

38
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:21,610
真的
He did.

39
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:23,750
我喜欢葡萄
I love grapes.

40
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:28,320
当然  当时的我比现在年轻很多啦
Of course, I was a much younger man in those days.

41
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:32,650
威利·旺卡原本在樱桃街  开了一家小店
Willy Wonka began with a single store on Cherry Street.

42
00:06:32,830 --> 00:06:34,020
(二十年前)

43
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,830
但全世界的人都想吃他的糖果
But the whole world wanted his candy.

44
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:43,530
-旺卡先生  -什么事?
-Mr. Wonka. -Yeah?

45
00:06:43,710 --> 00:06:45,500
旺卡巧克力糖不够卖了...
We need more Wonka bars...

46
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:49,510
-巧克力鸟也没了  -鸟?
and we're out of chocolate birds. -Birds?

47
00:06:49,810 --> 00:06:51,110
鸟
Birds.

48
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,340
好吧  那就多做一点  来
Well, then we'll need to make some more. Here.

49
00:06:58,020 --> 00:06:59,680
嘴巴张开
Now open.

50
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:05,920
那个人是天才
The man was a genius.

51
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:10,760
他发明了一个新方法  做出来的巧克力冰淇淋
Did you know he invented a new way of making chocolate ice cream...

52
00:07:10,940 --> 00:07:14,600
不放冰箱  也能好几个小时不融化
so that it stays cold for hours without a freezer?

53
00:07:14,770 --> 00:07:19,260
甚至放在大热天的太阳底下  也不会融化
You can even leave it lying in the sun on a hot day, and it won't go runny.

54
00:07:20,180 --> 00:07:23,340
-不可能啦  -但威利·旺卡做到了
-But that's impossible. -But Willy Wonka did it.

55
00:07:26,450 --> 00:07:27,640
不久之后...
Before long...

56
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:28,840
(十五年前)

57
00:07:29,020 --> 00:07:31,420
他决定建一座像样的巧克力工厂
he decided to build a proper chocolate factory.

58
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:34,650
有史以来最大的巧克力工厂
The largest chocolate factory in history.

59
00:07:34,830 --> 00:07:38,120
是别的工厂的五十倍大
Fifty times as big as any other.

60
00:07:57,150 --> 00:07:58,810
爷爷  别讲得那么恶啦
Grandpa, don't make it gross.

61
00:07:59,920 --> 00:08:03,720
跟他说那个印度王子的事 他一定会喜欢的
Tell him about the Indian prince. He'd like to hear about that.

62
00:08:04,260 --> 00:08:06,550
你是说本地治里王子吗?
You mean, Prince Pondicherry?

63
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:11,490
本地治里王子 写了一封信给旺卡先生
Well, Prince Pondicherry wrote a letter to Mr. Wonka...

64
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:14,390
请他大老远赶到印度
and asked him to come all the way out to India...

65
00:08:14,830 --> 00:08:19,170
建造一座巨大无比的宫殿 全部都用巧克力做成的
and build him a colossal palace entirely out of chocolate.

66
00:08:22,710 --> 00:08:23,970
(新德里  印度)

67
00:08:24,140 --> 00:08:25,452
要有一百个房间
It will have 100 rooms, 

68
00:08:25,453 --> 00:08:28,640
全是巧克力做的 不管是什么巧克力
and everything will be made of either dark or light chocolate.

69
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,120
他向来是说到做到 砖块是巧克力
True to his word, the bricks were chocolate...

70
00:08:35,290 --> 00:08:38,020
混凝土接合剂也是巧克力
and the cement holding them together was chocolate.

71
00:08:38,760 --> 00:08:42,090
所有墙壁和天花板都是巧克力
All the walls and ceilings were made of chocolate as well.

72
00:08:43,460 --> 00:08:46,830
地毯  墙上的画和家具也是
So were the carpets and the pictures and the furniture.

73
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:49,930
一切都很完美
It is perfect in every way.

74
00:08:50,100 --> 00:08:53,200
对  但持续不了多久 你最好马上开始吃
Yeah, but it won't last long. You better start eating right now.

75
00:08:53,370 --> 00:08:57,170
胡说八道  我才不吃我的宫殿
Oh, nonsense. I will not eat my palace.

76
00:08:57,340 --> 00:09:00,680
我要住在里面
I intend to live in it.

77
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:05,940
当然是被旺卡先生说中了
But Mr. Wonka was right, of course.

78
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:11,750
没过多久  有一天烈日当空  热得要命
Soon after this, there came a very hot day with a boiling sun.

79
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:52,660
王子发了紧急电报 要求重建一座宫殿...
The prince sent an urgent telegram requesting a new palace...

80
00:09:52,870 --> 00:09:55,730
但威利·旺卡自己也遇到了麻烦
but Willy Wonka was facing problems of his own.

81
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:02,540
其他的巧克力制造商  越来越眼红旺卡
All the other chocolate makers, you see, had grown jealous of Mr. Wonka.

82
00:10:02,710 --> 00:10:07,480
他们开始派间谍进工厂 窃取他的秘密配方
They began sending in spies to steal his secret recipes.

83
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:28,500
(秘密配方)

84
00:10:35,310 --> 00:10:39,340
菲克尔格鲁伯开始制造 永不融化的冰淇淋
Fickelgruber started making an ice cream that would never melt.

85
00:10:39,520 --> 00:10:43,920
普罗德诺斯生产了 味道永不变淡的口香糖
Prodnose came out with a chewing gum that never lost its flavor.

86
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:46,850
斯洛格华思也开始做...
Then Slugworth began making candy balloons...

87
00:10:47,020 --> 00:10:50,050
可以吹得好大好大的糖果气球
that you could blow up to incredible sizes.

88
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:53,150
间谍窃取资料的事件频传...
The thievery got so bad...

89
00:10:53,330 --> 00:10:55,490
有一天  在毫无预警的情况下...
that one day, without warning...

90
00:10:55,660 --> 00:11:00,230
旺卡先生请所有工人回家
Mr. Wonka told every single one of his workers to go home.

91
00:11:00,400 --> 00:11:05,200
他宣布要永远关闭巧克力工厂
He announced that he was closing his chocolate factory forever.

92
00:11:05,370 --> 00:11:09,610
我要永远关闭巧克力工厂了
I'm closing my chocolate factory forever.

93
00:11:09,780 --> 00:11:11,040
对不起
I'm sorry.

94
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:30,790
可是没有永远关闭  现在又开工了啊
But it didn't close forever. It's open right now.

95
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:35,200
恩  有时候大人说的永远 只是指很长一段时间
Yes, well, sometimes when grownups say"forever," they mean"a very long time."

96
00:11:35,940 --> 00:11:39,100
比如  我好像永远都在吃甘蓝菜汤
Such as,"I feel like I've eaten nothing but cabbage soup forever."

97
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,930
-岳父  别闹了 -工厂确实关闭了  查理
-Now, Pops. -The factory did close, Charlie.

98
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:47,070
大家都以为真的会永远关闭
And it seemed like it was going to be closed forever.

99
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:51,910
结果有一天 我们看到烟囱又冒出烟来了
Then one day we saw smoke rising from the chimneys.

100
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:55,990
-工厂又恢复运作了 -你又回去上班了吗?
-The factory was back in business. -Did you get your job back?

101
00:11:56,830 --> 00:11:58,260
没有
No.

102
00:11:58,430 --> 00:12:00,260
谁也没有回去上班
No one did.

103
00:12:03,730 --> 00:12:05,560
可是一定有人在里面工作
But there must be people working there.

104
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:09,270
查理  你回想一下  有没有看到任何人...
Think about it, Charlie. Have you ever seen a single person...

105
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:12,140
进入工厂或从工厂出来?
going into that factory or coming out of it?

106
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:16,510
没有  一直是大门深锁
No. The gates are always closed.

107
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:18,340
那就对了
Exactly.

108
00:12:18,920 --> 00:12:21,010
到底是谁在操作机器呢?
But then, who's running the machines?

109
00:12:21,190 --> 00:12:24,150
-没人知道  -这是一个谜
-Nobody knows, Charlie. -It certainly is a mystery.

110
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:26,650
没人问过旺卡先生吗?
Hasn't someone asked Mr. Wonka?

111
00:12:27,690 --> 00:12:31,350
没人再见过他了  他也没再出来过
Nobody sees him anymore. He never comes out.

112
00:12:32,130 --> 00:12:36,430
唯一从工厂出来的就只有糖果...
The only thing that comes out of that place is the candy...

113
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,130
都已经包装封箱分配好了
already packed and addressed.

114
00:12:39,770 --> 00:12:44,730
我愿不惜任何代价再进工厂一次...
I'd give anything in the world just to go in one more time...

115
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:49,010
看看那间不可思议的工厂 现在变成怎样了
and see what's become of that amazing factory.

116
00:12:49,980 --> 00:12:53,540
不可能的  因为你进不去  没人进的去
Well, you won't, because you can't. No one can.

117
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:57,680
这是一个谜  永远都是一个谜
It's a mystery, and it will always be a mystery.

118
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:02,620
你那个模型小工厂 是我们唯一能靠近的工厂
That little factory of yours, Charlie, is as close as any of us is ever going to get.

119
00:13:04,330 --> 00:13:08,030
走吧  查理 老人家们该睡觉了
Come on, Charlie. I think it's time we let your grandparents get some sleep.

120
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:13,270
-晚安  乔治公公  -晚安  查理
-Good night, Grandpa George. -Night, Charlie.

121

-晚安  -椅子
-Night-night. -Chair.

122
00:13:15,710 --> 00:13:17,570

Thank you, dear.

123
00:13:19,210 --> 00:13:20,970
晚安  约瑟夫爷爷
Night, Grandpa Joe.

124
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:24,680
晚安  乔治娜婆婆
Good night, Grandma Georgina.

125
00:13:24,850 --> 00:13:28,050
世上没有不可能的事  查理
Nothing's impossible, Charlie.

126
00:13:45,110 --> 00:13:47,500
-晚安  -晚安  查理
-Good night. -Night, Charlie.

127
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:49,270
祝你好梦
Sleep well.

128
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:05,590
其实那天晚上 不可能的事就已经开始发生了
Indeed, that very night, the impossible had already been set in motion.

129
00:15:06,120 --> 00:15:08,250
亲爱的世人...
Dear people of the world...

130
00:15:08,620 --> 00:15:10,180

I, Willy Wonka...

131
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:14,960
决定让五个小朋友  来参观我的工厂

132
00:15:15,130 --> 00:15:18,790
另外  其中一个小朋友 还可以赢得大奖...
In addition, one of these children shall receive a special prize...

133
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:22,560
超乎任何人想像的大奖
beyond anything you could ever imagine.

134
00:15:23,140 --> 00:15:24,970
有五张金奖券...
Five golden tickets have been hidden...

135
00:15:25,140 --> 00:15:28,470
藏在五块普通装旺卡巧克力  不起眼的包装纸里
underneath the ordinary wrapping paper of five ordinary Wonka bars.

136
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:30,210
这五块巧克力可能在任何地方...
The bars may be anywhere...

137
00:15:30,380 --> 00:15:31,400
(东京  日本)

138
00:15:31,580 --> 00:15:36,780
在任何一个国家的任何城市 任何街道的任何一家商店里
in any shop, in any street, in any town, in any country in the world.

139
00:15:44,090 --> 00:15:45,990
(马拉喀什  摩洛哥)

140
00:15:58,610 --> 00:16:00,540
(纽约)

141
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:14,750
查理  很令人兴奋吧 拆开巧克力糖的包装纸...
Wouldn't it be something, Charlie, to open a bar of candy...

142
00:16:14,930 --> 00:16:17,320
发现里面有张金奖券
and find a golden ticket inside?

143
00:16:17,660 --> 00:16:22,260
是啊  但我一年只有一块巧克力糖 是生日礼物
I know, but I only get one bar a year, for my birthday.

144
00:16:22,430 --> 00:16:24,020
你生日下礼拜就到了啊
Well, it's your birthday next week.

145
00:16:24,640 --> 00:16:27,660
你和任何人的机会一样多
You have as much chance as anybody does.

146
00:16:27,840 --> 00:16:30,770
胡说八道 找得到金奖券的小孩...
Balderdash. The kids who are going to find the golden tickets...

147
00:16:30,940 --> 00:16:33,710
一定是每天都买巧克力来吃的小孩
are the ones who can afford to buy candy bars every day.

148
00:16:33,880 --> 00:16:37,970
咱们查理一年只有一块  他没机会的拉
Our Charlie gets only one a year. He doesn't have a chance.

149
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:40,780
查理  每个人都有机会
Everyone has a chance, Charlie.

150
00:16:41,190 --> 00:16:44,920
我说的准没错 找到第一张金奖券的小孩...
Mark my words, the kid who finds the first ticket...

151
00:16:45,090 --> 00:16:47,680
一定是个超级大胖子
will be fat, fat, fat.

152
00:16:47,960 --> 00:16:49,860
奥古塔斯  看这边
Augustus. This way.

153
00:16:52,700 --> 00:16:54,660
(杜塞道夫  德国)

154
00:16:54,830 --> 00:16:56,800
我在吃旺卡巧克力的时候...
I am eating the Wonka bar...

155
00:16:56,970 --> 00:17:00,270
突然吃到不是巧克力的东西...
and I taste something that is not chocolate...

156
00:17:01,170 --> 00:17:03,040
也不是椰果...
or coconut...

157
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:05,940
也不是胡桃  也不是花生酱...
or walnut or peanut butter...

158
00:17:06,440 --> 00:17:08,340
也不是牛轧糖...
or nougat...

159
00:17:08,750 --> 00:17:13,240
也不是脆果糖或焦糖  也不是巧克力糖霜
or butter brittle or caramel or sprinkles.

160
00:17:14,690 --> 00:17:16,480
于是我看了一眼...
So I look...

161
00:17:17,890 --> 00:17:19,410
就发现金奖券了
and I find the golden ticket.

162
00:17:19,590 --> 00:17:21,790
奥古塔斯  你怎么庆祝的?
Augustus, how did you celebrate?

163
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:24,690
我又吃更多的糖果
I eat more candy.

164
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:30,800
我们早就知道 奥古塔斯会找到金奖券
We knew Augustus would find the golden ticket.

165
00:17:31,470 --> 00:17:33,700
他每天都吃好多糖果...
He eats so many candy bars a day...

166
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:37,640
不可能连一张金奖券都找不到
that it was not possible for him not to find one.

167
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:40,970
很不错  奥古塔斯
Yes, it is good, Augustus.

168
00:17:41,680 --> 00:17:43,670
出现第一张金奖券  还剩下四张...
Golden ticket claimed and four more...

169
00:17:43,850 --> 00:17:45,150
我就说是个大胖子嘛
Told you it'd be a porker.

170
00:17:45,550 --> 00:17:47,420
真讨人厌的小孩
What a repulsive boy.

171
00:17:47,850 --> 00:17:49,480
只剩下四张金奖券了
Only four golden tickets left.

172
00:17:49,690 --> 00:17:54,320
既然有人找到一张  大家一定会越来越疯狂
Now that they've found one, things will really get crazy.

173
00:17:54,490 --> 00:17:56,480
每种形状  大小  及色彩
Of every shape, size and hue.

174
00:17:57,730 --> 00:17:59,590
(英国白金汉郡)

175
00:18:00,430 --> 00:18:03,060
维露卡  麻烦你拼一下  好吗
Veruca. Can you spell that for us, please?

维-露-卡 维露卡·索尔特
V-E-R-U-C-A. Veruca Salt.

177
00:18:08,310 --> 00:18:12,110
我的小维露卡一说她想要金奖券...
As soon as my little Veruca told me she had to have one of these golden tickets...

178
00:18:12,450 --> 00:18:15,380
我就把买得到的旺卡巧克力 全都买下来
I started buying all the Wonka bars I could lay my hands on.

179
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:18,380
成千上万块  数以百计
Thousands of them. Hundreds of thousands.

180
00:18:19,150 --> 00:18:22,950
我是从事坚果业 所以我就告诉工人们
I'm in the nut business, you see. So I say to my workers:

181
00:18:23,560 --> 00:18:26,580
各位女士早安 从现在起暂停剥花生壳...
Morning, ladies. From now on, you can stop shelling peanuts...

182
00:18:26,760 --> 00:18:29,890
改拆这些巧克力的包装纸
and start shelling the wrappers off these chocolate bars instead.

183
00:18:44,450 --> 00:18:47,440
过了三天  还是没找到 真是太糟糕了
Three days went by, and we had no luck.  Oh, it was terrible.

184
00:18:47,950 --> 00:18:50,070
我的小维露卡一天比一天生气
My Veruca got more and more upset each day.

185
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:51,720
我的金奖券呢?
Where's my golden ticket?

186
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:54,180
我要我的金奖券
I want my golden ticket.

187
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:59,350
各位  我最讨厌看到我的宝贝女儿不开心
Well, gentlemen, I just hated to see my little girl feeling unhappy like that.

188
00:18:59,890 --> 00:19:03,090
我发誓不找到金奖券绝不罢休
I vowed I would keep searching until I could give her what she wanted.

189
00:19:04,570 --> 00:19:07,900
结果终于让我找到了一张
And finally, I found her a ticket.

190

(索尔特坚果公司)

191
00:19:34,430 --> 00:19:37,690
爸爸  我还要一匹小马
Daddy, I want another pony.

192
00:19:39,630 --> 00:19:41,620
她比那个胖小子更讨人厌
She's even worse than the fat boy.

193
00:19:42,170 --> 00:19:45,760
我觉得不太公平 她不是自己发现金奖券的
I don't think that was really fair. She didn't find the ticket herself.

194
00:19:46,110 --> 00:19:50,370
别担心  查理  那人把她女儿宠坏了
Don't worry about it, Charlie. That man spoils his daughter.

195
00:19:50,810 --> 00:19:54,650
像那样宠坏小孩 是不会有好下场的
And no good ever comes from spoiling a child like that.

196
00:19:59,890 --> 00:20:03,190
查理  我和你妈希望你...
Charlie, Mum and I thought...

197
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:06,230
今晚就拆生日礼物
maybe you wanna open your birthday present tonight.

198
00:20:12,740 --> 00:20:14,130
拿去吧
Here you are.

(一流开心牛奶巧克力软糖)

200
00:20:26,580 --> 00:20:28,110
我等明天早上再拆好了
Maybe I should wait till morning.

201

-门儿都没有  -岳父
-Like hell. -Pop.

202

我们加起来381岁了  别想叫我们等
All together, we're 381 years old. We don't wait.

203
00:20:44,170 --> 00:20:46,860
查理  就算没找到...
Now, Charlie, you mustn't feel too disappointed...

204
00:20:47,040 --> 00:20:49,030
也不要觉得太失望...
you know, if you don't get the...

205
00:20:49,210 --> 00:20:51,300
无论如何  你还有巧克力吃
Whatever happens, you'll still have the candy.

206
00:21:20,840 --> 00:21:22,500
好了
Ah, well.

207
00:21:22,970 --> 00:21:24,700
没戏唱了
That's that.

208
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:29,170
-我们分着吃吧  -不行
-We'll share it. -Oh, no, Charlie.

209
00:21:29,350 --> 00:21:30,970
这是你的生日礼物
Not your birthday present.

210
00:21:31,850 --> 00:21:35,220
这是我的巧克力 我想给谁吃就给谁吃
It's my candy bar, and I'll do what I want with it.

211
00:21:41,890 --> 00:21:43,380
谢谢你
Thank you, darling.

212
00:21:44,330 --> 00:21:45,920
谢谢你
Thank you, Charlie.

213
00:21:50,370 --> 00:21:51,730
愿神佑你
Bless you.

214
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:19,820
好  看看是谁找到的
All right, let's see who found it.

215
00:22:24,440 --> 00:22:27,730
第三张金奖券的得主 是紫罗兰·博雷加德小姐
"The third ticket was found by Miss Violet Beauregarde."

216
00:22:42,720 --> 00:22:45,990
(乔治亚州  亚特兰大市)

217
00:22:46,160 --> 00:22:52,060
这些只是我的紫罗兰 赢得的263座奖杯的一部分
These are just some of the 263 trophies and medals my Violet has won.

218
00:22:52,230 --> 00:22:55,670
我平常喜欢嚼口香糖 但我一听到金奖券的事...
I'm a gum chewer mostly, but when I heard about these ticket things...

219
00:22:55,840 --> 00:22:58,030
就暂时不买口香糖  改买巧克力
I laid off the gum, switched to candy bars.

220
00:22:58,470 --> 00:23:01,410
她是个冲劲十足的小女孩 不知道是遗传谁的
She's just a driven young woman. I don't know where she gets it.

221
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:06,140
我是嚼口香糖的世界冠军
I'm the Junior World Champion Gum Chewer.

222
00:23:06,310 --> 00:23:08,300
我嘴里嚼的这片口香糖...
This piece of gum I'm chewing right now...

223
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:12,380
已经整整嚼了三个月 刷新了世界纪录
I've been working on for three months solid. That's a record.

224
00:23:12,550 --> 00:23:16,990
当然  我也有不少战利品 多半是甩指挥棒得来的
Of course, I did have my share of trophies, mostly baton.

225
00:23:17,390 --> 00:23:21,590
上面写着有个小朋友能得到大奖 别的小朋友都得不到
So it says that one kid's gonna get this special prize, better than all the rest.

226
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:25,960
我才不管其他四个人是谁 得大奖的小孩一定是我
I don't care who those other four are. That kid, it's gonna be me.

227
00:23:26,300 --> 00:23:27,600
告诉他们为什么  紫罗兰
Tell them why, Violet.

228
00:23:28,040 --> 00:23:29,370
因为我天生是赢家
Because I'm a winner.

229
00:23:29,900 --> 00:23:31,670
真讨人厌的女孩
What a beastly girl.

230
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,930
卑鄙下流
Despicable.

231
00:23:34,110 --> 00:23:36,340
你知不知道我们在说啥
You don't know what we're talking about.

232
00:23:38,250 --> 00:23:39,970
蜻蜓吗?
Dragonflies?

233
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:41,840
等一下  有最新消息
But wait, this is just in.

234
00:23:42,020 --> 00:23:47,480
第四张金奖券找到了 是一名叫麦克·蒂维的男孩
The fourth golden ticket has been found by a boy called Mike Teavee.

235
00:23:50,230 --> 00:23:52,590
(科罗拉多州  丹佛市)

236
00:23:59,470 --> 00:24:02,260
只要从制造日期来推算就好了...
All you had to do was track the manufacturing dates...

237
00:24:02,440 --> 00:24:05,870
再加上天气的影响 还有日经指数的导数值
offset by weather and the derivative of the Nikkei Index.

238
00:24:06,310 --> 00:24:08,140
就连智障都算得出来
A retard could figure it out.

239
00:24:09,350 --> 00:24:12,010
我经常听不懂他在讲什么
Most of the time I don't know what he's talking about.

240
00:24:12,180 --> 00:24:15,120
这年头的小孩知道太多高科技了...
You know, kids these days, what with all the technology...

241
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:17,550
去死!  去死!
Die! Die! Die!

242
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,550
他们的童年应该不会太长
Doesn't seem like they stay kids very long.

243
00:24:26,630 --> 00:24:29,030
我只要买一块巧克力就够了
In the end, I only had to buy one candy bar.

244
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:32,200
-好不好吃?  -不知道
-And how did it taste? -I don't know.

245
00:24:32,370 --> 00:24:33,770
我讨厌巧克力
I hate chocolate.

246
00:24:33,940 --> 00:24:37,870
那你干嘛要去巧克力工厂? 你这个忘恩负义的...
Well, it's a good thing you're going to a chocolate factory, you ungrateful little...

247
00:24:48,220 --> 00:24:51,710
问题是 谁会找到最后一张金奖...
That question is, who will be the winner of the last gold...?

248
00:24:58,130 --> 00:24:59,750
-爸爸?  -什么事?
-Dad? -Yes, Charlie?

249
00:25:00,160 --> 00:25:01,990
你怎么没去上班?
Why aren't you at work?

250
00:25:03,170 --> 00:25:07,030
牙膏工厂希望我能休息一阵子
Oh, well, the toothpaste factory thought they'd give me a bit of time off.

251
00:25:07,770 --> 00:25:09,100
像暑假一样?
Like summer vacation?

252
00:25:09,810 --> 00:25:12,140
对  就是那样
Sure. Something like that.

253
00:25:15,540 --> 00:25:19,480
其实他根本不是放什么假
In fact, it wasn't like a vacation at all.

254
00:25:20,520 --> 00:25:24,780
糖果卖得好 结果蛀牙的人就变多了...
The upswing in candy sales had led to a rise in cavities...

255
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:27,980
牙膏的销售量也随之提升
which led to a rise in toothpaste sales.

256
00:25:32,660 --> 00:25:36,430
工厂赚了大钱 就决定要现代化...
With the extra money, the factory had decided to modernize...

257
00:25:37,030 --> 00:25:40,560
结果巴格特先生失业了
eliminating Mr. Bucket's job.

258
00:25:45,840 --> 00:25:48,440
我们原本就已经三餐不继
We were barely making ends meet as it was.

259
00:25:48,610 --> 00:25:50,670
你会找到新工作的
You'll find another job.

260
00:25:50,850 --> 00:25:55,010
在此之前我就...我就把汤稀释一点
Until then, I'll just...Well, I'll just thin down the soup a little more.

261
00:25:56,450 --> 00:26:00,450
放心吧  巴格特先生 我们会转运的
Don't worry, Mr. Bucket, our luck will change.

262
00:26:00,830 --> 00:26:02,420
我有信心
I know it.

263
00:26:06,130 --> 00:26:07,620
查理
Charlie.

264
00:26:23,980 --> 00:26:26,140
我的私房钱
My secret hoard.

265
00:26:29,150 --> 00:26:33,020
咱们爷俩再试一次手气  看看...
You and I are going to have one more fling...

266
00:26:33,190 --> 00:26:35,460
能不能找到最后一张金奖券
at finding that last ticket.

267
00:26:36,260 --> 00:26:38,460
你确定要把钱花在这上面?
You sure you want to spend your money on that?

268
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:41,360
我当然确定  拿去吧
Of course I'm sure. Here.

269
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:45,100
跑去最近的商店...
Run down to the nearest store...

270
00:26:45,270 --> 00:26:49,100
看到第一块旺卡巧克力就买下来
and buy the first Wonka candy bar you see.

271
00:26:49,270 --> 00:26:52,800
直接拿回家 我们一起拆包装纸
Bring it straight back, and we'll open it together.

272
00:27:01,190 --> 00:27:03,920
真是个乖孩子
Such a good boy, really.

273
00:27:05,160 --> 00:27:06,350
真是个乖...
Such a good...

274
00:27:08,930 --> 00:27:10,360
爷爷?
Grandpa?

275
00:27:11,430 --> 00:27:13,900
-你睡着了  -你买到了吗?
-You fell asleep. -Have you got it?

276
00:27:19,370 --> 00:27:21,360
要从哪一端开始拆?
Which end should we open first?

277
00:27:21,770 --> 00:27:24,240
速战速决  像撕OK绷一样
Just do it quick, like a Band-Aid.

278
00:27:54,580 --> 00:27:57,600
你知不知道有个俄国小孩 找到最后一张金奖券了?
Did you see that some kid in Russia found the last golden ticket?

279
00:27:57,780 --> 00:27:59,840
对  今天的早报有登
Yes, it was in the paper this morning.

280
00:28:00,010 --> 00:28:03,510
乖狗狗 来吧  乔治  乖狗狗
Good boy. Come on, George. Good boy.

281
00:28:56,010 --> 00:28:58,670
请给我一块旺卡一流开心牛奶巧克力软糖
One Wonka Whipple-Scrumptious Fudgemallow Delight, please.

282
00:28:58,840 --> 00:29:01,330
好的  拿去吧
Okay. Here you go.

283
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:06,810
(俄国的金奖券是假的 还剩一张金奖券)

284
00:29:06,980 --> 00:29:08,710
那些人真胆大
The nerve of some people.

285
00:29:09,320 --> 00:29:12,620
对啊 仿造金奖券?  别傻了
I know. Forging a ticket. Come on.

286
00:29:25,400 --> 00:29:27,630
那是金奖券耶
It's a golden ticket.

287
00:29:29,410 --> 00:29:32,970
你找到旺卡的最后一张金奖券
You found Wonka's last golden ticket.

288
00:29:33,580 --> 00:29:35,640
而且是在我店里买的
In my shop too!

289
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:40,210

你疯了吗?  我出五百元买你的金奖券
Are you crazy? I'd give him $500 for that ticket.

291
00:29:43,650 --> 00:29:46,180
五百元把金奖券卖给我吧
You wanna sell me your ticket for $500, young man?

292
00:29:46,360 --> 00:29:48,650
够了  别烦这位小朋友
That's enough of that. Leave the kid alone.

293
00:29:49,290 --> 00:29:54,390
听着  千万不要给任何人 直接拿着回家  懂吗?
Listen. Don't let anyone have it. Take it straight home, you understand?

294
00:29:55,900 --> 00:29:57,200
谢谢你
Thank you.

295
00:30:04,510 --> 00:30:06,670
妈!  爸!
Mom! Dad!

296
00:30:07,540 --> 00:30:09,700

拿去
Here.

299
00:30:36,910 --> 00:30:40,040
大声念出来  看看上面写什么
Read it aloud. Let's hear exactly what it says.

300
00:30:41,050 --> 00:30:46,010
欢迎你  找到金奖券的幸运儿 威利·旺卡先生祝福你
"Greetings to you, the lucky finder of this golden ticket, from Mr. Willy Wonka.

I shake you warmly by the hand. For now, I do invite you to come to my factory...

我  威利·旺卡 将亲自带你们参观工厂...
"I, Willy Wonka, will conduct you around the factory myself...

304
00:30:57,630 --> 00:30:59,650
带你们看遍每个细节
showing you everything there is to see."

305
00:30:59,830 --> 00:31:01,760
等到参观完毕要离开时...
"Afterwards, when it is time to leave...

306
00:31:01,930 --> 00:31:05,330
你可以载走满满好几卡车...
you will be escorted home by a procession of large trucks...

307
00:31:05,500 --> 00:31:08,800
足够让你吃一辈子的巧克力
each one filled with all the chocolate you could ever eat."

308
00:31:08,970 --> 00:31:13,670
记住  五个小朋友当中 有一位将独得大奖...
"And remember, one of you lucky five children will receive an extra prize...

309
00:31:13,850 --> 00:31:16,040
超乎你最疯狂的想像之外
beyond your wildest imagination.

310
00:31:16,220 --> 00:31:18,580
请遵照以下的指示
Now, here are your instructions."

311
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:22,690
请在二月一日 上午十点整到工厂门口
"On the 1st of February, you must come to the factory gates at 10 a.m. Sharp.

312
00:31:22,860 --> 00:31:26,220
你可以带一位家人随行照顾
You're allowed to bring one member of your family to look after you.

313
00:31:26,390 --> 00:31:28,660
到时候见了 威利·旺卡
Until then, Willy Wonka."

314
00:31:29,330 --> 00:31:30,660
二月一日
The 1st of February.

315
00:31:31,730 --> 00:31:34,600
-就是明天耶 -那片刻不容缓了  查理
-But that's tomorrow. -Then there's not a moment to lose.

316
00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:38,600
快去洗脸...梳头...洗手...刷牙...清鼻子
Wash your face, comb your hair, scrub your hands, brush your teeth, blow your nose.

317
00:31:38,770 --> 00:31:42,260
-还要换掉那条脏裤子 -我们现在要保持冷静
-And get that mud off your pants. -Now we must all try and keep very calm.

318
00:31:42,810 --> 00:31:44,752
首先要决定的是 
First thing that we have to decide is this:

319
00:31:44,753 --> 00:31:47,180
谁来陪查理去参观工厂
 Who is going with Charlie to the factory?

320
00:31:47,450 --> 00:31:50,570
我去  我带他去 交给我就对了
I will. I'll take him. You leave it to me.

321
00:31:50,950 --> 00:31:53,440
怎样?  你不觉得你应该去吗?
How about you, dear? Don't you think you ought to go?

322
00:31:53,820 --> 00:31:58,190
约瑟夫爷爷好像比我们任何人  知道得多...
Well, Grandpa Joe seems to know more about it than we do, and...

323
00:31:59,130 --> 00:32:01,180
当然前提是他身体负荷得了
Provided, of course, he feels well enough.

324
00:32:04,600 --> 00:32:07,160
不行  我们不去了
No. We're not going.

325
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:13,770
有个阿姨要花五百元买金奖券
A woman offered me $500 for the ticket.

326
00:32:13,940 --> 00:32:16,140
一定还有人出价更高
I bet someone else would pay more.

327
00:32:16,310 --> 00:32:18,570
我们需要的是钱  不是巧克力
We need the money more than we need the chocolate.

328
00:32:28,660 --> 00:32:31,020
小伙子  过来
Young man, come here.

329
00:32:34,860 --> 00:32:37,560
外头的钱多得是
There's plenty of money out there.

330
00:32:37,730 --> 00:32:39,820
每天都有新钞在印
They print more every day.

331
00:32:40,800 --> 00:32:42,740
但这张金奖券...
But this ticket...

332
00:32:42,900 --> 00:32:46,810
全世界只有五张而已...
there's only five of them in the whole world...

333
00:32:46,980 --> 00:32:49,310
以后也不会再有了
and that's all there's ever going to be.

334
00:32:50,140 --> 00:32:55,210
只有傻瓜才会放弃金奖券 要钱那种俗气的东西
Only a dummy would give this up for something as common as money.

335
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:57,980
你是傻瓜吗?
Are you a dummy?

336
00:32:58,890 --> 00:33:00,220
不是
No, sir.

337
00:33:00,920 --> 00:33:04,860
那就去换掉那条脏裤子 你要去参观工厂了
Then get that mud off your pants. You've got a factory to go to.

338
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:51,270
爸爸  我要进去
Daddy, I want to go in.

339
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:52,960
才9点59分  甜心
It's 9:59, sweetheart.

340
00:33:53,140 --> 00:33:55,670
叫时间过快一点啦
Make time go faster.

341
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:58,050
你觉得旺卡先生会认出你吗?
Do you think Mr. Wonka will recognize you?

342
00:33:58,210 --> 00:34:02,170
很难说  事隔多年了
Hard to say. It's been years.

343
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:11,320
专心得大奖  紫罗兰
Eyes on the prize, Violet.

344
00:34:11,490 --> 00:34:13,760

根本不可能掩饰
There is no way to contain it!

360
00:35:38,750 --> 00:35:42,120
掩饰...
To contain it To contain, to contain, to contain!

361
00:35:42,550 --> 00:35:44,110
万岁!
Hooray!

362

367
00:35:54,970 --> 00:35:56,630
有史以来最了不起的人

很精彩吧?
Wasn't that just magnificent?

371
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,999
我本来还担心中间会有点怪 
I was worried it was getting a little dodgy in the middle part, 

372
00:36:39,000 --> 00:36:40,910
可是那个结尾...
but then that finale...

373
00:36:45,290 --> 00:36:47,080

374

380
00:37:27,260 --> 00:37:28,960
那你不是应该在那上面吗?
Then shouldn't you be up there?

381
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:33,460
坐在上面就看不到表演了 对吧  小女孩?
I couldn't very well watch the show from up there, now, could I, little girl?

382
00:37:33,630 --> 00:37:37,470
旺卡先生  不知道你记不记得我...
Mr. Wonka, I don't know if you'll remember me...

383
00:37:37,640 --> 00:37:40,500
我以前在贵工厂上班
but I used to work here in the factory.

384
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:44,030
你是爱剽窃别人的糖果商 雇来的间谍...
Were you one of those despicable spies who tried to steal...

385
00:37:44,210 --> 00:37:48,080
偷走我毕生的心血 卖给人家的人吗?
my life's work and sell it to parasitic, copycat, candy-making cads?

386
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:49,580
不是
No, sir.

387
00:37:50,250 --> 00:37:51,810

390
00:37:58,990 --> 00:38:03,690
我觉得没必要耶 快走吧  有太多东西要看了
Can't imagine how it would matter. Come quickly. Far too much to see.

391
00:38:09,410 --> 00:38:11,240
外套随便丢就行了
Just drop your coats anywhere.

392
00:38:17,380 --> 00:38:20,750
-旺卡先生  室内很热耶 -什么?
-Mr. Wonka? Sure is toasty in here. -What?

393
00:38:21,350 --> 00:38:26,010
室内要保持温暖 因为我的员工都习惯热带气候
I have to keep it warm in here. My workers are used to an extremely hot climate.

394
00:38:26,190 --> 00:38:28,380
他们受不了寒冷
They just can't stand the cold.

395
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:29,790
什么员工?
Who are the workers?

396
00:38:30,360 --> 00:38:32,190
待会儿就知道了  现在...
All in good time. Now...

00:38:36,730 --> 00:38:38,600
旺卡先生  我是紫罗兰·博雷加德

398
00:38:41,540 --> 00:38:43,560
-我才不在乎 -你应该要在乎
-I don't care. -Well, you should care.

399
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:46,210
因为赢得大奖的人会是我
Because I'm gonna win the special prize at the end.

400
00:38:46,380 --> 00:38:49,310
你看起来很有自信  自信很重要
Well, you do seem confident, and confidence is key.

401
00:38:52,350 --> 00:38:55,440
我是维露卡·索尔特  幸会
I'm Veruca Salt. It's very nice to meet you, sir.

402
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:58,280
我以为维露卡...
I always thought a verruca was a type of wart...

403
00:38:58,460 --> 00:39:01,010
是脚底长的一种疣
you got on the bottom of your foot.

404
00:39:02,460 --> 00:39:05,390
我是奥古塔斯·格卢普 我很爱吃你的巧克力

405
00:39:06,630 --> 00:39:09,290

406
00:39:09,470 --> 00:39:12,560
没想到我们有这么多共同点
I never expected to have so much in common.

407
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:19,400
你是麦克·蒂维
You. You're Mike Teavee.

408
00:39:19,940 --> 00:39:22,100
那个坏了我好事的小魔鬼
You're the little devil who cracked the system.

409
00:39:24,350 --> 00:39:27,280
还有你 你纯粹是运气好吧
And you. Well, you're just lucky to be here, aren't you?

410
00:39:29,420 --> 00:39:31,940
其他几位想必是他们的...
And the rest of you must be their...

411
00:39:39,430 --> 00:39:41,860

420
00:40:41,690 --> 00:40:45,550
-毕竟这是巧克力工厂 -为什么门这么小?
-After all, it is a chocolate factory. -Then why is the door so small?

421
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:49,660
这样浓郁的巧克力香味 才不会散出去啊
That's to keep all the great big chocolaty flavor inside.

433
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:13,470
搅拌均匀 让巧克力滑溜又顺口
Churns it up. Makes it light and frothy.

434
00:42:14,050 --> 00:42:15,280
对了...
By the way...

435
00:42:15,450 --> 00:42:21,220
全世界没有别的工厂  用瀑布来混合巧克力
no other factory in the world mixes its chocolate by waterfall, my dear children.

436
00:42:21,390 --> 00:42:23,250
这点我可以向你们保证
And you can take that to the bank.

437
00:42:33,640 --> 00:42:35,230
各位
People.

438
00:42:37,410 --> 00:42:39,340
那些管子...
Those pipes...

439
00:42:39,840 --> 00:42:44,440
会吸取巧克力 输送到工厂内的各个角落
suck up the chocolate and carry it away all over the factory.

440
00:42:45,150 --> 00:42:47,840
每小时好几千加仑 没错
Thousands of gallons an hour. Yeah.

441
00:42:49,250 --> 00:42:52,150
喜欢这片草地吗?  抓一把来吃
And do you like my meadow? Try some of my grass.

442
00:42:52,320 --> 00:42:56,880
你们就吃一点吧 这是又好吃又好看
Please have a blade. Please do. It's so delectable and so darn good-looking.

443
00:42:57,560 --> 00:42:59,030
草也可以吃?
You can eat the grass?

444
00:42:59,200 --> 00:43:01,250
当然
Of course you can.

445
00:43:01,430 --> 00:43:03,660
这个房间里的每样东西都能吃
Everything in this room is eatable.

446
00:43:03,830 --> 00:43:05,200
就连我也可以吃
Even I'm eatable.

447
00:43:05,370 --> 00:43:08,170
不过我们不是食人族啦...
But that is called cannibalism, my dear children...

448
00:43:08,340 --> 00:43:11,170
文明社会是不容许人吃人的
and is, in fact, frowned upon in most societies.

449
00:43:11,440 --> 00:43:12,670
是啊
Yeah.

450
00:43:13,710 --> 00:43:15,270
尽情享用吧
Enjoy.

451
00:43:15,950 --> 00:43:18,170
去啊 快去啊
Go on. Scoot, scoot.

452
00:43:39,470 --> 00:43:40,940
儿子
Son.

453
00:43:42,340 --> 00:43:43,570
拜托别闹了
Please.

454
00:43:44,670 --> 00:43:47,370
爸  他说"尽情"耶
Dad, he said, "Enjoy."

455
00:44:01,290 --> 00:44:04,280
何必这么坚持?  干嘛不换片新的?
Why hold on to it? Why not start a new piece?

456
00:44:05,060 --> 00:44:09,560
换了  我就不是冠军 而是个失败者  像你一样
Because then I wouldn't be a champion. I'd be a loser, like you.

457
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:40,220
爸爸  看那边
Daddy, look over there.

458
00:44:41,900 --> 00:44:43,590
那是什么?
What is it?

459
00:44:43,770 --> 00:44:45,330
是一个小矮人
It's a little person.

460
00:44:45,500 --> 00:44:47,970
在那里  瀑布旁边
Over there, by the waterfall.

461
00:44:50,140 --> 00:44:52,770
-有两个耶  -不只两个
-There's two of them. -There's more than two.

462
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:01,740
-他们从哪儿来的?  -他们是谁?
-Where do they come from? -Who are they?

463
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:05,350
他们是真人吗?
Are they real people?

464
00:45:05,530 --> 00:45:07,960
他们当然是真人 他们是奥柏伦柏人
Of course they're real people. They're Oompa-Loompas.

465
00:45:11,700 --> 00:45:14,670
-奥柏伦柏人?  -直接从伦柏地进口的
-Oompa-Loompas? -Imported, direct from Loompaland.

466
00:45:14,830 --> 00:45:17,430
-没这个地方  -什么?
-There's no such place. -What?

467
00:45:17,600 --> 00:45:21,090
旺卡先生  我教高中地理  我跟你说...
Mr. Wonka, I teach high-school geography, and I'm here to tell you...

468
00:45:21,270 --> 00:45:26,440
那你应该清楚  那个地方太可怕了
Well, then you'll know all about it, and, oh, what a terrible country it is.

469
00:45:37,460 --> 00:45:39,790
整片土地上只有茂密的丛林...
The whole place is nothing but thick jungles...

470
00:45:39,960 --> 00:45:43,550
到处都是全世界最危险的怪兽
infested by the most dangerous beasts in the entire world.

471
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:48,860
独角兽和怪鼻兽 还有可怕又邪恶的丑怪兽
Hornswogglers and snozzwangers and those terrible, wicked whangdoodles.

472
00:46:09,990 --> 00:46:13,930
我去伦柏地找异国风糖果口味
I went to Loompaland looking for exotic new flavors for candy.

473
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:19,290
结果却...
Instead...

474
00:46:19,470 --> 00:46:21,490
找到奥柏伦柏人
I found the Oompa-Loompas.

475
00:46:29,640 --> 00:46:34,600
他们住在树屋里 躲避地面上的凶猛怪兽
They lived in tree houses to escape from the fierce creatures who lived below.

476
00:46:38,150 --> 00:46:42,380
奥柏伦柏人只能吃非常难吃的绿毛虫
The Oompa-Loompas ate nothing but green caterpillars, which tasted revolting.

477
00:46:43,760 --> 00:46:45,750
他们一直找别的东西...
The Oompa-Loompas looked for other things...

478
00:46:45,930 --> 00:46:48,760
来拌毛虫糊  看能不能好吃一点
to mash up with the caterpillars to make them taste better:

479
00:46:48,930 --> 00:46:52,370
红甲虫  梆梆树皮
Red beetles, the bark of the bong-bong tree.

480
00:46:52,530 --> 00:46:53,800
全都不好吃...
All of them beastly...

481
00:46:54,340 --> 00:46:56,960
但比光吃毛毛虫好吃多啦
but not quite so beastly as the caterpillars.

482
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:33,690
但他们最想吃的食物是可可豆
But the food they longed for the most was the cocoa bean.

483
00:47:37,220 --> 00:47:40,920
每个奥柏伦柏人一年能找到 三四颗可可豆就算幸运了
An Oompa-Loompa was lucky if he found three or four cocoa beans a year.

484
00:47:41,090 --> 00:47:43,490
他们超爱吃可可豆
But, oh, how they craved them.

485
00:47:44,730 --> 00:47:47,830
他们整天只想着可可豆
All they'd ever think about was cocoa beans.

486
00:47:53,240 --> 00:47:57,540
可可豆是巧克力的原料 于是我跟酋长说...
The cocoa bean is the thing from which chocolate is made, so I told the chief:

487
00:47:57,710 --> 00:48:00,150
(搬来我的工厂住吧)

488
00:48:00,310 --> 00:48:03,540
(你们想吃多少可可豆都行)

489
00:48:03,720 --> 00:48:07,450
(我也可用可可豆当你们的工资)

490
00:48:18,200 --> 00:48:20,890
他们都是勤劳的工人
They are such wonderful workers.

491
00:48:21,070 --> 00:48:24,000
但我警告你们  他们很顽皮
I feel I must warn you, though, they are rather mischievous.

492
00:48:24,170 --> 00:48:26,110
一天到晚恶作剧
Always making jokes.

493
00:48:26,410 --> 00:48:29,860
奥古塔斯  千万别那样做
Augustus, my child, that is not a good thing you do!

494
00:48:32,410 --> 00:48:33,880
小男孩
Hey, little boy.

495
00:48:34,050 --> 00:48:37,110
不要用手去碰我的巧克力
My chocolate must be untouched by human hands.

496
00:48:44,090 --> 00:48:45,560
他会溺死的
He'll drown.

497
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:48,520
他不会游泳
He can't swim.

498
00:48:48,700 --> 00:48:50,250
快救他!
Save him!

499
00:48:51,470 --> 00:48:54,260
奥古塔斯!  不!
Augustus! No!

500
00:49:00,580 --> 00:49:02,630
奥古塔斯!
Augustus!

501
00:49:11,650 --> 00:49:14,620
奥古塔斯  小心!
Augustus, watch out!

502
00:49:31,110 --> 00:49:32,700
他被吸上去了
There he goes.

503
00:49:34,280 --> 00:49:35,940
快来人  救命啊!
Call the fire brigade!

504
00:49:36,110 --> 00:49:38,410
那根管子居然够粗耶
It's a wonder how that pipe is big enough.

505
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:41,480
不够粗啦 他慢下来了
It isn't big enough. He's slowing down.

506
00:49:41,650 --> 00:49:42,910
他会卡住的
He's gonna stick.

507
00:49:44,520 --> 00:49:45,820
已经卡住了
I think he has.

508
00:49:49,360 --> 00:49:50,850
整根管子都被他塞住了
He's blocked the whole pipe.

509
00:49:53,900 --> 00:49:55,860
你们看  奥柏伦柏人
Look. The Oompa-Loompas.

510
00:50:04,100 --> 00:50:05,700
他们在干嘛?
What are they doing?

511
00:50:08,080 --> 00:50:12,030
他们应该是想唱歌给我们听 这是很特别的场合
They're going to treat us to a little song. It is quite a special occasion.

512
00:50:12,210 --> 00:50:14,440
他们很久没观众了
They haven't had a fresh audience in many a moon.

513
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:36,890
奥古塔斯·格卢普...
Augustus Gloop, Augustus Gloop...

514
00:50:37,470 --> 00:50:39,800
那个贪吃的大傻瓜
The great big, greedy nincompoop

515
00:50:39,970 --> 00:50:44,880
奥古塔斯·格卢普  又肥又皮  贪婪可恶又幼稚
Augustus Gloop, so big and vile So greedy, foul and infantile

516
00:50:45,050 --> 00:50:47,340
我们叫道: 时机已成熟
"Come on!" we cried "The time is ripe

517
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:50,070
把他弄到玻璃管里去
To send him shooting up the pipe!"

518
00:50:50,250 --> 00:50:52,550
不过亲爱的小朋友们  不必害怕
But don't, dear children, be alarmed

519
00:50:52,820 --> 00:50:55,310
奥古塔斯·格卢普不会出事
Augustus Gloop will not be harmed

520
00:50:55,490 --> 00:50:57,750
奥古塔斯·格卢普不会出事
Augustus Gloop will not be harmed

521
00:51:29,220 --> 00:51:31,210
当然  我们必须承认
Although, of course, we must admit

522
00:51:31,390 --> 00:51:33,620
他将有不少改变
He will be altered quite a bit

523
00:51:34,230 --> 00:51:36,750
轮子慢慢地转了一下又一下
Slowly, wheels go round and round

524
00:51:36,930 --> 00:51:39,230
齿轮开始又磨又压...
And cogs begin to grind and pound...

525
00:52:35,140 --> 00:52:37,080
赞啊!  表演得真棒
Bravo! Well done!

526
00:52:37,250 --> 00:52:39,470
他们很可爱  很讨人喜欢吧?
Aren't they delightful? Aren't they charming?

527
00:52:39,650 --> 00:52:44,140
-这段歌舞好像是彩排好的 -他们好像知道会发生什么事
-I do say, that all seemed rather rehearsed. -Like they knew it was gonna happen.

528
00:52:44,850 --> 00:52:46,610
少胡说八道了
Oh, poppycock.

529
00:52:49,820 --> 00:52:52,420
我儿子呢?  那根管子通往哪里?
Where is my son? Where does that pipe go to?

530
00:52:54,130 --> 00:52:56,390
那根管子直通另一个房间...
That pipe, it just so happens to lead...

531
00:52:56,560 --> 00:52:58,830
那个房间是制造最美味的...
directly to the room where I make delicious...

532
00:52:59,000 --> 00:53:01,490
草莓牛奶巧克力夹心软糖
strawberry-flavored, chocolate-coated fudge.

533
00:53:01,670 --> 00:53:05,200
那他就要被做成 草莓牛奶巧克力夹心软糖
Then he will be made into strawberry-flavored, chocolate-coated fudge.

534
00:53:05,370 --> 00:53:08,900
在世界各地称斤论两的卖了
They'll be selling him by the pound all over the world?

535
00:53:09,080 --> 00:53:11,980
不行  我绝对不允许 那一定很难吃
No. I wouldn't allow it. The taste would be terrible.

536
00:53:12,550 --> 00:53:15,740
你能想像...奥古塔斯口味的巧克力糖吗?
Can you imagine Augustus-flavored, chocolate-coated Gloop?

537
00:53:16,650 --> 00:53:17,810
没人会买的
No one would buy it.

538
00:53:26,660 --> 00:53:29,930
请你带格卢普太太去软糖间
I want you to take Mrs. Gloop up to the Fudge Room, okay?

539
00:53:30,100 --> 00:53:31,590
帮忙找她儿子
Help her find her son.

540
00:53:31,770 --> 00:53:37,360
拿一根长棍子 在搅拌巧克力的木桶里探探看  懂吗
Take a long stick and start poking around in the big chocolate-mixing barrel, okay?

541
00:53:54,120 --> 00:53:55,710
旺卡先生?
Mr. Wonka?

542
00:53:56,060 --> 00:53:59,590
奥柏伦柏人唱的歌 怎会有奥古塔斯的名字? 除非他们...
Why would Augustus' name already be in the Oompa-Loompa song, unless...?

543
00:53:59,760 --> 00:54:03,320
即兴演出很简单 谁都会表演
Improvisation is a parlor trick. Anyone can do it.

544
00:54:03,970 --> 00:54:05,700
小女孩  说点什么吧
You, little girl. Say something.

545
00:54:05,870 --> 00:54:07,860
-随便什么都好 -口香糖
-Anything. -Chewing gum.

546
00:54:08,440 --> 00:54:11,100
口香糖实在恶心 口香糖我最唾弃
Chewing gum is really gross Chewing gum, I hate the most

547
00:54:11,270 --> 00:54:13,300
看吧?  就是这样啊
See? Exactly the same.

548
00:54:13,480 --> 00:54:14,910
才不一样呢
No, it isn't.

549
00:54:15,950 --> 00:54:17,670
你不该碎碎念
You really shouldn't mumble.

550
00:54:17,850 --> 00:54:20,040
因为你说的话我一个字也听不懂
Because I can't understand a word you're saying.

551
00:54:22,250 --> 00:54:25,050
现在...继续参观吧
Now, on with the tour.

552
00:54:27,790 --> 00:54:31,730
-奥柏伦柏人真的是在开玩笑吗 -当然是在开玩笑
-Are the Oompa-Loompas really joking? -Of course they're joking.

553
00:54:31,900 --> 00:54:34,360
那个孩子不会有事的
That boy will be fine.

554
00:55:23,350 --> 00:55:24,580
有什么好笑的?
What's so funny?

555
00:55:25,350 --> 00:55:28,080
应该是吃了太多可可豆吧
I think it's from all those doggone cocoa beans.

556
00:55:28,250 --> 00:55:32,160
对了  你们知不知道  巧克力有一种成份...
Hey, by the way, did you guys know that chocolate contains a property...

557
00:55:32,330 --> 00:55:37,130
能刺激脑内啡的分泌 给人恋爱般的愉悦感觉?
that triggers the release of endorphins? Gives one the feeling of being in love.

558
00:55:37,500 --> 00:55:38,980
这样啊
You don't say.

559
00:55:41,870 --> 00:55:43,770
上船啰
All aboard.

560
00:55:54,280 --> 00:55:55,510
前进!
Onward!

561
00:56:19,470 --> 00:56:21,030
来吧
Here.

562
00:56:21,210 --> 00:56:25,740
喝一点  对你有好处 你看起来好像快饿死了
Try some of this. It'll do you good. You look starved to death.

563
00:56:27,250 --> 00:56:31,710
-好好喝哦 -因为这是用瀑布搅拌的
-It's great. -That's because it's mixed by waterfall.

564
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:33,370
瀑布是最重要的关键
The waterfall is most important.

565
00:56:33,550 --> 00:56:37,780
混合巧克力  搅拌均匀 让巧克力滑溜又顺口
Mixes the chocolate, churns it up, makes it light and frothy.

566
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:42,450
-对了  全世界没有别的工厂... -你已经说过了
-By the way, no other factory in the world...-You already said that.

567
00:56:48,000 --> 00:56:51,660
-你们都很矮哦 -对  我们是小孩啊
-You're all quite short, aren't you? -Well, yeah. We're children.

568
00:56:51,840 --> 00:56:54,470
那不是理由  我就从没像你那么矮
Well, that's no excuse. I was never as short as you.

569
00:56:54,640 --> 00:56:57,940
-你小时候也一样啦 -才没有  你知道为什么吗?
-You were once. -Was not. Know why?

570
00:56:58,110 --> 00:57:01,810
因为我随时都记得戴上帽子
Because I distinctly remember putting a hat on top of my head.

571
00:57:01,980 --> 00:57:05,820
不像你手那么短  永远够不到头
Look at your short, little arms. You could never reach.

572
00:57:08,320 --> 00:57:10,590
你记不记得小时候的事?
Do you even remember what it was like being a kid?

573
00:57:10,760 --> 00:57:12,850
当然记得
Oh, boy, do I.

574
00:57:16,460 --> 00:57:17,730
是吗?
Do I?

575

露西  薇洛妮卡  泰伦斯

581
00:57:44,490 --> 00:57:46,020
那个披着白布的是谁?
And who's that under the sheet?

582
00:57:48,230 --> 00:57:51,290
原来是小威利·旺卡
Little Willy Wonka.

583
00:57:54,100 --> 00:57:58,600
威利·旺卡的父亲是城里 最有名的牙医...

589
00:58:28,770 --> 00:58:32,070
吃这个会卡在牙套上  对吧?

590
00:58:36,510 --> 00:58:38,880
棒棒糖
Lollipops.

591
00:58:39,050 --> 00:58:42,780
应该叫它"插在棒子上的蛀牙"
Ought to be called "cavities on a stick."

592
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:45,420
然后还有这些...

00:59:05,480 --> 00:59:07,030
让我吃一小块看看
I could try a piece.

600
00:59:07,210 --> 00:59:08,910
真的吗?
Really?

601
00:59:09,080 --> 00:59:11,100
何必冒这个险呢?
But why take a chance?

602
00:59:26,630 --> 00:59:29,460
旺卡先生?
Mr. Wonka? Mr. Wonka?

他们完全不知道船往哪儿去
There's no knowing where they're going.

607
00:59:46,120 --> 00:59:47,340
开灯!
Switch on the lights!

608
01:00:14,980 --> 01:00:16,570
各位  注意看
People, keep an eye out.

609
01:00:16,750 --> 01:00:18,810

01:00:39,210 --> 01:00:40,360
这样做没道理啊
That doesn't make sense.

617
01:00:41,570 --> 01:00:43,230
告诉你吧  小女孩...
For your information, little girl...

618
01:00:43,410 --> 01:00:47,240
没用鞭子一打再打 就不算是打泡奶油
whipped cream isn't whipped cream at all unless it's been whipped with whips.

619
01:00:47,410 --> 01:00:49,540
这是众所周知的
Everybody knows that.

620
01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:20,170

633
01:02:43,400 --> 01:02:45,700
-很棒吧?  -像口香糖一样
-Isn't that neat? -It's like gum.

634
01:02:46,300 --> 01:02:48,860
不对  口香糖要嚼
No. Gum is for chewing.

635
01:02:49,040 --> 01:02:51,270
若想嚼这种石头弹子糖...
If you tried chewing one of these Gobstoppers...

636
01:02:51,440 --> 01:02:53,470
你的小牙齿会碎光光

不需要厨房  也不必煮饭了

-怎么回事? -我早说过还没完全做好嘛
-What's happening? -Well, I told you I hadn't quite got it right.

685
01:06:22,760 --> 01:06:25,820
因为到了甜点就会怪怪的
Because it goes a little funny when it gets to the dessert.

有二十个奥柏伦柏人试吃过了 每一个都变成蓝莓
I've tried it on, like, 20 Oompa-Loompas, and each one ended up as a blueberry.

692
01:07:35,130 --> 01:07:36,930
真是太奇怪了
It's just weird.

693
01:07:37,100 --> 01:07:39,070
蓝莓不能当我女儿
But I can't have a blueberry as a daughter.

694
01:07:39,240 --> 01:07:40,830
她要怎么比赛?
How is she supposed to compete?

695
01:07:41,000 --> 01:07:42,660
可以参加农产品大赛
You could put her in a county fair.

She goes on chewing till, at last

708
01:08:38,530 --> 01:08:40,650
最后由于肌肉变得特别发达
Her chewing muscles grow so vast

709
01:08:40,830 --> 01:08:43,130
下巴便从她的脸上
And from her face Her giant chin

710
01:08:43,300 --> 01:08:45,630
像小提琴一样翘了起来
Sticks out just like a violin

她年复一年  嚼啊嚼
For years and years she chews away

715
01:08:59,820 --> 01:09:02,180
下颚一天比一天更有力
Her jaws get stronger every day

716
01:09:02,350 --> 01:09:04,510

717
01:09:04,690 --> 01:09:06,880
竟咬断了这位小姐的舌头
They bite the poor girl's tongue in two

718
01:09:07,160 --> 01:09:09,210
正是因为这个缘故 我们要尽力...

Chewing, chewing all day long

723
01:09:19,370 --> 01:09:21,860
从早到晚嚼口香糖
Chewing, chewing all day long

724
01:09:22,040 --> 01:09:24,030
从早到晚嚼口香糖
Chewing, chewing all day long

725
01:09:24,210 --> 01:09:26,470
从早到晚嚼口香糖
Chewing, chewing all day long

726
01:09:26,640 --> 01:09:27,970
从早到晚嚼口香糖
Chewing, chewing all day long

727
01:09:28,150 --> 01:09:30,340
旺卡先生!
Mr. Wonka!

728
01:09:35,720 --> 01:09:38,190
把博雷加德小姐滚到船上...
I want you to roll Miss Beauregarde into the boat...

729
01:09:38,360 --> 01:09:42,120
马上带她去榨汁间
and take her along to the Juicing Room at once, okay?

730
01:09:42,730 --> 01:09:45,190
榨汁间?  他们会怎么处理她?
Juicing Room? What are they gonna do to her there?

731
01:09:45,830 --> 01:09:47,520
他们会挤榨她
They're gonna squeeze her.

732
01:09:47,700 --> 01:09:49,670
像挤痘子一样
Like a little pimple.

733
01:09:50,570 --> 01:09:53,540
我们要马上榨干她全身的果汁
We gotta squeeze all that juice out of her immediately.

734
01:09:56,840 --> 01:09:58,400
妈  救我!
Mother, help me.

735
01:09:58,580 --> 01:10:00,240
求求你!
Please.

736
01:10:05,350 --> 01:10:07,010
走吧
Come on.

737
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:08,850
我们还得赶路呢
Let's boogie.

738
01:10:09,190 --> 01:10:12,380
不坐船要加快脚步才能赶上进度
Without the boat, we'll have to move double-time to keep on schedule.

739
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:13,850
东西太多会看不完
There's far too much to see.

740
01:10:14,030 --> 01:10:15,080
-旺卡先生?  -恩?
-Mr. Wonka? -Yeah?

741
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:17,050
你为什么决定让人进来呢?
Why did you decide to let people in?

742
01:10:17,360 --> 01:10:19,230
当然是参观工厂啊
So they could see the factory, of course.

743
01:10:19,500 --> 01:10:21,860
但为何是现在?  为何才五个人?
But why now? And why only five?

744
01:10:22,030 --> 01:10:24,330
大奖是什么?  谁能得到?
What's the special prize, and who gets it?

745
01:10:24,500 --> 01:10:27,600
最特别的大奖是一个惊喜
The best kind of prize is a surprise.

746
01:10:27,970 --> 01:10:29,870
紫罗兰要永远当蓝莓吗?
Will Violet always be a blueberry?

747
01:10:30,040 --> 01:10:32,130
不会  或许吧  我不知道
No. Maybe. I don't know.

748
01:10:32,540 --> 01:10:35,410
但整天嚼口香糖就有这种下场 太恶心了
That's what you get from chewing gum all day. It's disgusting.

749
01:10:35,680 --> 01:10:38,050
你那么讨厌口香糖  做来干嘛?
If you hate gum so much, why do you make it?

750
01:10:38,220 --> 01:10:41,120
我再说一次  别碎碎念 不然我要生气了
Once again, you shouldn't mumble. It's starting to bum me out.

751
01:10:41,290 --> 01:10:44,190
你记得你吃的第一颗糖吗?
Can you remember the first candy you ever ate?

752
01:10:47,790 --> 01:10:49,020
不记得
No.

753
01:10:49,190 --> 01:10:55,360
其实威利·旺卡记得一清二楚 他吃过的第一颗糖果
In fact, Willy Wonka did remember the first candy he ever ate.

754
01:11:36,180 --> 01:11:38,510
(坚果口感 很好吃  余味十足)

755
01:11:55,360 --> 01:11:58,630
对不起  我回想起从前了
I'm sorry, I was having a flashback.

756
01:11:59,270 --> 01:12:01,030
看得出来
I see.

757
01:12:01,370 --> 01:12:03,300
你经常回想从前吗?
These flashbacks happen often?

758
01:12:03,470 --> 01:12:05,440
愈来愈常了...
Increasingly...

759
01:12:05,740 --> 01:12:07,370
就今天
today.

760
01:12:09,810 --> 01:12:11,240
(果仁间)

761
01:12:14,820 --> 01:12:16,610
这个我最了解了
This is a room I know all about.

762
01:12:16,780 --> 01:12:19,910
旺卡先生  我本人是从事坚果业
For you see, Mr. Wonka, I, myself, am in the nut business.

763
01:12:20,090 --> 01:12:23,490
你是用海佛麦四千型来分类吗?
Are you using the Havermax 4000 to do your sorting?

764
01:12:23,660 --> 01:12:25,280
不是
No.

765
01:12:25,460 --> 01:12:26,860
你真是个怪人
You're really weird.

766
01:12:48,250 --> 01:12:50,980
-松鼠  -对  松鼠
-Squirrels. -Yeah. Squirrels.

767
01:12:51,150 --> 01:12:54,350
这些松鼠受过取果仁的特殊训练
These squirrels are specially trained to get the nuts out of shells.

768
01:13:10,770 --> 01:13:13,260
松鼠?  干嘛不用奥柏伦柏人?
Why use squirrels? Why not use Oompa-Loompas?

769
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:17,900
只有松鼠能完整地取出胡桃果仁
Because only squirrels can get the whole walnut out almost every single time.

770
01:13:18,580 --> 01:13:21,740
它们用指关节轻敲每个胡桃 确定是好或坏
See how they tap them with their knuckles to make sure it's not bad?

771
01:13:22,190 --> 01:13:23,410
你们看
Oh, look. Look.

772
01:13:25,220 --> 01:13:26,810
那个应该是坏坚果
I think that one's got a bad nut.

773
01:13:29,190 --> 01:13:30,890
爸爸  我要一只松鼠
Daddy, I want a squirrel.

774
01:13:31,060 --> 01:13:33,290
抓一只松鼠给我  我要一只
Get me one of those squirrels. I want one.

775
01:13:33,730 --> 01:13:36,460
维露卡  你有很多的宠物了
Veruca, dear, you have many marvelous pets.

776
01:13:36,630 --> 01:13:38,610
我家里只有一匹小马和两条狗
All I've got at home is one pony and two dogs 

777
01:13:38,611 --> 01:13:40,590
四只猫 六只小白兔...
and four cats and six bunny rabbits...

778
01:13:40,770 --> 01:13:44,170
两只鹦哥  三只金丝雀 一只绿鹦鹉  一只乌龟...
and two parakeets and three canaries and a green parrot and a turtle...

779
01:13:44,340 --> 01:13:47,430
和一只笨颊鼠 我要一只松鼠!
and a silly old hamster. I want a squirrel!

780
01:13:48,010 --> 01:13:49,240
好吧  爸爸会想办法
All right, pet.

781
01:13:49,410 --> 01:13:52,010
尽快给你一只松鼠
Daddy will get you a squirrel as soon as he possibly can.

782
01:13:52,180 --> 01:13:55,740
我不要普通的松鼠 我要受过训练的松鼠
But I don't want any old squirrel, I want a trained squirrel.

783
01:13:57,090 --> 01:13:58,680
好吧
Very well.

784
01:13:58,960 --> 01:14:02,190
旺卡先生  一只松鼠多少钱?
Mr. Wonka, how much do you want for one of these squirrels?

785
01:14:02,360 --> 01:14:04,330
请你开个价吧
Name your price.

786
01:14:05,200 --> 01:14:07,790
这是非卖品  一只也不能卖
Oh, they're not for sale. She can't have one.

787
01:14:12,800 --> 01:14:14,390
爸爸
Daddy.

788
01:14:16,070 --> 01:14:17,300
对不起  甜心
I'm sorry, darling.

789
01:14:17,780 --> 01:14:19,940
旺卡先生太不讲理了
Mr. Wonka's being unreasonable.

790
01:14:22,580 --> 01:14:26,110
你不给我松鼠  我就自己去抓
If you won't get me a squirrel, I'll get one myself.

791
01:14:34,990 --> 01:14:36,420
维露卡
Veruca.

792
01:14:38,060 --> 01:14:39,430
小女孩?
Little girl?

793
01:14:43,230 --> 01:14:45,060
维露卡  快给我回来啊
Veruca, come back here at once.

794
01:14:47,670 --> 01:14:49,300
维露卡
Veruca.

795
01:15:01,190 --> 01:15:02,620
小女孩
Little girl?

796
01:15:03,120 --> 01:15:04,880
别碰松鼠的坚果
Don't touch that squirrel's nuts.

797
01:15:05,060 --> 01:15:07,150
它会抓狂的
It'll make him crazy.

798
01:15:23,480 --> 01:15:24,940
我就选你吧
I'll have you.

799
01:15:30,180 --> 01:15:31,610
维露卡
Veruca.

800
01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:39,250
维露卡
Veruca.

801
01:15:41,460 --> 01:15:42,980
不要!
No!

802
01:15:47,370 --> 01:15:48,730
维露卡!
Veruca!

803
01:15:51,070 --> 01:15:53,230
先找到钥匙再说
Let's find the key.

804
01:15:54,710 --> 01:15:56,040
不对  不是这一把
Nope. Not that one.

805
01:15:57,140 --> 01:15:59,370
-爸爸!  -维露卡!
-Daddy! -Veruca!

806
01:16:00,380 --> 01:16:02,570
不对  不是那
No. It's not that one.

807
01:16:14,190 --> 01:16:15,920
找到了
There it is.

808
01:16:16,100 --> 01:16:17,320
找错了
There it isn't.

809
01:16:17,500 --> 01:16:19,230
爸爸  叫它们住手!
Daddy, I want them to stop.

810
01:16:29,980 --> 01:16:31,410
它们在干嘛?
What are they doing?

811
01:16:31,580 --> 01:16:33,570
它们在检查她是不是坏坚果
They're testing to see if she's a bad nut.

812
01:16:35,680 --> 01:16:38,480
天哪  她终究是个坏坚果
Oh, my goodness. She is a bad nut after all.

813
01:16:45,660 --> 01:16:46,960
维露卡!
Veruca!

814
01:16:47,560 --> 01:16:48,930
爸爸!
Daddy!

815
01:16:49,100 --> 01:16:50,620
它们要带她去哪里?
Where are they taking her?

816
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:53,600
所有坏坚果都要扔进垃圾滑槽
Where all the other bad nuts go. To the garbage chute.

817
01:16:54,570 --> 01:16:55,970
滑槽通往哪里?
Where does the chute go?

818
01:16:56,140 --> 01:16:57,360
通往焚化炉
To the incinerator.

819
01:16:58,140 --> 01:17:00,540
但别担心  只有礼拜二才会焚烧
But don't worry. We only light it on Tuesdays.

820
01:17:00,710 --> 01:17:02,300
今天就是礼拜二
Today is Tuesday.

821
01:17:04,480 --> 01:17:07,540
他们有可能决定今天不焚烧
Well, there's always the chance they decided not to light it today.

822
01:17:25,900 --> 01:17:28,870
说不定她刚掉下去 就卡在滑槽里了
Now, she may be stuck in the chute just below the top.

823
01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:32,630
真是这样  你就伸手拉她出来就好了
If that's the case, all you have to do is just reach in and pull her out.

824
01:17:33,510 --> 01:17:34,740
懂吗?
Okay?

825
01:18:12,750 --> 01:18:15,910
维露卡·索尔特  这个小野蛮
Veruca Salt, the little brute

826
01:18:16,090 --> 01:18:19,180
刚落下了垃圾滑槽
Has just gone down the garbage chute

827
01:18:19,360 --> 01:18:23,450
她沿着垃圾滑槽落到下面
And she will meet, as she descends

828
01:18:23,630 --> 01:18:26,860
将要遇到一班完全不同的朋友
A rather different set of friends

829
01:18:27,030 --> 01:18:29,960
一班完全不同的朋友
A rather different set of friends

830
01:18:30,130 --> 01:18:33,800
一班完全不同的朋友
A rather different set of friends

831
01:18:33,970 --> 01:18:37,060
比方说  她会遇见一个鱼头
A fish head, for example, cut

832
01:18:37,240 --> 01:18:40,330
这是今天早晨杀的比目鱼
This morning from a halibut

833
01:18:40,510 --> 01:18:43,780
一只煨蚝  已经发臭
An oyster from an oyster stew

834
01:18:43,950 --> 01:18:47,680
一块谁也嚼不动的牛肉
A steak that no one else would chew

835
01:18:47,850 --> 01:18:51,180
还有许许多多别的垃圾
And lots of other things as well

836
01:18:51,360 --> 01:18:57,490
每样都是臭气扑鼻
Each with its rather horrid smell

837
01:18:57,660 --> 01:19:01,390
臭气扑鼻
Horrid smell

838
01:19:01,730 --> 01:19:04,930
这些便是维露卡的新朋友
These are Veruca's newfound friends

839
01:19:05,100 --> 01:19:08,660
等她下去  就会碰头
That she will meet as she descends

840
01:19:08,840 --> 01:19:14,070
这些便是维露卡的新朋友
These are Veruca's newfound friends

841
01:19:33,200 --> 01:19:36,720
到底是谁宠坏她?
Who went and spoiled her, who indeed?

842
01:19:36,900 --> 01:19:40,340
是谁答应她所有的要求?
Who pandered to her every need?

843
01:19:40,510 --> 01:19:43,700
是谁使她变得这样坏?
Who turned her into such a brat?

844
01:19:43,880 --> 01:19:45,670
谁是罪魁祸首?
Who are the culprits?

845
01:19:45,840 --> 01:19:47,330
到底是谁?
Who did that?

846
01:19:47,510 --> 01:19:50,780
说出这话  我实在难过
The guilty ones, now this is sad

847
01:19:50,950 --> 01:19:54,650
罪人就是她亲爱的妈妈和爸爸
Are dear old Mum and loving Dad

848
01:20:05,230 --> 01:20:07,530
真的吗? 太好了
Oh, really? Oh, good.

849
01:20:07,830 --> 01:20:10,300
我刚才得知焚化炉坏掉了
I've just been informed that the incinerator's broken.

850
01:20:10,470 --> 01:20:14,000
所以他们应该会落在垃圾堆上
So there should be about three weeks of rotten garbage to break their fall.

851
01:20:14,170 --> 01:20:15,660
这倒是个好消息
Well, that's good news.

852
01:20:15,980 --> 01:20:17,460
是啊
Yeah.

853
01:20:17,980 --> 01:20:20,840
我们继续走吧
Well, let's keep on trucking.

854
01:20:23,420 --> 01:20:25,350
我怎么没早点想到
I don't know why I didn't think of this.

855
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:28,980
要在工厂里走动 最快的方法就是搭电梯
The elevator's by far the most efficient way to get around the factory.

856
01:20:29,160 --> 01:20:30,990
不可能有这么多楼层
There can't be this many floors.

857
01:20:31,860 --> 01:20:33,980
你又知道了?  自以为是先生?
How do you know, Mr. Smarty-Pants?

858
01:20:34,160 --> 01:20:36,960
这不是只能上下移动的普通电梯
This isn't just an ordinary up-and-down elevator, by the way.

859
01:20:37,130 --> 01:20:39,600
这电梯可以侧着  纵着  斜着跑...
This elevator can go sideways, longways, slantways...

860
01:20:39,770 --> 01:20:41,360
任何方向都可以
and any other ways you can think of.

861
01:20:41,540 --> 01:20:44,440
只要按下任何按钮 咻一下就到了
You just press any button and, whoosh, you're off.

862
01:20:54,610 --> 01:20:55,880
你们看!
Oh, look. Look.

863
01:20:57,180 --> 01:21:00,280
各位女士先生  欢迎来到软糖山
Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to Fudge Mountain.

864
01:21:29,320 --> 01:21:31,110
这个不提也罢了
I'd rather not talk about this one.

865
01:21:42,430 --> 01:21:44,620
这是木偶医院和烧烫伤中心
This is the Puppet Hospital and Burn Center.

866
01:21:49,170 --> 01:21:51,970
这是新设立的
It's relatively new.

867
01:21:58,650 --> 01:22:00,140
行政办公室
The administration offices.

868
01:22:02,320 --> 01:22:03,720
嗨  桃乐丝
Hello, Doris.

869
01:22:06,120 --> 01:22:09,110
(危险)

870
01:22:39,060 --> 01:22:41,820
为什么这里的一切都毫无意义?
Why is everything here completely pointless?

871
01:22:41,990 --> 01:22:43,980
糖果不需要有意义啊
Candy doesn't have to have a point.

872
01:22:44,160 --> 01:22:45,520
所以才是糖果嘛
That's why it's candy.

873
01:22:45,700 --> 01:22:47,160
太荒谬了
It's stupid.

874
01:22:47,730 --> 01:22:50,930
糖果是在浪费时间
Candy is a waste of time.

875
01:22:51,570 --> 01:22:54,800
我儿子绝对不可能去做巧克力
No son of mine is going to be a chocolatier.

876
01:22:55,340 --> 01:22:56,900
那我逃走算了
Then I'll run away.

877
01:22:57,070 --> 01:22:59,200
逃去瑞士或巴伐利亚
To Switzerland. Bavaria.

878
01:22:59,440 --> 01:23:01,340
全世界的糖果重镇
The candy capitals of the world.

879
01:23:02,080 --> 01:23:03,410
去啊
Go ahead.

880
01:23:03,580 --> 01:23:05,410
等你回来的时  我就不在了
But I won't be here when you come back.

881
01:23:33,980 --> 01:23:35,270
抱歉
Sorry, son.

882
01:23:35,450 --> 01:23:37,940
今晚的营业时间到了
We're closing for the night.

883
01:23:40,850 --> 01:23:43,840
(万国旗展览场)

884
01:24:03,370 --> 01:24:05,030
我要选一个房间
I wanna pick a room.

885
01:24:08,080 --> 01:24:09,550
请便
Go ahead.

886
01:24:11,420 --> 01:24:13,440
(电视间)

887
01:24:28,400 --> 01:24:29,700
拿着
Here.

888
01:24:30,170 --> 01:24:33,070
赶快戴上  无论如何都别摘下来
Put these on quick, and don't take them off whatever you do.

889
01:24:33,740 --> 01:24:36,670
这光线会烧得你眼珠子突出来
This light could burn your eyeballs right out of your skulls.

890
01:24:37,010 --> 01:24:39,940
这种事还是别发生得好  对吧?
And we certainly don't want that, now, do we?

891
01:24:42,820 --> 01:24:46,510
我们在这里测试 我最新最伟大的发明
This is the testing room for my very latest and greatest invention:

892
01:24:46,920 --> 01:24:49,390
电视巧克力糖
Television Chocolate.

893
01:24:49,560 --> 01:24:50,780
有一天我突发奇想
One day it occurred to me:

894
01:24:50,960 --> 01:24:53,690
如果电视能把一张照片
"Hey, if television can break up a photograph...

895
01:24:53,860 --> 01:24:57,760
分解成几百万个小微粒 迅速地在空中传送...
into millions and millions of tiny pieces and send it whizzing through the air...

896
01:24:57,930 --> 01:24:59,800
然后到另一端重新组合...
then reassemble it on the other end...

897
01:24:59,970 --> 01:25:02,020
我何不用巧克力试试看呢?
why can't I do the same with chocolate?

898
01:25:02,470 --> 01:25:07,870
把一块真正的巧克力糖 透过电视传送 伸手就能吃
Why can't I send a real bar of chocolate through the television, ready to be eaten?"

899
01:25:08,040 --> 01:25:11,770
我才不想提  我又不谈那个话题
I'm not gonna touch it. I'm not going in that direction.

900
01:25:13,210 --> 01:25:14,440
好像是不可能的事
Sounds impossible.

901
01:25:14,910 --> 01:25:16,240
本来就不可能
It is impossible.

902
01:25:17,220 --> 01:25:19,880
你对科学一窍不通
You don't understand anything about science.

903
01:25:20,050 --> 01:25:24,490
首先  电波和分子微粒不一样 常识嘛
First off, there's a difference between waves and particles.

904
01:25:25,290 --> 01:25:28,890
其次  将能量转换成物质的动力...
Second, the amount of power it would take to convert energy in matter...

905
01:25:29,260 --> 01:25:30,850
相当于九颗原子弹
would be like nine atomic bombs.

906
01:25:31,060 --> 01:25:32,530
又在碎碎念!
Mumbler!

907
01:25:33,370 --> 01:25:37,320
说真的 你说的话我一个字也听不懂
Seriously, I cannot understand a single word you're saying.

908
01:25:40,940 --> 01:25:42,410
好了
Okey-dokey.

909
01:25:42,580 --> 01:25:45,910
我现在要把一块巧克力糖 从房间的一端...
I shall now send a bar of chocolate from one end of the room...

910
01:25:46,080 --> 01:25:49,140
透过电视传送到另一端
to the other by television.

911
01:25:49,320 --> 01:25:50,680
去拿巧克力来
Bring in the chocolate.

912
01:26:11,510 --> 01:26:14,170
一定要超大才行 因为在电视上...
It's gotta be real big because you know how on TV...

913
01:26:14,340 --> 01:26:17,710
正常人会被拍的变这么小
you can film a regular-size man, and he comes out looking this tall?

914
01:26:17,880 --> 01:26:19,310
这是基本原理
Same basic principle.

915
01:26:51,280 --> 01:26:52,870
不见了
It's gone.

916
01:26:53,950 --> 01:26:57,980
我就说嘛 那块巧克力正从我们头顶上飞过...
Told you. That bar of chocolate is now rushing through the air above our heads...

917
01:26:58,150 --> 01:27:00,590
分解成上百万个小微粒
in a million tiny little pieces.

918
01:27:00,760 --> 01:27:03,660
过来这里  快点 快过来  快啊
Come over here. Come on. Come on. Come on!

919
01:27:09,230 --> 01:27:10,990
看着荧幕
Watch the screen.

920
01:27:14,370 --> 01:27:16,000
出现了
Here it comes.

921
01:27:17,070 --> 01:27:18,660
你们看
Oh, look.

922
01:27:22,750 --> 01:27:25,470
-伸手去拿 -那只是荧幕上的画面啦
-Take it. -It's just a picture on a screen.

923
01:27:26,420 --> 01:27:27,680
胆小鬼
Scaredy-cat.

924
01:27:27,850 --> 01:27:29,340
你拿
You take it.

925
01:27:30,190 --> 01:27:32,450
快去  伸手去拿出来
Go on. Just reach out and grab it.

926
01:27:40,660 --> 01:27:42,150
快点啊
Go on.

927
01:27:50,140 --> 01:27:51,970
我的老天
Holy buckets.

928
01:27:55,010 --> 01:27:57,100
吃吃看  快点
Eat it. Go on.

929
01:27:57,280 --> 01:27:59,440
一定很好吃 那是同一块巧克力
It'll be delicious. It's the same bar.

930
01:27:59,620 --> 01:28:02,920
只是在传送的过程中变小了而已
It's just gotten a little smaller on the journey, that's all.

931
01:28:11,260 --> 01:28:12,750
好好吃哦
It's great.

932
01:28:12,930 --> 01:28:14,450
真是奇迹
It's a miracle.

933
01:28:16,100 --> 01:28:19,070
想像你坐在家里看电视...
So imagine, you're sitting at home watching television...

934
01:28:19,240 --> 01:28:22,870
荧幕上突然出现广告的声音说
and suddenly a commercial will flash onto the screen, and a voice will say:

935
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:27,100
旺卡巧克力是全世界最好吃的
"Wonka's chocolates are the best in the world.

936
01:28:27,280 --> 01:28:30,180
不相信的话  自己吃吃看
If you don't believe us, try one for yourself."

937
01:28:31,220 --> 01:28:34,780
这时你只要伸手拿起来吃就好了
And you simply reach out and take it.

938
01:28:35,690 --> 01:28:36,980
怎么样?
How about that?

939
01:28:37,160 --> 01:28:39,090
能不能传送别的东西?
So can you send other things?

940
01:28:39,260 --> 01:28:41,050
比如早餐谷片?
Say, like, breakfast cereal?

941
01:28:41,390 --> 01:28:44,120
你知道早餐谷片是什么做的吗?
Do you have any idea what breakfast cereal's made of?

942
01:28:44,300 --> 01:28:47,560
就是削铅笔机里那些卷卷的木屑
It's those little curly wooden shavings you find in pencil sharpeners.

943
01:28:47,730 --> 01:28:49,760
到底能不能透过电视传送出去?
But could you send it by TV if you wanted to?

944
01:28:50,100 --> 01:28:52,090
-当然可以 -人类呢?
-Of course I could. -What about people?

945
01:28:52,570 --> 01:28:55,940
我传送人类干嘛?  反正又不好吃
Well, why would I wanna send a person? They don't taste very good at all.

946
01:28:56,110 --> 01:28:59,340
你不知道你发明了什么吗?  这是传送器耶
Don't you realize what you've invented? It's a teleporter.

947
01:28:59,640 --> 01:29:02,510
这是有史以来最重要的发明
It's the most important invention in the history of the world.

948
01:29:02,680 --> 01:29:04,840
你却满脑子只想着巧克力
And all you think about is chocolate.

949
01:29:05,020 --> 01:29:06,240
冷静点  麦克
Calm down, Mike.

950
01:29:06,420 --> 01:29:09,180
旺卡先生心里有数
I think Mr. Wonka knows what he's talking about.

951
01:29:09,360 --> 01:29:11,790
才怪  他什么也不知道
No, he doesn't. He has no idea.

952
01:29:11,960 --> 01:29:14,050
你认为他是天才  其实他很白痴
You think he's a genius, but he's an idiot.

953
01:29:14,990 --> 01:29:16,760
但我不是白痴
But I'm not.

954
01:29:21,470 --> 01:29:22,900
小男孩
Hey, little boy.

955
01:29:24,270 --> 01:29:25,960
别按我的按钮
Don't push my button.

956
01:30:07,380 --> 01:30:08,780
他不见了
He's gone.

957
01:30:09,220 --> 01:30:11,740
我们去电视那边看看
Let's go check the television, see what we get.

958
01:30:12,920 --> 01:30:15,320
希望别遗漏了他的哪个部位
I sure hope no part of him gets left behind.

959
01:30:15,490 --> 01:30:16,720
什么意思?
What do you mean?

960
01:30:17,190 --> 01:30:21,590
有时候会只传输了其中的一半
Well, sometimes only half of the little pieces find their way through.

961
01:30:22,760 --> 01:30:26,220
若要你选择 你会选你儿子的哪一半?
If you had to choose only one half of your son, which one would it be?

962
01:30:26,530 --> 01:30:28,430
这是什么鸟问题啊?
What kind of a question is that?

963
01:30:29,240 --> 01:30:32,300
没必要发脾气嘛  只是问问而已
No need to snap. Just a question.

964
01:30:33,140 --> 01:30:36,110
每个频道都看看  我开始担心了
Try every channel. I'm starting to feel a little anxious.

965
01:30:41,750 --> 01:30:43,480
-他在那里  -麦克
-There he is. -Mike.

966
01:30:44,220 --> 01:30:45,910
我们至今学会的...
The most important thing...

967
01:30:46,090 --> 01:30:47,310
最重要的事情
That we've ever learned

968
01:30:47,490 --> 01:30:50,890
与孩子们有关的
The most important thing we've learned As far as children are concerned

969
01:30:51,060 --> 01:30:53,890
就是永远不能让他们走近电视机
Is never, never let them near The television set

970
01:30:54,060 --> 01:30:57,550
最好就是根本没有装那个傻玩意
Or better still just don't install The idiotic thing at all

971
01:30:58,530 --> 01:31:01,230
永远不能让他们...
Never, never let them Never, never let them...

972
01:31:14,320 --> 01:31:15,910
永远不能让他们...
Never, never let them...

973
01:31:16,080 --> 01:31:17,350
永远不能让他们...
Never, never let them...

974
01:31:17,520 --> 01:31:19,320
它腐蚀脑袋
It rots the senses in the head

975
01:31:19,490 --> 01:31:20,680
它把想像力杀掉
It keeps imagination dead

976
01:31:20,860 --> 01:31:22,380
它堵塞人的思想  扰乱人心
It clogs and clutters up the mind

977
01:31:22,560 --> 01:31:24,150
它使小朋友变蠢
It makes a child so dull and blind

978
01:31:24,330 --> 01:31:25,690
好蠢
So dull, so dull

979
01:31:25,860 --> 01:31:28,890
再也不能理解幻想和童话世界
He can no longer understand A fairy tale, a fairyland

980
01:31:29,070 --> 01:31:30,620
童话世界
A fairyland, a fairyland

981
01:31:30,830 --> 01:31:32,230
他的脑子像起司一样软
His brain becomes as soft as cheese

982
01:31:32,400 --> 01:31:33,870
思维能力生锈  凝滞不前
His thinking powers rust and freeze

983
01:31:34,070 --> 01:31:37,300
他不会想  只会看
He cannot think, he only sees

984
01:31:42,110 --> 01:31:45,040
关于麦克·蒂维
Regarding little Mike Teavee

985
01:31:45,210 --> 01:31:47,840
我们感到很抱歉
We very much regret that we

986
01:31:48,420 --> 01:31:50,010
感到很抱歉
Regret that we

987
01:31:51,690 --> 01:31:53,280
我们只好等着看
Shall simply have to wait and see

988
01:31:53,460 --> 01:31:54,750
等着看...
Wait and see, wait and see

989
01:31:54,920 --> 01:31:57,220
等着看...
Wait and see, wait and see, wait and see

990
01:31:57,390 --> 01:31:58,760
我们感到很抱歉
We very much regret that we

991
01:31:58,930 --> 01:32:00,550
只好等着看
Shall simply have to wait and see

992
01:32:00,730 --> 01:32:02,590
他能否恢复原来的高度
If we can get him back his height

993
01:32:02,770 --> 01:32:05,320
如果不能
But if we can't

994
01:32:05,500 --> 01:32:06,520
也是他自作自受
It serves him right

995
01:32:07,040 --> 01:32:08,260
快抓他出来
Somebody grab him.

996
01:32:08,440 --> 01:32:10,270
救救我
Help me.

997
01:32:10,970 --> 01:32:12,530
救救我
Help me.

998
01:32:13,480 --> 01:32:16,570
谢天谢地  他安然无恙
Oh, thank heavens. He's completely unharmed.

999
01:32:16,750 --> 01:32:20,310
安然无恙? 你在胡说什么?
Unharmed? What are you talking about?

1000
01:32:23,150 --> 01:32:25,550
再逆向把我传回去
Just put me back in the other way.

1001
01:32:25,720 --> 01:32:27,280
不能逆向了
There is no other way.

1002
01:32:27,460 --> 01:32:30,480
这是电视  又不是电话 差别很大耶
It's television, not telephone. There's quite a difference.

1003
01:32:30,690 --> 01:32:33,690
你建议我们该怎么做呢?
And what exactly do you propose to do about it?

1004
01:32:33,860 --> 01:32:34,950
我不知道
I don't know.

1005
01:32:35,900 --> 01:32:39,560
但年轻人的弹性极佳 伸展力超好的
But young men are extremely springy. They stretch like mad.

1006
01:32:40,200 --> 01:32:43,300
-把他放进拉太妃糖的机器里 -拉太妃糖的机器?
-Let's go put him in the taffy puller. -Taffy puller?

1007
01:32:43,970 --> 01:32:45,270
那是我想到的
Hey, that was my idea.

1008
01:32:47,410 --> 01:32:48,780
天哪  他会变得很瘦
Boy, is he gonna be skinny.

1009
01:32:49,850 --> 01:32:51,400
是啊
Yeah.

1010
01:32:51,580 --> 01:32:53,850
拉太妃糖的机器
Taffy puller.

1011
01:32:54,750 --> 01:32:57,280
带蒂维先生和他的...
I want you to take Mr. Teavee and his...

1012
01:32:58,660 --> 01:33:01,280
小孩去拉太妃糖的房间
little boy up to the taffy puller, okay?

1013
01:33:01,460 --> 01:33:03,260
把他拉长
Stretch him out.

1014
01:33:14,070 --> 01:33:16,010
继续参观吧
On with the tour.

1015
01:33:24,850 --> 01:33:27,180
还有很多东西要看呢
There's still so much left to see.

1016
01:33:27,350 --> 01:33:29,880
现在剩下几个小朋友?
Now, how many children are left?

1017
01:33:32,590 --> 01:33:36,990
旺卡先生 只剩下查理一个人了
Mr. Wonka, Charlie's the only one left now.

1018
01:33:39,330 --> 01:33:40,730
只剩下你一个人?
You mean, you're the only one?

1019
01:33:41,630 --> 01:33:43,290
对
Yes.

1020
01:33:43,570 --> 01:33:44,860
其他人都怎么了?
What happened to the others?

1021
01:33:49,410 --> 01:33:52,000
亲爱的孩子  这表示你赢了
Oh, my dear boy, but that means you've won.

1022
01:33:52,180 --> 01:33:54,340
恭喜你  我衷心祝贺你
Oh, I do congratulate you. I really do.

1023
01:33:54,510 --> 01:33:55,840
我太高兴了
I'm absolutely delighted.

1024
01:33:56,020 --> 01:33:58,570
我早有预感了  干得好
I had a hunch right from the beginning. Well done.

1025
01:33:58,750 --> 01:34:00,740
现在我们刻不容缓
Now, we mustn't dilly or dally.

1026
01:34:00,920 --> 01:34:03,850
因为在天黑前还有很多事要做
We have an enormous number of things to do before the day's out.

1027
01:34:04,020 --> 01:34:08,080
但幸好有玻璃电梯 可以迅速往来各处...
But luckily for us, we have the great glass elevator to speed things along...

1028
01:34:14,530 --> 01:34:15,830
迅速往来各处
Speed things along.

1029
01:34:18,670 --> 01:34:20,260
走吧
Come on.

1030
01:34:24,950 --> 01:34:26,170
(往上飞出去)

1031
01:34:26,480 --> 01:34:28,780
往上飞出去?  这是什么房间?
"Up and Out"? What kind of room is that?

1032
01:34:29,320 --> 01:34:30,980
站稳了
Hold on.

1033
01:34:39,730 --> 01:34:41,490
我的老天
Oh, my goodness.

1034
01:34:41,660 --> 01:34:45,220
我们速度要更快  否则冲不破
We're gonna need to go much faster, otherwise we'll just never break through.

1035
01:34:45,400 --> 01:34:46,960
冲破什么?
Break through what?

1036
01:34:47,200 --> 01:34:49,630
我多年来一直期待按下那个钮
I've been longing to press that button for years.

1037
01:34:50,370 --> 01:34:53,130
走吧  往上飞出去
Well, here we go. Up and out.

1038
01:34:53,470 --> 01:34:55,870
-但你真的是要...  -没错
-But do you really mean...? -Yeah. I do.

1039
01:34:56,040 --> 01:34:57,530
但这是玻璃做的
But it's made of glass.

1040
01:34:57,710 --> 01:34:59,700
玻璃会碎掉啦
It'll smash into a million pieces.

1041
01:35:35,280 --> 01:35:38,250
奥古塔斯  请别再吃手指头了
Augustus, please don't eat your fingers.

1042
01:35:38,420 --> 01:35:40,280
可是我很好吃耶
But I taste so good.

1043
01:35:53,500 --> 01:35:55,940
妈妈  我现在更灵活了耶
Look, Mother. I'm much more flexible now.

1044
01:35:56,470 --> 01:35:59,000
对  但变成蓝色了
Yes, but you're blue.

1045
01:36:21,460 --> 01:36:24,230
爸爸  我要那种会飞的玻璃电梯
Daddy, I want a flying glass elevator.

1046
01:36:24,900 --> 01:36:28,230
维露卡  你今天只能洗个澡 这样就够了
Veruca, the only thing you're getting today is a bath, and that's final.

1047
01:36:28,400 --> 01:36:30,060
可是人家要嘛
But I want it.

1048
01:36:47,060 --> 01:36:48,920
你住哪里?
Where do you live?

1049
01:36:49,760 --> 01:36:51,920
就在那里  那栋小房子
Right over there. That little house.

1050
01:36:57,270 --> 01:36:59,060
他们几时会回来?
What time do you think they'll be back?

1051
01:36:59,240 --> 01:37:00,860
很难说
Hard to know, dear.

1052
01:37:12,550 --> 01:37:15,180
好像有人敲门耶
I think there's someone at the door.

1053
01:37:15,350 --> 01:37:17,150
妈妈
Hi, Mom.

1054
01:37:19,690 --> 01:37:21,950
妈!  爸!  我们回来了
Mom. Dad. We're back.

1055
01:37:22,130 --> 01:37:23,790
-查理!  -查理!
-Charlie. -Charlie.

1056
01:37:25,160 --> 01:37:26,720
天哪
Goodness.

1057
01:37:28,600 --> 01:37:31,290
这位是威利·旺卡 他送我们回来
This is Willy Wonka. He gave us a ride home.

1058
01:37:31,770 --> 01:37:33,170
我看到了
I see that.

1059
01:37:33,340 --> 01:37:35,330
你们想必就是这孩子的...
You must be the boy's...

1060
01:37:36,640 --> 01:37:39,160
-爸妈?  -对  就是那个
-Parents? -Yeah. That.

1061
01:37:39,340 --> 01:37:42,280
他说查理赢得了大奖
He says Charlie's won something.

1062
01:37:43,720 --> 01:37:45,080
不只是普通的大奖
Not just some something.

1063
01:37:45,420 --> 01:37:49,380
而是有史以来最特别的大奖
The most "something" something of any something that's ever been.

1064
01:37:49,890 --> 01:37:52,720
我要把整座工厂送给这个小男孩
I'm gonna give this little boy my entire factory.

1065
01:37:54,860 --> 01:37:56,920
你一定是在开玩笑吧
You must be joking.

1066
01:37:57,100 --> 01:37:58,390
没有  我是认真的
No, really. It's true.

1067
01:37:58,560 --> 01:38:01,960
几个月前在我半年一次的剪发日...
Because you see, a few months ago, I was having my semiannual haircut...

1068
01:38:02,130 --> 01:38:05,500
我发现了一件怪事
and I had the strangest revelation.

1069
01:38:19,320 --> 01:38:21,150
那根白头发反映出...
In that one silver hair...

1070
01:38:21,320 --> 01:38:23,840
我毕生的心血结晶...
I saw reflected my life's work...

1071
01:38:24,020 --> 01:38:27,420
我的工厂和亲爱的奥柏伦柏人
my factory, my beloved Oompa-Loompas.

1072
01:38:27,590 --> 01:38:30,530
我死了以后谁来照顾他们?
Who would watch over them after I was gone?

1073
01:38:30,700 --> 01:38:32,460
当时才我惊觉
I realized in that moment:

1074
01:38:32,630 --> 01:38:35,120
我一定要找个继承人
I must find a heir.

1075
01:38:36,700 --> 01:38:38,830
我找到了  查理
And I did, Charlie.

1076
01:38:39,010 --> 01:38:40,370
就是你
You.

1077
01:38:42,580 --> 01:38:44,670
所以你才发出那些金奖卷
That's why you sent out the golden tickets.

1078
01:38:46,510 --> 01:38:48,410
奥柏伦柏人是什么?
What are Oompa-Loompas?

1079
01:38:48,580 --> 01:38:50,610
我邀请五个小朋友来参观工厂...
I invited five children to the factory...

1080
01:38:50,780 --> 01:38:53,550
最不讨人厌的就是最后赢家
and the one who was the least rotten would be the winner.

1081
01:38:53,890 --> 01:38:55,320
也就是你  查理
That's you, Charlie.

1082
01:38:55,790 --> 01:38:57,350
你意下如何?
So, what do you say?

1083
01:38:57,520 --> 01:39:01,080
你要不要抛下这一切 搬来工厂跟我住?
Are you ready to leave all this behind and come live with me at the factory?

1084
01:39:01,260 --> 01:39:02,520
好啊
Sure. Of course.

1085
01:39:02,700 --> 01:39:05,360
我家人也可以一起去吧?
I mean, it's all right if my family come too?

1086
01:39:05,530 --> 01:39:07,800
亲爱的  当然不可以
Oh, my dear boy, of course they can't.

1087
01:39:08,700 --> 01:39:10,360
糟老头和臭老太婆成天黏着你...
You can't run a chocolate factory...

1088
01:39:10,540 --> 01:39:13,870
怎么经营巧克力工厂?  我无意冒犯
with a family hanging over you like an old, dead goose. No offense.

1089
01:39:14,070 --> 01:39:15,870
没关系...混蛋
None taken, jerk.

1090
01:39:17,940 --> 01:39:20,430
巧克力制造商要独来独往
A chocolatier has to run free and solo.

1091
01:39:20,610 --> 01:39:23,580
他要追逐梦想  不管后果如何
He has to follow his dreams. Gosh darn the consequences.

1092
01:39:25,090 --> 01:39:26,310
看看我
Look at me.

1093
01:39:26,490 --> 01:39:29,010
我没有家人  却有非凡的成就
I had no family, and I'm a giant success.

1094
01:39:30,390 --> 01:39:34,380
若我搬去工厂和你住 我就再也见不到家人了?
So if I go with you to the factory, I won't ever see my family again?

1095
01:39:34,560 --> 01:39:36,930
对  算你走运
Yeah. Consider that a bonus.

1096
01:39:39,530 --> 01:39:40,760
那我不去了
Then I'm not going.

1097
01:39:41,870 --> 01:39:44,100
我说什么也不抛弃家人
I wouldn't give up my family for anything.

1098
01:39:44,940 --> 01:39:46,840
就算给我再多巧克力也没用
Not for all the chocolate in the world.

1099
01:39:49,380 --> 01:39:51,500
我懂了
Oh, I see.

1100
01:39:53,410 --> 01:39:55,310
很奇怪耶
That's weird.

1101
01:39:58,450 --> 01:40:01,080
还有别种糖果  不只巧克力
There's other candy too besides chocolate.

1102
01:40:02,120 --> 01:40:04,960
对不起  旺卡先生 我要留在这里
I'm sorry, Mr. Wonka. I'm staying here.

1103
01:40:11,800 --> 01:40:13,600
好吧  这...
Well, that's just...

1104
01:40:14,370 --> 01:40:16,340
出乎我意料之外...
unexpected...

1105
01:40:17,910 --> 01:40:19,530
而且很奇怪
and weird.

1106
01:40:26,620 --> 01:40:29,310
但我想既然如此  我就...
But I suppose, in that case, I'll just...

1107
01:40:31,720 --> 01:40:33,020
再见了
Goodbye, then.

1108
01:40:36,130 --> 01:40:37,650
你确定不改变心意?
Sure you won't change your mind?

1109
01:40:40,260 --> 01:40:41,820
我确定
I'm sure.

1110
01:40:51,110 --> 01:40:53,170
好吧  再见
Okay. Bye.

1111
01:41:14,830 --> 01:41:17,800
以后的日子会更好
Things are going to get much better.

1112
01:41:18,470 --> 01:41:24,130
终于有一次 乔治娜婆婆知道自己在说什么了
And for once, Grandma Georgina knew exactly what she was talking about.

1113
01:41:24,940 --> 01:41:29,310
隔天早上查理帮爸妈 修理屋顶上的破洞
The next morning, Charlie helped his parents fix the hole in the roof.

1114
01:41:30,780 --> 01:41:33,840
约瑟夫爷爷不再整天躺在床上
Grandpa Joe spent the whole day out of bed.

1115
01:41:34,020 --> 01:41:35,850
他一点也不觉得累
He didn't feel tired at all.

1116
01:41:37,720 --> 01:41:41,210
查理的父亲在牙膏工厂 找到一份更好的工作...
Charlie's father got a better job at the toothpaste factory...

1117
01:41:41,390 --> 01:41:44,920
修理取代他的机器
repairing the machine that had replaced him.

1118
01:41:46,730 --> 01:41:50,060
巴格特一家人日子过得好极了
Things had never been better for the Bucket family.

1119
01:41:50,400 --> 01:41:53,960
威利·旺卡就没那么好过了
The same could not be said for Willy Wonka.

1120
01:41:54,140 --> 01:41:56,330
我搞不懂
I can't put my finger on it.

1121
01:41:56,810 --> 01:41:59,070
糖果向来是我唯一确定的东西...
Candy's the only thing I was ever certain of...

1122
01:41:59,240 --> 01:42:01,680
现在我却一点也不确定了
and now I'm just not certain at all.

1123
01:42:01,850 --> 01:42:04,640
不知该做什么口味  该试哪个构想
I don't know which flavors to make or which ideas to try.

1124
01:42:04,820 --> 01:42:07,480
我开始怀疑自己  太荒谬了
I'm second-guessing myself, which is nuts.

1125
01:42:08,950 --> 01:42:12,050
我一直是想做什么糖果就做什么 而我...
I've always made whatever candy I felt like, and I...

1126
01:42:18,330 --> 01:42:20,300
就是这样  对吧?
That's just it, isn't it?

1127
01:42:20,470 --> 01:42:24,990
我做了想做的糖果 但我现在很沮丧 这表示糖果也很烂
I make the candy I feel like, but now I feel terrible, so the candy's terrible.

1128
01:42:26,170 --> 01:42:28,760
你很厉害耶
You're very good.

1129
01:42:31,740 --> 01:42:33,070
(灰石咖啡厅)

1130
01:42:40,720 --> 01:42:42,740
那个巧克力商很可怜 叫温多还是华特...
Pity about that chocolate fellow, Wendell...Walter.

1131
01:42:42,920 --> 01:42:43,910
(旺卡销售量大减)

1132
01:42:44,420 --> 01:42:46,450
-威利·旺卡 -就是他
-Willy Wonka. -That's the one.

1133
01:42:47,260 --> 01:42:50,190
报上说他的新糖果卖得不太好
Says here in the paper his new candies aren't selling very well.

1134
01:42:50,800 --> 01:42:54,420
但我想他可能是个坏蛋 这是他活该
But I suppose maybe he's just a rotten egg who deserves it.

1135
01:42:54,600 --> 01:42:57,470
-对啊 -真的吗?
-Yep. -Oh, really?

1136
01:42:57,870 --> 01:42:59,890
你见过他?
You ever met him?

1137
01:43:00,070 --> 01:43:01,700
我见过
I did.

1138
01:43:01,870 --> 01:43:06,570
原本以为他人很好 后来才知道他不是什么好人
I thought he was great at first, but then he didn't turn out so nice.

1139
01:43:07,250 --> 01:43:09,210
而且他的发型很奇怪
He also has a funny haircut.

1140
01:43:09,380 --> 01:43:10,710
才不呢!
I do not!

1141
01:43:11,720 --> 01:43:14,580
-你来干嘛? -我心情不好
-Why are you here? -I don't feel so hot.

1142
01:43:15,150 --> 01:43:17,420
你沮丧时要怎样让心情变好?
What makes you feel better when you feel terrible?

1143
01:43:17,790 --> 01:43:19,220
和家人在一起
My family.

1144
01:43:23,000 --> 01:43:24,760
你对我家人有什么意见?
What do you have against my family?

1145
01:43:25,570 --> 01:43:28,970
不只是你的家人 而是想到...
It's not just your family. It's the whole idea of...

1146
01:43:32,240 --> 01:43:34,260
他们成天规定你可以怎样 不可以怎样...
They tell you what to do, what not to do...

1147
01:43:34,440 --> 01:43:36,910
这样是会扼杀创意的
and it's not conducive to a creative atmosphere.

1148
01:43:37,510 --> 01:43:41,340
他们只是想保护你 因为他们爱你
Usually they're just trying to protect you because they love you.

1149
01:43:43,320 --> 01:43:45,880
不相信就自己去问啊
If you don't believe me, you should ask.

1150
01:43:46,050 --> 01:43:49,020
问谁?  问我爸?
Ask who? My father?

1151
01:43:49,420 --> 01:43:51,080
我才不要
No way.

1152
01:43:52,460 --> 01:43:53,930
至少不要自己去
At least, not by myself.

1153
01:43:54,900 --> 01:43:56,160
你要我陪你去?
You want me to go with you?

1154
01:43:58,330 --> 01:44:02,630
好主意 好啊
Hey. Hey, what a good idea. Yeah!

1155
01:44:05,310 --> 01:44:07,700
而且我还自备交通...
And you know what? I've got transport...

1156
01:44:11,580 --> 01:44:14,880
我得记住玻璃电梯停哪里才行
I have to be more careful where I park this thing.

1157
01:44:45,210 --> 01:44:47,740
好像不是这一家耶
I think we've got the wrong house.

你们有预约吗?
Do you have an appointment?

1160
01:45:04,300 --> 01:45:06,390
没有  但他很久没来了
No. But he's overdue.

1161
01:45:09,710 --> 01:45:11,730
张开嘴巴
Open.

1162
01:45:12,740 --> 01:45:17,640
看看坏了多少牙齿
Now, let's see what the damage is, shall we?

01:45:52,850 --> 01:45:54,110
(工厂开幕了)

1167
01:45:58,220 --> 01:45:59,710
天哪
Heavens.

1168
01:45:59,890 --> 01:46:03,050
我好久没看过这样的牙齿  自从...
I haven't seen bicuspids like these since...

1169
01:46:07,130 --> 01:46:08,930
自从...
Since...

1170
01:46:18,210 --> 01:46:19,470
威利?
Willy?

1171
01:46:21,350 --> 01:46:22,810
嗨  老爸
Hi, Dad.

1172
01:46:33,830 --> 01:46:36,050
这么多年了...
All these years...

1173
01:46:36,830 --> 01:46:38,920
你都没用牙线
and you haven't flossed.

1174
01:46:41,030 --> 01:46:42,860
一次也没有
Not once.

1175
01:47:08,030 --> 01:47:12,160
直到这一天 威利才又向查理提出要求...
It was on this day that Willy Wonka repeated his offer to Charlie...

1176
01:47:12,330 --> 01:47:15,090
查理接受了  可是有一个条件
who accepted on one condition.

1177
01:47:15,270 --> 01:47:17,560
抱歉晚回来了  我们在脑力激荡
Sorry we're late. We were brainstorming.

1178
01:47:17,740 --> 01:47:19,670
都激荡出雷声了
Thought I heard thunder.

1179
01:47:19,840 --> 01:47:23,470
-留下来吃晚饭好吗?  -好啊  麻烦你了
-You staying for dinner, Willy? -Yes, please.

1180
01:47:23,940 --> 01:47:26,040
我来摆餐具
I'll shuffle the plates.

1181
01:47:34,620 --> 01:47:37,920
你身上有花生味
You smell like peanuts.

1182
01:47:38,290 --> 01:47:41,660
-我喜欢花生 -谢谢你
-I love peanuts. -Oh, thank you.

1183
01:47:41,830 --> 01:47:43,490
你身上有...
You smell like...

1184
01:47:43,660 --> 01:47:45,490
老人味  还有肥皂味
old people and soap.

1185
01:47:48,400 --> 01:47:50,030
我喜欢
I like it.

1186
01:47:54,670 --> 01:47:57,200
手肘别撑在桌上  查理
Elbows off the table, Charlie.

1187
01:47:57,380 --> 01:47:59,400
你觉得小覆盆子风筝怎么样?
How do you feel about little raspberry kites?

1188
01:47:59,850 --> 01:48:01,440
用甘草根来代替线
With licorice instead of string.

1189
01:48:02,520 --> 01:48:06,010
-餐桌上不准谈公事 -对不起
-Boys, no business at the dinner table. -Sorry, Mom.

1190
01:48:06,550 --> 01:48:09,580
我觉得你说的没错
I think you're on to something, though, Charlie.

1191
01:48:20,870 --> 01:48:25,740
最后 查理·巴格特得到一家巧克力工厂
In the end, Charlie Bucket won a chocolate factory.

1192
01:48:27,070 --> 01:48:31,810
但威利·旺卡得到了更好的礼物
But Willy Wonka got something even better:

1193
01:48:32,450 --> 01:48:34,910
那就是家人
A family.

1194
01:48:36,250 --> 01:48:40,410
有一件事可以非常确定
And one thing was absolutely certain:

1195
01:48:40,860 --> 01:48:44,850
甜美的人生莫过于此
Life had never been sweeter.
