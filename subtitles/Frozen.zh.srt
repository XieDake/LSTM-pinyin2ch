慢點兒
Slow down!

45
00:05:14,820 --> 00:05:17,280
安娜
Anna!

46
00:05:21,530 --> 00:05:23,240
安娜
Anna?

47
00:05:25,370 --> 00:05:27,620
媽媽  爸爸

00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:43,300
艾爾莎  你幹了什麼  太過分了

52

53
00:06:12,110 --> 00:06:14,160
再快點  斯溫

54
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:17,740
斯溫

00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,750
請幫幫我
Please... Help!

56
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:25,040
我女兒她
My daughter!

57
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:37,680
是國王
He is the King!

58
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:41,510
地精
Trolls...?

59
00:06:41,510 --> 00:06:43,970
安靜  我正聽著呢
Shush. I'm trying to listen.

60
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:47,640
小可愛們  我要把你們都留下
Cuties. I'm gonna keep you.

61
00:06:48,140 --> 00:06:49,850
國王陛下
Your Majesty!

62
00:06:49,850 --> 00:06:52,310
是生來就有還是中了惡咒
Born with the powers or cursed?

63
00:06:52,310 --> 00:06:54,770
生來就有  而且法力越來越強了
Born. And they're getting stronger.

64
00:06:57,690 --> 00:07:00,530
幸好傷到的不是她的心
You are lucky it wasn't her heart.

65
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:03,320
心不容易恢復
The heart is not so easily changed,

66
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,990
頭卻不難治好
but the head can be persuaded.

67
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:07,780
請你盡力
Do what you must.

68
00:07:07,780 --> 00:07:10,620
我建議抹去所有和魔法有關的東西
I recommend we remove all magic,

69
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:14,250
為了保險  有魔法的記憶都不要留
even memories of magic to be safe...

70
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:19,290
但是別擔心  快樂的記憶還在
But don't worry, I'll leave the fun.

71
00:07:23,920 --> 00:07:25,960
她會沒事的
She will be okay.

72
00:07:25,960 --> 00:07:28,920
她不會記得我的魔法嗎
But she won't remember I have powers?

73
00:07:28,920 --> 00:07:31,840
-安全起見  -聽我說  艾爾莎
- It's for the best. - Listen to me, Elsa,

74
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:35,100
你的魔法只會日漸增強
your power will only grow.

75
00:07:35,930 --> 00:07:38,430
雖然是美好的
There is beauty in it...

76
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,220
但也有危險
but also great danger.

77
00:07:42,430 --> 00:07:45,020
你必須學會控制
You must learn to control it.

78
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:48,270
恐懼是你的敵人
Fear will be your enemy.

79
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:54,400
不  我們會保護他  她肯定能學會控制
No. We'll protect her. She can learn to control it. I'm sure.

80
00:07:54,730 --> 00:07:56,400
不過現在
Until then,

81
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:59,740
還是關上城門  遣散僕從
we'll lock the gates. We'll reduce the staff.

82
00:08:00,070 --> 00:08:03,120
儘量減少她與別人的接觸
We will limit her contact with people

83
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:06,160
防止別人知道她的魔法
and keep her powers hidden from everyone...

84
00:08:08,870 --> 00:08:11,170
包括安娜
including Anna.

85
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:23,130
艾爾莎
Elsa?

86
00:08:25,180 --> 00:08:28,350
快來陪我堆雪人嘛
Do you want to build a snowman

87
00:08:28,550 --> 00:08:31,510
我們一起出去玩吧
Come on let's go and play

88
00:08:31,810 --> 00:08:35,310
我再也沒見到你  快出來呀
I never see you anymore. Come out the door

89
00:08:35,310 --> 00:08:38,350
你好像離開我了
It's like you've gone away

90
00:08:38,350 --> 00:08:40,650
我們曾是好夥伴
We used to be best buddies

91
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:45,940
現在你卻不理我  快告訴我為什麼
And now we're not. I wish you would tell me why

92
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:49,530
快來陪我堆雪人嘛
Do you want to build a snowman

93
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:51,530
不堆雪人也可以呀
It doesn't have to be a snowman

94
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:53,570
走吧  安娜
Go away, Anna.

95
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:56,620
好吧  再見
Okay bye

96
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:05,580
戴著手套會有幫助  瞧
The gloves will help. See...

97
00:09:05,580 --> 00:09:08,330
-封閉起來  -不要去感受
- Conceal it. - Don't feel it.

98
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:10,380
別讓人看清
Don't let it show.

99
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:15,840
快來陪我堆雪人嘛
Do you want to build a snowman

100
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:18,640
或是騎車繞大廳跑
Or ride our bike around the hall

101
00:09:19,140 --> 00:09:21,300
好久沒人陪我玩
I think some company is overdue

102
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:24,390
我都只能對畫唱歌了
I've started talking to the pictures on the walls

103
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:25,510
撐住  貞德
Hang in there, Joan.

104
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:29,140
房間這麼空  內心好孤單
It gets a little lonely all these empty rooms

105
00:09:29,140 --> 00:09:32,810
看時光滴答流逝
Just watching the hours tick by

106
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:40,280
我很害怕  魔法越來越強了
I'm scared. It's getting stronger.

107
00:09:40,280 --> 00:09:42,370
害怕只會越來越糟
Getting upset only makes it worse.

108
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:43,280
冷靜下來
Calm down.

109
00:09:43,280 --> 00:09:47,450
不  別碰我  求你了  我不想傷害你
No. Don't touch me. Please. I don't want to hurt you.

110
00:09:55,080 --> 00:09:57,040
我們兩周後見

00:09:59,000 --> 00:10:02,710
-你們一定要走嗎  -你會沒事的  艾爾莎

112
00:10:41,700 --> 00:10:43,490
艾爾莎
Elsa?

113
00:10:43,490 --> 00:10:46,700
求你了  我知道你在裡面
Please, I know you're in there

114
00:10:47,290 --> 00:10:50,120
人們都在打聽你的下落
People are asking where you've been

115
00:10:51,290 --> 00:10:54,710
他們說要勇敢  我也在努力

我就在門外  讓我進來吧

現在只剩你我
We only have each other

118
00:11:02,470 --> 00:11:04,550
我們彼此相依
It's just you and me

119
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,010
我們究竟該怎麼辦
What are we gonna do

120
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:15,600
快來陪我堆雪人嘛
Do you want to build a snowman

121
00:11:39,970 --> 00:11:44,300

-歡迎來到阿倫黛爾  -謝謝您  先生

請小心腳下  城門馬上就會開啟

124
00:11:57,220 --> 00:11:59,010
為什麼我非得穿這個

125

137
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:39,330
我是不是說得太大聲了
Did I just say that out loud?

138
00:12:39,330 --> 00:12:40,960
我已經等不及想看看
Oh, me sore eyes can't wait to

00:13:32,840 --> 00:13:35,380
好久沒有這樣過
I didn't know they did that anymore

156
00:13:35,380 --> 00:13:39,420
誰知道我們有八千個沙拉碟呢
Who knew we owned 8000 salad plates

157
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:42,420
我在這空蕩的大廳漫步多年
For years I have roamed these empty halls

158
00:13:42,420 --> 00:13:44,640
沒有舞會  要舞廳有什麼用
Why have a ballroom with no balls

159
00:13:44,640 --> 00:13:48,810
終於  城門就要開啟了
Finally, they're opening up the gates

160
00:13:49,220 --> 00:13:51,930
都是有血有肉的人
There'll be actual, real-life people

161
00:13:51,930 --> 00:13:54,230
這感覺好奇怪
It'll be totally strange

162
00:13:54,230 --> 00:13:58,230
可我早已準備好了
But wow am I so ready for this change

163
00:13:58,310 --> 00:14:02,940
因為好久以來
'Cause for the first time in forever

164
00:14:03,070 --> 00:14:07,360
會有音樂  伴著燈光
There'll be music, there'll be light

165
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:12,030
因為好久以來
For the first time in forever

166
00:14:12,110 --> 00:14:16,830
我將徹夜翩然起舞
I'll be dancing through the night

167
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:19,120
我不知道是興奮還是得意
Don't know if I'm elated or gassy

168
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:22,210
但總之也差不多
But I'm somewhere in that zone

169
00:14:22,210 --> 00:14:27,590
因為好久以來
'Cause for the first time in forever

170
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:33,340
我將不再孤單  我等不及見到大家
I won't be alone. I can't wait to meet everyone...

171
00:14:34,090 --> 00:14:36,090
如果遇到真命天子呢
What if I meet "The one"?

172
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:39,430
今晚  想像自己禮服加身
Tonight, imagine me gown and all

173
00:14:39,430 --> 00:14:41,720
迷人地斜倚著牆
Fetchingly draped against the wall

174
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:45,970
好一幅精緻優雅的畫面
The picture of sophisticated Grace

175
00:14:46,470 --> 00:14:48,770
驀然回首  看到我的他
I suddenly see him standing there

176
00:14:48,890 --> 00:14:51,310
素未謀面  面容俊朗
a beautiful stranger tall and fair

177
00:14:51,310 --> 00:14:55,610
我只想嘴裡塞滿巧克力
I wanna stuff some chocolate in my face

178
00:14:55,770 --> 00:14:58,280
但我們徹夜暢談歡笑
But then we laugh and talk all evening

179
00:14:58,280 --> 00:15:00,860
說起來也奇怪
Which is totally bizarre

180
00:15:00,860 --> 00:15:04,740
和以前的生活截然不同
Nothing like the life I've led so far

181
00:15:05,110 --> 00:15:09,030
好久好久以來
For the first time in forever

182
00:15:09,530 --> 00:15:13,950
生活中充滿了魔法和歡樂
There'll be magic, there'll be fun

183
00:15:14,290 --> 00:15:18,290
好久好久以來
For the first time in forever

184
00:15:18,580 --> 00:15:23,250
我會受人矚目
I could be noticed by someone

185
00:15:23,380 --> 00:15:25,920
我知道這是瘋言瘋語
And I know it is totally crazy

186
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:29,010
想像自己能找到真愛
To dream I'd find romance

187
00:15:29,010 --> 00:15:34,180
但這是好久以來
But for the first time in forever

188
00:15:35,180 --> 00:15:38,010
至少我有了機會
At least I've got a chance

189
00:15:43,900 --> 00:15:48,230
掩藏好自己  不許人靠近
Don't let them in. Don't let them see

190
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:52,440
乖乖聽話  別讓大家擔心
Be the good girl You always have to be

191
00:15:53,860 --> 00:15:57,320
把真心封閉
Conceal. Don't feel.

192
00:15:57,570 --> 00:15:59,950
演好這齣戲
Put on a show.

193
00:15:59,950 --> 00:16:03,990
走錯一步  就會人盡皆知
Make one wrong move and everyone will know

194
00:16:05,250 --> 00:16:06,790
只是為了今天
But it's only for today

195
00:16:06,790 --> 00:16:07,640
只是為了今天
It's only for today

196
00:16:07,640 --> 00:16:09,210
等待使人心焦
It's agony to wait

197
00:16:09,210 --> 00:16:11,000
等待使人心焦
It's agony to wait

198
00:16:11,000 --> 00:16:14,380
通知守衛打開  城門
Tell the guards to open up the gate

199
00:16:14,380 --> 00:16:17,090
打開城門
The gate

200
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,960
這是好久以來
For the first time in forever

201
00:16:23,220 --> 00:16:26,640
我將獲得夢想的一切
I'm getting what I'm dreaming of.

202
00:16:26,640 --> 00:16:28,760
乖乖聽話  別讓大家擔心
Be the good girl you always have to be.

203
00:16:28,850 --> 00:16:32,350
改變我生活的機會
A chance to change my only world.

204
00:16:32,350 --> 00:16:34,190
把真心封閉
Conceal.

205
00:16:34,600 --> 00:16:37,060
一個獲得真愛的機會
A chance to find true love

206
00:16:37,060 --> 00:16:38,980
把真心封閉  不讓人看清
Conceal. Don't feel, Don't let them know

207
00:16:39,190 --> 00:16:42,150
我知道明天一切將會結束
I know it all ends tomorrow

208
00:16:42,150 --> 00:16:45,070
所以必須抓住今天
So it has to be today

209
00:16:45,280 --> 00:16:50,320
因為這是好久以來
'Cause for the first time in forever

210
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:56,040
好久以來
For the first time in forever

211
00:16:57,450 --> 00:17:02,200
什麼都無法阻止我
Nothing's in my way

212
00:17:07,130 --> 00:17:09,840
我很抱歉  你受傷了嗎
I'm so sorry. Are you hurt?

213
00:17:10,590 --> 00:17:11,210
你好
Hey!

214
00:17:11,590 --> 00:17:15,260
-對  不  我沒事  -真的嗎
- I-ya, no. No. I'm okay. - Are you sure?

215
00:17:15,430 --> 00:17:18,140
沒錯  是我走路不小心
Yeah, I just wasn't looking where I was going.

216
00:17:18,140 --> 00:17:22,390
-但是我真的沒事  -謝天謝地
- But I'm great, actually. - Oh, thank goodness.

217
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:29,730
我是南部群島的漢斯王子
Prince Hans of the Southern Isles.

218
00:17:30,060 --> 00:17:32,900
-我是阿倫黛爾的公主  -公主
- Princess Anna of Arendelle. - Princess...?

219
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:34,690
公主殿下
My Lady.

220
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:39,900
你好啊
Hi... again.

221
00:17:40,320 --> 00:17:41,900
老天
Oh boy.

222
00:17:41,900 --> 00:17:43,910
真尷尬  不是說你
Ha. This is awkward. Not you're awkward,

223
00:17:43,910 --> 00:17:45,990
但是我們  是我很尷尬
but just because we're...I'm awkward.

224
00:17:45,990 --> 00:17:47,450
你好帥  我說啥了
You're gorgeous. Wait, what?

225
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:48,740
我想為騎馬撞到阿倫黛爾的公主殿下
I'd like to formally apologize for

226
00:17:48,740 --> 00:17:51,330
以及之後發生的種種
hitting the Princess of Arendelle with my horse...

227
00:17:51,660 --> 00:17:53,540
向你正式道歉
and for every moment after.

228
00:17:53,540 --> 00:17:56,410
不  沒關係  我並不是那位公主
No. No-no. It's fine. I'm not THAT Princess.

229
00:17:56,410 --> 00:17:59,250
我是說  要是你撞到我姐姐艾爾莎  那可就
I mean, if you'd hit my sister Elsa, that would be...

230
00:17:59,250 --> 00:18:00,750
不好說了
'cuz, you know...

231
00:18:01,420 --> 00:18:02,790
你好
Hello.

232
00:18:02,790 --> 00:18:06,510
但是  幸好  只是我而已
But, lucky you, it's-it's just me.

233
00:18:07,010 --> 00:18:08,630
只是你
Just you?

234
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:17,470
鳴鐘了  是加冕儀式
The bells. The coronation.

235
00:18:17,470 --> 00:18:18,770
我  我
I... I...

236
00:18:18,890 --> 00:18:22,270
我要走了  我必須得走了
I better go. I have to...I better go.

237
00:18:22,690 --> 00:18:24,190
再見
Bye!

238
00:19:09,600 --> 00:19:12,560
陛下  手套
Your Majesty, The gloves.

239
00:19:31,660 --> 00:19:35,080
在此聖地  為您加冕
Sem hon heldr inum helgum eignum ok

240
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:42,540
至尊無上  統禦全境
krýnd í þessum helga stað ek té fram fyrir yðr

241
00:19:42,620 --> 00:19:45,920
阿倫黛爾的女王艾爾莎
Queen Elsa of Arendelle.

242
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:49,130
阿倫黛爾的女王艾爾莎
Queen Elsa of Arendelle.

243
00:20:06,140 --> 00:20:08,770
有請阿倫黛爾的女王艾爾莎
Queen Elsa of Arendelle.

244
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:14,020
有請阿倫黛爾的公主安娜
Princess Anna of Arendelle!

245
00:20:18,230 --> 00:20:22,320
站這兒  你確定  我覺得不該  好吧
Here? Are you sure? I do not think I suppose to...Okay.

246
00:20:30,870 --> 00:20:32,750
你好
Hi.

247
00:20:32,790 --> 00:20:36,120
是在和我說話嗎  你好
Hi me...? Oh. Um. Hi.

248
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:40,590
-你看上去很美  -謝謝
- You look beautiful... -Thank you.

249
00:20:40,670 --> 00:20:42,800
你看上去更圓  不是圓
You look beautifuller. I mean, not fuller.

250
00:20:42,800 --> 00:20:44,800
你一點都不圓  我是說更美
You don't look fuller, but more beautiful.

251
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,800
謝謝
Thank you.

252
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:50,590
宴會就是這個樣子的嗎
So, this is what a party looks like?

253
00:20:51,890 --> 00:20:53,140
比我想像中的要溫馨得多
It's warmer than I thought.

254
00:20:53,140 --> 00:20:56,850
那奇妙的香味是什麼
And what is that amazing smell?

255
00:20:57,220 --> 00:21:00,600
是巧克力
Chocolate.

256
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:07,110
女王陛下  這是猥瑣屯公爵
Your Majesty. The Duke of Weaseltown.

257
00:21:07,110 --> 00:21:08,730
是韋瑟頓  韋瑟頓公爵
Weselton. The Duke of Weselton..

258
00:21:08,730 --> 00:21:10,360
陛下
Your Majesty,

259
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:13,030
作為您最親密的交易夥伴
as your closest partner in trade,

260
00:21:13,030 --> 00:21:14,280
我應該請您跳
it seems only fitting that I offer you

261
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:16,740
加冕後的第一支舞
your first dance as Queen.

262
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:26,460
謝謝  可是我不跳舞
Thank you. Only I don't dance.

263
00:21:26,460 --> 00:21:28,790
但我妹妹可以
But my sister does.

264
00:21:29,710 --> 00:21:31,830
-你真幸運  -我想還是
- Lucky you...- Oh, I don't think...

265
00:21:31,830 --> 00:21:34,590
如果你暈過去  告訴我  我會接住你
If you swoon, let me know, I'll catch you.

266
00:21:34,590 --> 00:21:36,090
抱歉
Sorry.

267
00:21:36,090 --> 00:21:38,760
就像只機敏的孔雀
Like an agile peacock...

268
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:42,670
說起來  城門能開啟真是太好了
Speaking of, so great to have the gates open.

269
00:21:42,840 --> 00:21:45,220
為什麼之前都要關閉呢
Why did they shut them in the first place?

270
00:21:45,220 --> 00:21:47,180
你知道原因嗎
Do you know the reason? Hmm?

271
00:21:47,800 --> 00:21:49,640
我不知道
No. No...

272
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:51,270
好吧  撐住
Oh, all right. Hang on.

273
00:21:51,270 --> 00:21:53,730
我的外號"小北斗星"可不是浪得虛名
They don't call me "The little dipper" for nothing.

274
00:21:53,730 --> 00:21:59,110
就像一隻猴面雞身的動物  我能飛
Like a chicken...with the face of a monkey... I fly.

275
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:02,860
準備好再跳一輪的時候請告訴我  殿下
Let me know when you're ready for another round, My Lady.

276
00:22:04,240 --> 00:22:06,240
他真是精力充沛
Well, he was sprightly.

277
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:08,450
尤其他還穿著高跟鞋
Especially for a man in heels.

278
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:12,700
-你還好嗎  -我從來沒這麼開心過
- Are you okay? - I've never been better.

279
00:22:12,700 --> 00:22:14,870
感覺太棒了
This is so nice.

280
00:22:14,870 --> 00:22:17,450
我希望以後都能像今天這樣
I wish it could be like this all the time.

281
00:22:17,660 --> 00:22:19,460
我也是
Me too...

282
00:22:22,670 --> 00:22:23,790
但是不行
But it can't.

283
00:22:23,790 --> 00:22:26,710
-為什麼  -就是不行
- Why not? If... - It just can't.

284
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,760
那我先走了
Excuse me for a minute.

285
00:22:41,720 --> 00:22:44,020
-幸虧我抓住你了  -漢斯
- Glad I caught you. - Hans!

286
00:22:54,270 --> 00:22:59,860
我一般都是一個人亂跑  抱歉
I often had the whole parlor to myself to slide... Oops. Sorry.

287
00:22:59,990 --> 00:23:02,490
你的身材也很不錯
Your physique helps, I'm sure too.

288
00:23:07,410 --> 00:23:10,120
-這是什麼  -我生來就有這個
- What's this? - I was born with it,

289
00:23:10,120 --> 00:23:12,540
雖然夢裡是被地精親吻過才有的
Although I dreamt I was kissed by a troll.

290
00:23:12,540 --> 00:23:14,000
我很喜歡
I like it.

291
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:16,620
對  所有的一切  你懂的
Yeah, The whole thing! You got it.

292
00:23:17,170 --> 00:23:20,000
等等  你到底有多少個兄弟
Okay wait, wait. So you have how many brothers?

293
00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,170
十二個哥哥
Twelve older brothers.

294
00:23:22,170 --> 00:23:24,670
有兩年他們中的三個
Three of them pretended I was invisible...

295
00:23:24,670 --> 00:23:27,010
完全忽視我的存在
literally... for two years.

296
00:23:27,010 --> 00:23:29,800
-太糟糕了  -哥哥們都這樣
- That's horrible. - It's what brothers do.

297
00:23:29,800 --> 00:23:31,510
姐姐也是
And sisters.

298
00:23:31,510 --> 00:23:33,470
小時候艾爾莎和我非常親密
Elsa and I were really close when we were little.

299
00:23:33,470 --> 00:23:38,060
但後來有一天  她也把我拒之門外
But then, one day she just shut me out, and...

300
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:40,060
我從來不知道原因
And I never knew why.

301
00:23:40,940 --> 00:23:42,560
我永遠不會將你拒之門外
I would never shut you out.

302
00:23:44,810 --> 00:23:47,690
我能說點瘋話嗎
Okay, can I just say something crazy?

303
00:23:47,690 --> 00:23:49,190
我喜歡聽瘋話
I love crazy.

304
00:23:49,190 --> 00:23:53,650
我的生活不過是面前的一扇又一扇門
All my life has been a series of doors in my face

305
00:23:53,820 --> 00:23:56,990
但是突然之間  我撞見了你
And then suddenly I bump into you

306
00:23:56,990 --> 00:23:59,160
我也這麼想  因為
I was thinking the same thing, because like

307
00:23:59,160 --> 00:24:03,290
我窮盡一生只為尋找自我
I've been searching my whole life to find my own place

308
00:24:03,620 --> 00:24:05,750
也許因為這是派對
And maybe it's the party talking

309
00:24:05,750 --> 00:24:07,910
或是巧克力火鍋
Or the chocolate fondue

310
00:24:07,910 --> 00:24:10,040
但和你在一起
But with you

311
00:24:10,040 --> 00:24:11,670
我找到了自我
I found my place

312
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:13,000
看到你的臉
I see your face

313
00:24:13,170 --> 00:24:17,090
這感覺從未有過
And it's nothing like I've ever known before

314
00:24:17,170 --> 00:24:21,130
愛是一扇相互敞開的心門
Love is an open... door

315
00:24:21,930 --> 00:24:26,510
愛是一扇相互敞開的心門
Love is an open... door...door

316
00:24:26,680 --> 00:24:28,600
愛是一扇相互敞開的心門
Love is an open... door

317
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:31,560
和你在一起  和你在一起
With you! With you

318
00:24:31,560 --> 00:24:35,310
愛是一扇相互敞開的心門
Love is an open door

319
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:43,570
-這太瘋狂了  -什麼
- I mean it's crazy. - What?

320
00:24:43,570 --> 00:24:45,690
-我們吃完了對方的  -三明治
- We finish each other's... - Sandwiches!

321
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:47,070
我正想說這個
That's what I was gonna say

322
00:24:47,070 --> 00:24:50,110
我從未遇到過和我如此默契的人
I've never met someone who thinks so much like me

323
00:24:50,110 --> 00:24:51,740
拉鉤  再拉鉤
Jinx... jinx again.

324
00:24:51,740 --> 00:24:56,580
我們心意相通  只有一個原因
Our mental synchronization can have but one explanation

325
00:24:56,740 --> 00:25:00,710
你和我是命中註定
You and I were just meant to be

326
00:25:00,710 --> 00:25:03,330
說再見
Say goodbye

327
00:25:03,330 --> 00:25:06,340
對過去的痛苦
To the pain of the past

328
00:25:06,340 --> 00:25:09,960
我們無需再那樣活
We don't have to feel it anymore

329
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:13,010
愛若開啟的門
Love is an open... door

330
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:19,260
愛若開啟的門
Love is an open door

331
00:25:19,550 --> 00:25:24,470
生命有你更精彩
Life can be so much more...with you... with you

332
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:28,270
愛若開啟的門
Love is an open... door

333
00:25:29,810 --> 00:25:31,690
我能說句瘋狂的話嗎
Can I say something crazy...?

334
00:25:32,150 --> 00:25:34,020
你願意嫁給我嗎
Will you marry me?

335
00:25:34,020 --> 00:25:36,190
我能說句更瘋狂的話嗎
Can I just say something even crazier?

336
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:37,690
我願意
Yes.

337
00:25:42,910 --> 00:25:46,490
借過  不好意思  能借過一下嗎
Oops! Pardon. Sorry. Can we just get around you there?

338
00:25:46,780 --> 00:25:48,790
謝謝  她在那裡
Thank you. Oh, there she is.

339
00:25:48,830 --> 00:25:51,410
艾爾莎  我是說  女王陛下
Elsa! I mean... Queen...

340
00:25:51,410 --> 00:25:54,210
還是我  請允許我介紹
Me again. May I present,

341
00:25:54,210 --> 00:25:56,710
南部群島的漢斯王子
Prince Hans of the Southern Isles.

342
00:25:56,710 --> 00:25:58,540
女王陛下
Your Majesty.

343
00:25:58,540 --> 00:26:01,170
我們希望得到您的祝福
We would like...your blessing...

344
00:26:01,790 --> 00:26:04,130
祝福我們結婚
of... our marriage!

345
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,800
-結婚  -是的
- Marriage...? - Yes!

346
00:26:06,800 --> 00:26:08,220
抱歉  我沒弄明白
I'm sorry, I'm confused.

347
00:26:08,220 --> 00:26:10,390
我們還沒有討論細節
Well, We haven't worked out all the details ourselves.

348
00:26:10,390 --> 00:26:12,220
我們會花幾天時間計畫婚禮
We'll need a few days to plan the ceremony.

349
00:26:12,220 --> 00:26:13,300
當然婚禮上會有湯羹
Of course we'll have soup,

350
00:26:13,300 --> 00:26:14,390
烤肉  冰淇淩  還有...
roast, and ice cream and then...

351
00:26:14,510 --> 00:26:16,100
等等  我們要住在這裡嗎
Wait. Would we live here?

352
00:26:16,100 --> 00:26:17,810
-這裡  -當然了
- Here? - Absolutely!

353
00:26:17,810 --> 00:26:18,480
安娜
Anna...

354
00:26:18,480 --> 00:26:20,770
我們可以邀請你12個哥哥過來一起住
Oh, we can invite all twelve of your brothers to stay with us...

355
00:26:20,770 --> 00:26:22,100
什麼  等等  不  不
What? No, no, no, no, no.

356
00:26:22,100 --> 00:26:23,350
我們有的是房間  也許他們...
Of course we have the room. I don't know. Some of them must...

357
00:26:23,350 --> 00:26:24,610
等等  停一停
Wait. Slow down.

358
00:26:24,690 --> 00:26:26,400
誰的哥哥都不會住在這裡
No one's brothers are staying here.

359
00:26:26,400 --> 00:26:28,070
誰都不會結婚
No one is getting married.

360
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:29,690
你說什麼
Wait, what?

361
00:26:29,690 --> 00:26:32,780
能私下跟你聊幾句嗎
May I talk to you, please. Alone.

362
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:35,030
不  你要說什麼
No. Whatever you have to say, you...

363
00:26:35,030 --> 00:26:36,820
可以當著我倆的面說
you can say to both of us.

364
00:26:37,490 --> 00:26:40,580
好吧  你不能嫁給一個剛認識的人
Fine. You can't marry a man you just met.

365
00:26:40,580 --> 00:26:42,490
當然可以  我們是真愛
You Can if it's true love.

366
00:26:42,490 --> 00:26:44,410
你對真愛瞭解多少
Anna, what do you know about true love?

367
00:26:44,410 --> 00:26:48,000
起碼比你瞭解  你只知道把人拒之門外
More than you. All you know is how to shut people out.

368
00:26:49,330 --> 00:26:52,290
你們想得到我的祝福  我回答是不
You asked for my blessing, but my answer is no.

369
00:26:52,630 --> 00:26:54,840
恕我失陪
Now, excuse me.

370
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,590
女王陛下  容我...
Your Majesty, if I may ease your...

371
00:26:56,590 --> 00:26:58,930
不用說了  請你離開
No, you may not. And I-I think you should go.

372
00:26:59,380 --> 00:27:01,180
宴會結束了  關上大門
The party is over. Close the gates.

373
00:27:01,180 --> 00:27:02,300
遵命  女王陛下
Yes, Your Majesty.

374
00:27:02,300 --> 00:27:03,760
什麼  艾爾莎  不要  等等
What? Elsa, no. No, wait!

375
00:27:03,760 --> 00:27:05,180
把手套還給我
Give me my glove!

376
00:27:05,180 --> 00:27:08,810
艾爾莎  求求你  我無法再這樣生活了
Elsa, please. Please. I can't live like this anymore.

377
00:27:10,390 --> 00:27:11,930
那就離開
Then leave.

378
00:27:17,230 --> 00:27:18,810
我到底怎麼惹到你了
What did I ever do to you?!

379
00:27:18,810 --> 00:27:20,570
夠了  安娜
Enough, Anna.

380
00:27:20,570 --> 00:27:22,320
為什麼  你為什麼把我拒之門外
No. Why? Why do you shut me out?!

381
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:24,150
為什麼把全世界拒之門外
Why do you shut the world out?!

382
00:27:24,150 --> 00:27:25,990
你到底害怕什麼
What are you so afraid of?!

383
00:27:25,990 --> 00:27:28,240
我說了  夠了
I said, enough!

384
00:27:35,830 --> 00:27:38,120
妖術  我就知道
Sorcery. I knew there was

385
00:27:38,120 --> 00:27:40,410
這裡有不可告人的秘密
something dubious going on here.

386
00:27:41,250 --> 00:27:43,080
艾爾莎
Elsa...?

387
00:27:49,380 --> 00:27:51,170
她在那裡
There she is.

388
00:27:54,380 --> 00:27:56,390
女王陛下  女王萬歲
Your Majesty! Long live the Queen! Queen Elsa...

389
00:27:56,390 --> 00:27:58,350
與我們喝一杯吧
Come drink with us.

390
00:27:58,430 --> 00:28:00,350
艾爾莎女王
Queen Elsa.

391
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:05,730
女王陛下  你沒事吧
Your Majesty? Are you all right?

392
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:18,360
她在那裡  攔住她
There she is! Stop her!

393
00:28:18,360 --> 00:28:19,860
拜託  別靠近我
Please, just stay away from me.

394
00:28:19,860 --> 00:28:21,360
離我遠點
Stay away!

395
00:28:23,870 --> 00:28:26,410
怪物  怪物
Monster... Monster!

396
00:28:33,790 --> 00:28:35,920
艾爾莎
Elsa!

397
00:28:41,000 --> 00:28:42,840
艾爾莎
Elsa...

398
00:28:48,180 --> 00:28:50,180
等等  求你
Wait, Please!

399
00:29:02,150 --> 00:29:04,060
艾爾莎  停下
Elsa, Stop!

400
00:29:04,060 --> 00:29:05,900
-安娜  -不要走
- Anna! - No.

401
00:29:11,860 --> 00:29:14,150
海灣
The Fjord.

402
00:29:32,000 --> 00:29:34,170
雪
Snow?

403
00:29:34,340 --> 00:29:35,340
是雪
Yes, snow!

404
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:37,340
-你還好嗎  -不好
- Are you all right? - No.

405
00:29:37,510 --> 00:29:40,550
-你之前知道嗎  -不知道
- Did you know? - No.

406
00:29:41,090 --> 00:29:42,850
看  下雪了  下雪了
Look! It's snowing! It's snowing!

407
00:29:42,850 --> 00:29:44,550
這個地方被女王詛咒了
The Queen has cursed this land!

408
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:46,260
我們一定要阻止她
She must be stopped!

409
00:29:46,260 --> 00:29:48,220
-你們得把她抓回來  -等等  不要
- You have to go after her...- Wait, no!

410
00:29:48,470 --> 00:29:50,480
你  你也會妖術嗎
You! Is there sorcery in you, too?

411
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,520
你也是怪物嗎
Are you a monster, too?

412
00:29:52,640 --> 00:29:55,560
不  不  我是很普通的人
No. No. I'm completely ordinary.

413
00:29:55,560 --> 00:29:57,560
沒錯  她很普通
That's right she is.

414
00:29:57,810 --> 00:29:59,570
我是說正常
In the best way.

415
00:29:59,650 --> 00:30:01,320
我姐姐不是怪物
And my sister's not a monster.

416
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:02,990
她差點殺死我
She nearly killed me.

417
00:30:03,070 --> 00:30:04,530
-你自己滑倒在冰上的  -她變出的冰
- You slipped on ice... - Her ice!

418
00:30:04,650 --> 00:30:07,200
那是意外  她嚇壞了
It was an accident. She was scared.

419
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,280
她不是故意的  她不是有意做這些的
She didn't mean it. She didn't mean any of this...

420
00:30:10,280 --> 00:30:12,530
今晚的事是我的責任  是我逼的她
Tonight was my fault. I pushed her.

421
00:30:12,530 --> 00:30:15,530
-所以該由我去把她找回來  -什麼
- So I'm the one that needs to go after her. - What?

422
00:30:15,530 --> 00:30:17,160
-沒錯  -把我的馬牽過來
- Yeah. - Bring me my horse, please.

423
00:30:17,160 --> 00:30:19,370
安娜  這太危險了
Anna, no. It's too dangerous.

424
00:30:19,660 --> 00:30:21,370
艾爾莎不危險
Elsa's not dangerous.

425
00:30:21,540 --> 00:30:23,460
我會把她找回來  讓這裡恢復正常
I'll bring her back, And I'll make this right.

426
00:30:23,460 --> 00:30:25,210
-我跟你一起去  -不要
- I'm coming with you...- No.

427
00:30:25,210 --> 00:30:28,000
我需要你留下幫我照看阿倫黛爾
I need you here to take care of Arendelle.

428
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:30,010
願盡綿薄之力
On my honor.

429
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:34,590
我委託漢斯王子管理這裡
I leave Prince Hans in charge!

430
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:37,470
你確定能信任她嗎
Are you sure you can trust her?

431
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,510
我不希望你受到傷害
I don't want you getting hurt.

432
00:30:39,510 --> 00:30:41,350
她是我姐姐
She's my sister,

433
00:30:41,350 --> 00:30:43,350
她絕不會傷害我的
She would never hurt me.

434
00:31:23,840 --> 00:31:26,930
皚皚白雪覆蓋今夜的山
The snow glows white on the mountain tonight

435
00:31:27,050 --> 00:31:30,510
埋藏身後我的足跡
Not a footprint to be seen

436
00:31:30,760 --> 00:31:33,850
在這孤獨白色國度
A kingdom of isolation

437
00:31:34,010 --> 00:31:37,310
我就是那冰雪的女王
And it looks like I'm the Queen

438
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:44,400
狂風呼號  內心亦湧動不能平息
The wind is howling like this swirling storm inside

439
00:31:45,440 --> 00:31:50,400
不管多努力  再無法藏匿
Couldn't keep it in, Heaven knows I tried

440
00:31:52,320 --> 00:31:55,870
掩藏好自己  不許人靠近
Don't let them in, Don't let them see

441
00:31:55,870 --> 00:31:59,370
乖乖聽話  別讓大家擔心
Be the good girl you always have to be

442
00:31:59,370 --> 00:32:04,040
把真心封閉  不讓人看清
Conceal, Don't feel, Don't let them know

443
00:32:05,500 --> 00:32:08,580
如今被看清
Well, Now they know

444
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:12,550
不再躲  不再怕
Let it go. Let it go

445
00:32:12,550 --> 00:32:16,050
秘密已經大白於天下
Can't hold it back anymore

446
00:32:16,050 --> 00:32:19,420
不管他  不害怕
Let it go. Let it go

447
00:32:19,420 --> 00:32:23,140
告別過去不留一絲牽掛
Turn away and slam the door

448
00:32:23,640 --> 00:32:29,180
別人的話  何必在乎它
I don't care what they're going to say

449
00:32:30,140 --> 00:32:33,770
就讓狂風怒號
Let the storm rage on

450
00:32:34,100 --> 00:32:37,560
冰封千里我也從不害怕
The cold never bothered me anyway

451
00:32:41,400 --> 00:32:47,160
現在回首遙望從前  往事變得微不足道
It's funny how some distance makes everything seem small

452
00:32:47,700 --> 00:32:51,160
曾經桎梏我的恐懼
And the fears that once controlled me

453
00:32:51,160 --> 00:32:55,540
也都遠的看不到
Can't get to me at all

454
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:59,080
展現自己  拿出本領
It's time to see what I can do

455
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:02,630
衝破極限  讓自己也吃驚
To test the limits and break through

456
00:33:02,630 --> 00:33:06,840
沒有羈絆  扔掉規矩
No right, No wrong, No rules for me

457
00:33:06,840 --> 00:33:09,210
世界由我
I'm free!

458
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:13,840
放寬心  向前進
Let it go! Let it go!

459
00:33:13,840 --> 00:33:17,390
乘著風  融化在天際
I am one with the wind and sky

460
00:33:17,390 --> 00:33:20,970
向前沖  不後悔
Let it go! Let it go!

461
00:33:20,970 --> 00:33:24,480
我再沒有眼淚
You'll never see me cry

462
00:33:24,980 --> 00:33:28,350
站在這裡
Here I stand and

463
00:33:28,350 --> 00:33:31,650
堅定不移
Here I'll stay

464
00:33:31,650 --> 00:33:35,400
任那狂風怒號
Let the storm rage on

465
00:33:43,360 --> 00:33:49,250
雪花漫天飄下  這是我的魔法
My power flurries through the air into the ground

466
00:33:50,410 --> 00:33:56,330
冰片旋轉紛飛  是我的靈魂在昇華
My soul is spiraling in frozen fractals all around

467
00:33:57,250 --> 00:34:03,260
思緒結晶成冰淩  是冰雪的爆炸
And one thought crystallizes like an icy blast

468
00:34:03,920 --> 00:34:06,800
過去已是過去
I'm never going back

469
00:34:06,800 --> 00:34:11,510
是再也回不去
The past is in the past

470
00:34:11,510 --> 00:34:15,180
不沉溺  不在意
Let it go! Let it go!

471
00:34:15,180 --> 00:34:18,770
如晨曦一般冉冉升起
And I'll rise like the break of dawn

472
00:34:18,770 --> 00:34:22,270
算了吧  忘了吧
Let it go! Let it go!

473
00:34:22,270 --> 00:34:26,070
別指望我回到過去
That perfect girl is gone

474
00:34:26,480 --> 00:34:32,150
站在這裡  不再藏匿
Here I stand in the light of day

475
00:34:34,700 --> 00:34:39,700
任那狂風怒號
Let the storm rage on!

476
00:34:40,450 --> 00:34:43,870
冰封千里我也從不害怕
The cold never bothered me anyway

477
00:34:49,170 --> 00:34:53,170
艾爾莎  艾爾莎
Elsa! Elsa!

478
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,760
艾爾莎  是我安娜
Elsa, It's me, Anna...

479
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:00,840
老妹我不是故意讓你冰封夏天的
Your sister who didn't mean to make you freeze the summer.

480
00:35:01,300 --> 00:35:04,600
對不起  都是我的錯
I'm sorry. It's all my f-f-fault.

481
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:08,560
當然  如果她對我坦誠點
Of course, none of this would have happened

482
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:10,520
也不會發生這樣的事兒
if she'd just told me her secret... ha...

483
00:35:10,730 --> 00:35:13,060
她這個傢伙
She's a stinker.

484
00:35:17,860 --> 00:35:20,320
不不不不  回來  不要跑
Oh no. No. No. No. Come back. No.

485
00:35:21,360 --> 00:35:23,690
好吧
Oooo-Kay.

486
00:35:28,990 --> 00:35:31,780
雪  幹嘛一定是雪
Snow, it had to be snow,

487
00:35:31,780 --> 00:35:34,790
她就不能擁有熱帶魔法
She couldn't have had tr-tr-tropical magic

488
00:35:34,790 --> 00:35:38,660
變出細細白沙和暖暖的...
that covered the f-f-fjords in white sand and warm...

489
00:35:39,660 --> 00:35:41,330
火
Fire!

490
00:36:05,770 --> 00:36:08,770
旅人歐肯的交易站
Wandering Oaken's Trading Post.

491
00:36:09,020 --> 00:36:10,770

00:36:28,000 --> 00:36:30,450
眼下而言  有靴子賣嗎
For now, how about boots,

497
00:36:30,450 --> 00:36:32,870
有冬靴和衣服嗎
Winter boots... and dresses?

498
00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:35,330
那些在冬季用品區
That would be in our winter department.

499
00:36:39,670 --> 00:36:43,840
打聽一下  有沒有別的年輕女子
Oh. Um, I was just wondering, has another young woman,

500
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:47,180
比如女王之類的路過這裡
The Queen perhaps, I don't know, passed through here?

501
00:36:47,180 --> 00:36:50,430
這種暴雪天氣只有你這麼神經會跑出來  親
Only one crazy enough to be out in this storm is you, dear.

502
00:36:57,230 --> 00:36:58,940
還有這個傢伙
You and this fellow... Hoo hoo.

夏季大促銷
Big summer blow out.

00:37:08,940 --> 00:37:10,690
在你身後
Behind you.

506
00:37:10,690 --> 00:37:13,320
哦  對不起
Oh, right. Excuse me.

507
00:37:13,820 --> 00:37:16,530
真是七月飄雪啊
A real howler in July, yes?

508
00:37:16,530 --> 00:37:18,370
這是從哪裡來的冷空氣
Where ever could it be coming from?

509
00:37:19,120 --> 00:37:20,910
北山那邊
The North Mountain.

510
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:22,540
北山
North Mountain.

511
00:37:22,870 --> 00:37:24,460
一共40塊
That'll be forty.

512
00:37:24,460 --> 00:37:26,000
40塊  不行  10塊成交
Forty? No, ten.

513
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:27,630
不行呦  親  
Oh dear, that's no good. See.

514
00:37:27,630 --> 00:37:29,290
這是冬季庫存商品
These are from our winter stock,

515
00:37:29,290 --> 00:37:31,290
現在供應量和需求量極度不平衡
where supply and demand have a big problem.

516
00:37:31,290 --> 00:37:33,590
你跟我說供求的問題
You want to talk about a supply and demand problem?

517
00:37:33,590 --> 00:37:35,260
我以賣冰塊為生
I sell ice for a living.

518
00:37:35,260 --> 00:37:37,220
那現在你的生意可夠難做的
Ooh, that's a rough business to be in right now.

519
00:37:37,220 --> 00:37:39,180
我是說  真是...
I mean, that is really...

520
00:37:39,510 --> 00:37:40,840
真是不走運
Ahem. That's unfortunate.

521
00:37:40,840 --> 00:37:42,720
40塊不能少  但可以贈送你
Still forty. But I will throw in a

522
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,560
一次歐肯獨家桑拿浴
visit to Oaken's sauna.

523
00:37:45,470 --> 00:37:46,850
嗨  親愛的們
Hi, family.

524
00:37:48,510 --> 00:37:51,230
我只有10塊  通融一下
Ten's all I got. Help me out.

525
00:37:51,230 --> 00:37:53,850
那胡蘿蔔賣給你  不能再便宜了
Ten will get you this and no more.

526
00:37:53,940 --> 00:37:55,080
我就問一件事
Okay, just tell me one thing...

527
00:37:55,090 --> 00:37:57,150
北山那邊到底發生了什麼
What was happening on the North Mountain?

528
00:37:57,150 --> 00:37:59,150
看起來像魔法嗎
Did it seem magical?

529
00:38:00,070 --> 00:38:02,490
是的  麻煩讓開
Yes! Now, back up

530
00:38:02,490 --> 00:38:04,400
讓我收拾這個奸商
while I deal with this crook here.

531
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:09,490
你叫我什麼
What did you call me?

532
00:38:09,870 --> 00:38:12,120
好吧  好吧  疼
Okay. Okay, I'm-Ow! Whoa!

533
00:38:12,700 --> 00:38:14,660
回見了您勒
Bye bye.

534
00:38:19,040 --> 00:38:21,790
斯溫  我沒買到你的胡蘿蔔
No Sven, I didn't get your carrots.

535
00:38:22,580 --> 00:38:24,840
但我找到了過夜的地方
But I did find us a place to sleep.

536
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:26,840
還是免費的
And it's free.

537
00:38:28,010 --> 00:38:29,760
很抱歉剛才的暴力行為
I'm sorry about this violence.

538
00:38:29,760 --> 00:38:31,510
我另送你一瓶醃鱈魚
I will add a quart of lutefisk,

539
00:38:31,510 --> 00:38:33,300
彌補剛才的不愉快
so we'll have good feelings.

540
00:38:33,300 --> 00:38:35,470
只要外套和靴子嗎
Just the outfit and boots, yah?

541
00:38:45,890 --> 00:38:49,520
馴鹿比人類善良
Reindeers are better than people

542
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:53,110
斯溫  你說是不是
Sven, don't you think that's true

543
00:38:53,110 --> 00:38:56,400
沒錯  人類會揍你  罵你  騙你
Yeah, people will beat you and curse you and cheat you

544
00:38:56,400 --> 00:38:59,200
除了你  其他人很壞
Every one of em's bad, except you

545
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:01,200
謝謝你  老兄
Oh, Thanks, buddy.

546
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:04,530
但人類比馴鹿更好聞
But people smell better than reindeers

547
00:39:04,620 --> 00:39:08,540
斯溫  你說對不對
Sven, don't you think I'm right

548
00:39:08,540 --> 00:39:12,500
說得沒錯  但你可不香
That's once again true, for all Except you

549
00:39:12,500 --> 00:39:15,580
被你說中了  讓我們休息吧
You got me, let's call it a night

550
00:39:15,830 --> 00:39:18,050
晚安
Good night

551
00:39:18,050 --> 00:39:25,170
小心不要被凍壞
Don't let the frostbite bite

552
00:39:25,420 --> 00:39:27,180
不錯的二重唱
Nice duet.

553
00:39:27,630 --> 00:39:28,550
是你啊
Oh, it's just you.

554
00:39:28,840 --> 00:39:30,470
你想怎麼樣
What do you want?

555
00:39:30,470 --> 00:39:32,930
我想讓你帶我去北山
I want you to take me up the North Mountain.

556
00:39:35,810 --> 00:39:38,190
我不做嚮導的
I don't take people places.

557
00:39:38,270 --> 00:39:39,810
我重說一遍吧
Let me rephrase that...

558
00:39:42,100 --> 00:39:43,610
帶我去北山
Take me up the North Mountain...

559
00:39:43,610 --> 00:39:45,110
拜託你
Please.

560
00:39:51,240 --> 00:39:53,320
我知道如何停止寒冬
Look, I know how to stop this winter.

561
00:39:55,820 --> 00:39:57,370
我們明早出發
We leave at dawn...

562
00:39:57,740 --> 00:40:00,080
而且你忘了斯溫的胡蘿蔔
And you forgot the carrots for Sven.

563
00:40:01,580 --> 00:40:03,700
抱歉  抱歉  我不是故意的
Oops. Sorry. Sorry. I'm sorry. I didn't...

564
00:40:04,830 --> 00:40:07,790
我們現在就走  馬上走
We leave now. Right now.

565
00:40:19,430 --> 00:40:21,510
抓牢  我們要加速了
Hang on! We like to go fast!

566
00:40:21,800 --> 00:40:22,550
我喜歡加速
I like fast!

567
00:40:22,550 --> 00:40:25,810
喂喂  放下你的腳  剛刷的漆
Whoa, whoa! Get your feet down. This is fresh lacquer.

568
00:40:25,810 --> 00:40:27,560
說真的  你是鄉下長大的嗎
Seriously, were you raised in a barn?

569
00:40:28,890 --> 00:40:31,680
不  我在城堡裡長大的
Ew. No, I was raised in a castle.

570
00:40:33,100 --> 00:40:36,810
跟我說說  女王發了什麼瘋要冰封一切
So tell me, what made the Queen go all ice-crazy?

571
00:40:36,810 --> 00:40:39,980
這個嘛  都是我的錯
Oh well, it was all my fault.

572
00:40:39,980 --> 00:40:42,440
我訂了婚  她很不高興
I got engaged but then she freaked out because...

573
00:40:42,440 --> 00:40:44,780
因為那個人是我那天剛認識的
I'd only just met him, you know, that day.

574
00:40:44,780 --> 00:40:46,780
她說  她不會祝福我們的婚姻
And she said she wouldn't bless the marriage...

575
00:40:46,780 --> 00:40:50,620
等等  你跟一個剛認識的人訂婚
Wait. You got engaged to someone you just met?

576
00:40:50,620 --> 00:40:53,240
是  反正我生氣了  她也生氣了
Yeah. Anyway, I got mad and so she got mad.

577
00:40:53,240 --> 00:40:54,500
她打算離開
And then she tried to walk away,

578
00:40:54,500 --> 00:40:55,790
我一把抓下了她的手套
and I grabbed her glove...

579
00:40:55,790 --> 00:40:57,540
等等  你是認真的嗎
Hang on. You mean to tell me.

580
00:40:57,540 --> 00:41:01,920
你跟一個剛認識的人訂了婚
You got engaged to someone you just met?!

581
00:41:01,920 --> 00:41:04,130
是的  專心聽  但事實上
Yes. Pay attention. But the thing is...

582
00:41:04,130 --> 00:41:06,340
她一直帶著手套
she wore the gloves all the time,

583
00:41:06,340 --> 00:41:08,460
我一直以為她只是有潔癖
So I just thought, maybe she has a thing about dirt.

584
00:41:08,590 --> 00:41:12,090
你父母沒告訴過你小心陌生人嗎
Didn't your parents ever warn you about strangers?

585
00:41:12,590 --> 00:41:14,510
他們說過
Yes, they did...

586
00:41:14,680 --> 00:41:17,100
但漢斯不是陌生人
But Hans is not a stranger.

587
00:41:17,100 --> 00:41:19,470
是嗎  他姓什麼
Oh yeah? What's his last name?

588
00:41:19,760 --> 00:41:21,640
姓南部群島吧
...Of-the-Southern-Isles?

589
00:41:21,640 --> 00:41:23,100
-他最喜歡吃是什麼  -三明治

590
00:41:23,100 --> 00:41:24,560
-最好的朋友是誰  -可能叫約翰吧

591
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:25,770
-眼睛的顏色  -夢幻般的顏色
- Eye color... - Dreamy.

592
00:41:25,770 --> 00:41:27,400
-穿多大碼的鞋  -鞋碼很重要嗎
- Foot size? - Foot size doesn't matter.

593
00:41:27,400 --> 00:41:28,730
你跟他一起吃過飯嗎
Have you had a meal with him yet?

594
00:41:28,730 --> 00:41:30,110
如果你討厭他吃飯的樣子呢
What if you hate the way he eats?

595
00:41:30,110 --> 00:41:31,820
如果你討厭他挖鼻屎呢
What if you hate the way he picks his nose?

596
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:33,020
挖鼻屎
Picks his nose?

597
00:41:33,020 --> 00:41:34,110
然後吃掉
And eats it.

598
00:41:34,110 --> 00:41:36,780
拜託  閣下  他是王子
Excuse me, sir. He's a Prince.

599
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:38,780
所有男人都這麼幹
All men do it.

600
00:41:39,860 --> 00:41:42,700
這都不重要  我們是真愛
Ew. Look it doesn't matter, it's true love.

601
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:44,790
聽起來不像真愛
Doesn't sound like true love.

602
00:41:44,790 --> 00:41:46,830
難道你是傳說中的愛情專家嗎
Are you some sort of love expert?

603
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:50,000
不是  但我朋友是
No. But I have friends who are.

604
00:41:50,160 --> 00:41:52,330
你有朋友是愛情專家
You have friends who are love experts?

605
00:41:52,370 --> 00:41:54,460
-我不信  -別說話
- I'm not buying it... - Stop talking.

606
00:41:54,500 --> 00:41:55,960
不  不  我很樂意見見...
No, no, no. I'd like to meet these...

607
00:41:55,960 --> 00:41:57,460
別說話  不是開玩笑
No, I mean it.

608
00:41:58,500 --> 00:41:59,340
噓
Shhh.

609
00:42:12,010 --> 00:42:13,850
斯溫  快跑  快跑
Sven, go. Go!

610
00:42:15,140 --> 00:42:16,440
-那是什麼  -狼
- What are they? - Wolves.

611
00:42:16,520 --> 00:42:17,350
狼
Wolves?

612
00:42:20,190 --> 00:42:21,730
-我們該怎麼辦  -我來對付它們
- What do we do? - I've got this.

613
00:42:21,730 --> 00:42:23,980
你坐好別掉下去  確保自己別被吃掉
You just... don't fall off and don't get eaten.

614
00:42:23,980 --> 00:42:25,480
-但我想幫忙  -不行
- But I wanna help... - No.

615
00:42:25,480 --> 00:42:26,040
為什麼不行
Why not?

616
00:42:26,040 --> 00:42:27,230
因為我不相信你的判斷力
Because I don't trust your judgment.

617
00:42:27,230 --> 00:42:28,690
你說什麼
Excuse me?!

618
00:42:28,780 --> 00:42:30,360
誰會嫁給一個剛認識的陌生人
Who marries a man she just met?

619
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:32,110
我們是真愛
It's true love!

620
00:42:34,450 --> 00:42:36,160
克裡斯托佛
Christopher!

621
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:37,830
是克裡斯托夫
It's Kristoff!

622
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:43,580
低頭
Duck!

623
00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:49,880
-你差點把我點著  -但我沒有
- You almost set me on fire! - But I didn't.

624
00:42:56,550 --> 00:42:57,920
準備跳  斯溫
Get ready to jump, Sven!

625
00:42:57,920 --> 00:42:59,300
不需要你指揮它
You don't tell him what to do!

626
00:43:00,010 --> 00:43:02,760
我說的算  跳  斯溫
I do! Jump, Sven!

627
00:43:17,610 --> 00:43:19,780
我才還清貸款
But I just paid it off.

628
00:43:20,110 --> 00:43:24,400
不  不  不  不
Uh-oh. No, no, no.

629
00:43:24,570 --> 00:43:26,240
抓住
Grab on!

630
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:28,240
拉  斯溫  使勁拉
Pull, Sven! Pull!

631
00:43:39,370 --> 00:43:42,830
我會賠償你的雪橇和所有損失
I'll replace your sled and everything in it.

632
00:43:44,550 --> 00:43:48,460
如果你不想幫忙了  我完全理解
And I understand if you don't want to help me anymore.

633
00:43:53,890 --> 00:43:55,970
我當然不想再幫她了
Of course I don't want to help her anymore.

634
00:43:55,970 --> 00:43:58,310
這事兒讓我再也不想
In fact, this whole thing has ruined me

635
00:43:58,310 --> 00:44:00,640
幫助任何人了
for helping anyone ever again.

636
00:44:01,140 --> 00:44:04,730
-她自己會死掉的  -死就死吧
- But she'll die on her own. - I can live with that.

637
00:44:05,270 --> 00:44:09,520
但如果她死了  就沒人賠你雪橇了
But you won't get your new sled if she's dead.

638
00:44:10,110 --> 00:44:11,860
有時候你還真討厭
You know sometimes I really don't like you.

639
00:44:12,110 --> 00:44:14,240
等等  我們來了
Hold up. We're coming.

640
00:44:14,530 --> 00:44:15,490
真的嗎
You are?!

641
00:44:15,650 --> 00:44:19,570
我是說  我可以讓你跟著
I mean, sure. I'll let you tag along.

642
00:44:29,710 --> 00:44:33,630
-阿倫黛爾  -完全被冰雪覆蓋了
- Arendelle... - It's completely frozen.

643
00:44:35,710 --> 00:44:38,420
沒有關係  艾爾莎會解凍一切的
But it'll be fine. Elsa will thaw it.

644
00:44:38,420 --> 00:44:40,460
-她會嗎  -當然
- Will she? - Yeah.

645
00:44:40,460 --> 00:44:42,840
我們走吧  北山是往這邊走嗎
Now come on. This way to the North Mountain?

646
00:44:44,430 --> 00:44:47,090
準確的說是往那邊走
More like this way.

647
00:45:18,620 --> 00:45:22,450
我從不知道冬天能如此美麗
I never knew winter could be so beautiful.

648
00:45:23,290 --> 00:45:26,710
是的  真的很美  是不是
Yeah... It really is beautiful, isn't it?

649
00:45:26,880 --> 00:45:28,920
但太潔白了
But it's so white.

650
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:30,630
弄點顏色如何
You know, how about a little color?

651
00:45:30,630 --> 00:45:34,170
我覺得深紅色  黃綠色不錯
I'm thinking like maybe some crimson, chartreuse...

652
00:45:34,170 --> 00:45:36,970
黃色如何  不行  不要黃色
How 'bout yellow...no, not yellow.

653
00:45:36,970 --> 00:45:39,680
黃色  白雪  太不搭了
Yellow and snow? Brrrr... no go.

654
00:45:43,260 --> 00:45:45,180
我說的對嗎
Am I right?

655
00:45:45,180 --> 00:45:46,560
-你好  -你有點恐怖
- Hi! - You're creepy.

656
00:45:46,890 --> 00:45:48,560
-我才不要  -別扔給我
- I don't want it! - Backatchya!

657
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:50,230
請別把我掉到地上  拜託  只是個腦袋
Please don't drop me. Come on, it's just a head.

658
00:45:50,230 --> 00:45:50,870
不要給我
No!

659
00:45:50,870 --> 00:45:52,230
看來這個初次見面不算美好
All right, we got off to a bad start.

660
00:45:52,230 --> 00:45:54,190
他的身子
Ew, ew, the body!

661
00:45:57,320 --> 00:45:58,780
等等  我眼前這些是什麼
Wait, what am I looking at right now?

662
00:45:58,780 --> 00:46:00,650
為什麼你們跟蝙蝠一樣倒掛著
Why are you hanging off the earth like a bat?

663
00:46:01,650 --> 00:46:03,740
好吧  等一下
...Al'right. Wait one second.

664
00:46:05,030 --> 00:46:07,620
-謝謝你  -不客氣
- Oooh! Thank you! - You're welcome.

665
00:46:07,620 --> 00:46:09,950
現在我帥呆了
Now I'm perfect.

666
00:46:09,950 --> 00:46:11,370
差不多了
Well, almost.

667
00:46:11,370 --> 00:46:13,370
好像整個世界都顛倒了
It was like my whole life got upside down.

668
00:46:14,450 --> 00:46:16,000
太用力了  抱歉  我只是...
Oh! Too hard. I'm sorry! I was just...

669
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:17,540
-頭暈  -你沒事兒吧
- Woo! Head Rush! - Are you okay?

670
00:46:17,540 --> 00:46:21,000
開什麼玩笑  我感覺好極了
Are you kidding me? I am wonderful!

671
00:46:21,000 --> 00:46:22,750
我一直想要個鼻子
I've always wanted a nose.

672
00:46:22,750 --> 00:46:26,000
太可愛了  就像小小的獨角獸
So cute. It's like a little baby unicorn.

673
00:46:26,000 --> 00:46:28,130
怎麼啦
What? Hey! Whoa.

674
00:46:28,130 --> 00:46:30,300
這樣更棒了
Oh, I love it even more! Hah...

675
00:46:31,090 --> 00:46:33,340
讓我們重新認識一下
All right, let's start this thing over.

676
00:46:33,390 --> 00:46:37,930
各位好  我叫奧洛夫  來個熱情的擁抱吧
Hi everyone. I'm Olaf. And I like warm hugs.

677
00:46:38,390 --> 00:46:39,560
奧洛夫
Olaf?

678
00:46:42,390 --> 00:46:44,770
是的  奧洛夫 
That's right, Olaf.

679
00:46:45,520 --> 00:46:48,520
小姐芳名啊
And you are?

680
00:46:49,060 --> 00:46:50,440
我叫安娜
Oh, um... I'm Anna.

681
00:46:50,440 --> 00:46:52,780
這頭滑稽的蠢驢是誰
And who's the funky-looking donkey over there?

682
00:46:52,780 --> 00:46:54,440
它叫斯溫
That's Sven.

683
00:46:54,440 --> 00:46:56,110
那這只馴鹿呢
Uh-huh. And who's the reindeer?

684
00:46:56,320 --> 00:46:57,570
斯溫
Sven.

685
00:46:57,570 --> 00:47:00,240
同名啊  真好記
They're...oh, okay...Makes things easier for me.

686
00:47:01,530 --> 00:47:02,990
瞧瞧它  想親我的鼻子
Ha. Aw, look at him tryin' to kiss my nose.

687
00:47:02,990 --> 00:47:04,490
我也喜歡你
I like you, too!

688
00:47:04,490 --> 00:47:06,740
奧洛夫  你是艾爾莎造出來的嗎
Olaf, did Elsa build you?

689
00:47:06,740 --> 00:47:07,950
是的  怎麼了
Yeah. Why?

690
00:47:07,950 --> 00:47:09,950
-你知道她在哪嗎  -知道  怎麼了
- You know where she is? - Yeah. Why?

691
00:47:10,040 --> 00:47:11,580
你能給我們引路嗎
Do you think you could show us the way?

692
00:47:11,670 --> 00:47:13,750
-可以  怎麼了  -這是怎麼弄的
- Yeah. Why? - How does this work?

693
00:47:14,250 --> 00:47:16,420
別鬧了  斯溫  談正事呢
Stop it, Sven. Trying to focus here.

694
00:47:16,590 --> 00:47:19,000
-是的  怎麼了  -我告訴怎麼了
- Yeah, Why? - I'll tell you Why.

695
00:47:19,050 --> 00:47:21,010
我們需要艾爾莎喚回夏天
We need Elsa to bring back Summer.

696
00:47:21,090 --> 00:47:22,630
夏天啊
Summer?

697
00:47:22,800 --> 00:47:24,470
我也不知道為什麼
Oh, I don't know why but.

698
00:47:24,470 --> 00:47:27,590
但是我一直都很嚮往夏天
I've always loved the idea of summer,

699
00:47:27,840 --> 00:47:31,350
還有太陽和所有一切炙熱的東西
and sun, and all things hot.

700
00:47:31,350 --> 00:47:32,520
真的嗎
Really?

701
00:47:32,520 --> 00:47:34,640
我猜你是沒怎麼接觸過高溫吧
I'm guessing you don't have much experience with heat.

702
00:47:35,020 --> 00:47:36,390
沒有
Nope!

703
00:47:36,390 --> 00:47:39,270
但是有時候我喜歡閉上眼睛
But sometimes I like to close my eyes

704
00:47:39,270 --> 00:47:42,770
想像夏天真實來臨時的景象
and imagine what it'd be like when summer does come.

705
00:47:45,900 --> 00:47:50,160
蜜蜂在蜂鳴  孩童吹起蒲公英的絨毛
Bees'll buzz, kids'll blow dandelion fuzz

706
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:54,990
而我就像個雪人一樣享受夏天
And I'll be doing whatever snow does in summer

707
00:47:56,780 --> 00:48:01,330
手裡抓著杯飲料  躺在灼人的沙灘上
A drink in my hand, my snow up against the burning sand

708
00:48:01,410 --> 00:48:05,460
也許還能曬個美麗的小麥色
Prob'ly getting gorgeously tanned in summer

709
00:48:05,960 --> 00:48:07,880
我終於可以見證夏日的微風
I'll finally see a summer breeze

710
00:48:07,880 --> 00:48:09,790
吹走冬日的暴風
Blow away a winter storm

711
00:48:10,420 --> 00:48:11,840
我還要看看天氣變暖後
And find out what happens to

712
00:48:11,840 --> 00:48:15,300
冰凍成塊的水會如何變化
Solid water, when it gets warm

713
00:48:16,970 --> 00:48:21,140
我等不及想知道  我的小夥伴們都會怎麼看我
And I can't wait to see, what my buddies all think of me

714
00:48:21,470 --> 00:48:26,100
想像一下我要是在夏天得有多酷呀
Just imagine how much cooler I'll be in summer

715
00:48:31,020 --> 00:48:32,940
寒冷和炎熱都是如此的猛烈
The hot and the cold are both so intense

716
00:48:32,940 --> 00:48:35,520
兩者結合  將會多麼轟烈
Put 'em together, it just makes sense

717
00:48:39,650 --> 00:48:41,690
冬天適合待在室內相互依偎
Winter's a good time to stay in and cuddle

718
00:48:41,690 --> 00:48:43,700
但是到了夏天  我將會成為一個
But put me in summer and I'll be a

719
00:48:45,030 --> 00:48:46,780
幸福的雪人
Happy snowman

720
00:48:46,780 --> 00:48:50,410
在生活艱辛之時  我喜歡堅持我的夢想
When life gets rough I like to hold on to my dream

721
00:48:50,740 --> 00:48:55,460
想像自己在夏日裡慵懶地散發熱氣
Of relaxing in the summer sun just letting off steam

722
00:48:57,210 --> 00:49:00,790
天空將會如此湛藍
Oh the sky will be blue

723
00:49:00,790 --> 00:49:04,420
你們倆也會陪伴在我身邊
And you guys'll be there too

724
00:49:04,420 --> 00:49:09,840
而我終將成為一個活在夏天的雪人
When I finally do what frozen things do in summer

725
00:49:10,090 --> 00:49:12,180
-我要告訴他實情  -你敢
- I'm gonna tell him. - Don't you dare.

726
00:49:13,140 --> 00:49:13,850
在炎夏
In summer

727
00:49:20,390 --> 00:49:23,190
走吧  要找艾爾莎請跟我來
So, Come on! Elsa's this way.

728
00:49:23,190 --> 00:49:25,940
咱們去把夏天捎回來吧
Let's go bring back summer!

729
00:49:25,940 --> 00:49:27,520
我來了
I'm coming!

730
00:49:28,860 --> 00:49:30,570
總得有人告訴他實情啊
Somebody's got to tell him.

731
00:49:35,780 --> 00:49:38,160
不  不  你把有樹皮的那面朝下了
No. No. You've got the bark facing down.

732
00:49:38,160 --> 00:49:39,950
樹皮那面要朝上放
The bark needs to be face-up.

733
00:49:40,280 --> 00:49:41,830
樹皮朝下放更乾燥
Bark down is drier.

734
00:49:41,830 --> 00:49:43,280
-樹皮朝上  -樹皮朝下
- Bark up... - Bark down.

735
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:45,330
斗篷  有人要斗篷嗎
Cloak. Does anyone need a cloak?

736
00:49:45,330 --> 00:49:48,410
阿倫黛爾的人民感謝您  殿下
Arendelle is indebted to you, Your Highness.

737
00:49:48,410 --> 00:49:50,710
城堡現在開放了  大廳裡有
The castle is open. There's soup

738
00:49:50,710 --> 00:49:53,000
熱湯和格拉格熱飲<font size="14">[瑞典]</font>
and hot glogg in the Great Hall.

739
00:49:53,000 --> 00:49:54,290
給  把這些發下去
Here. Pass these out.

740
00:49:54,290 --> 00:49:56,000
漢斯王子  我們是不是
Prince Hans, are we just

741
00:49:56,000 --> 00:49:57,760
就得這麼坐在一旁
expected to sit here and freeze

742
00:49:57,760 --> 00:50:01,130
瑟瑟發抖地看著你把阿倫黛爾的貨物免費發放完啊
while you give away all of Arendelle's tradable goods?

743
00:50:01,130 --> 00:50:02,720
安娜公主已經下令
Princess Anna has given her orders and...

744
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:04,340
那是另一回事
And that's another thing,

745
00:50:04,340 --> 00:50:06,260
你有沒有想過  你的公主
has it dawned on you that your Princess

746
00:50:06,260 --> 00:50:08,180
可能正和邪惡的女巫密謀
may be conspiring with a wicked sorceress...

747
00:50:08,180 --> 00:50:09,390
把全國人民都毀掉呢
to destroy us all?

748
00:50:09,390 --> 00:50:12,890
不許質疑公主  她既然讓我掌權
Do not question the Princess. She left me in charge,

749
00:50:12,890 --> 00:50:14,390
那我將毫不遲疑地
and I will not hesitate to

750
00:50:14,390 --> 00:50:15,850
保護阿倫黛爾不受叛亂之苦
protect Arendelle from treason.

751
00:50:16,480 --> 00:50:18,140
叛亂
Treason?!

752
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:26,070
夥計  冷靜  冷靜
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa, boy. Easy. Easy.

753
00:50:28,320 --> 00:50:31,490
這是安娜公主的馬  她出什麼事了  她人呢
Princess Anna's horse. What happened to her? Where is she?

754
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:34,530
安娜公主身陷險境
Princess Anna is in trouble.

755
00:50:34,530 --> 00:50:37,370
我需要志願者跟我一起找她
I need volunteers to go with me to find her!

756
00:50:37,410 --> 00:50:40,790
我的侍從跟隨您  殿下
I volunteer two men, my Lord!

757
00:50:40,910 --> 00:50:42,790
做好萬全準備
Be prepared for anything,

758
00:50:42,790 --> 00:50:45,120
萬一你們遇見皇后
and should you encounter the Queen,

759
00:50:45,540 --> 00:50:48,670
你們有權結束這個冬天
you are to put an end to this winter.

760
00:50:48,670 --> 00:50:50,630
明白嗎
Do you understand?

761
00:50:54,420 --> 00:50:57,550
你到底準備怎麼結束這個鬼天氣呢
So how exactly are you planning to stop this weather?

762
00:50:57,800 --> 00:51:00,430
我準備跟我姐姐談談
Oh, I am gonna talk to my sister.

763
00:51:00,430 --> 00:51:02,470
這就是你的計畫嗎  我的冰塊生意
That's your plan? My ice business is

764
00:51:02,470 --> 00:51:04,560
就指著你跟你姐姐談談嗎
riding on you talking to your sister.

765
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:06,230
沒錯
Yup.

766
00:51:06,270 --> 00:51:08,270
這麼說你是一點都不怕她咯
So you're not at all afraid of her?

767
00:51:08,270 --> 00:51:10,100
-我為什麼要怕她呀  -就是說
- Why would I be? - Yeah.

768
00:51:10,100 --> 00:51:13,190
我敢打賭艾爾莎一定是有史以來
I bet Elsa's the nicest, gentlest,

769
00:51:13,190 --> 00:51:15,190
最善良最溫柔最溫暖的人了
warmest person ever.

770
00:51:15,230 --> 00:51:16,940
看啊
Oh, look at that.

771
00:51:16,940 --> 00:51:18,570
我被釘住了
I've been impaled.

772
00:51:23,400 --> 00:51:25,030
現在怎麼辦
What now?

773
00:51:27,910 --> 00:51:29,660
這懸崖太陡了  我只有一條繩子
It's too steep. I've only got one rope,

774
00:51:29,660 --> 00:51:31,410
而你又不會爬山
and you don't know how to climb mountains.

775
00:51:31,490 --> 00:51:33,250
誰說我不會
Says who?

776
00:51:34,540 --> 00:51:35,870
你在幹嗎
What are you doing?

777
00:51:35,870 --> 00:51:39,870
我要去見我姐姐
I'm going to see my sister.

778
00:51:40,000 --> 00:51:44,000
你這是自殺的節奏呀  是我就不會踩那裡
You're going to kill yourself. I wouldn't put my foot there.

779
00:51:44,000 --> 00:51:45,880
-你別讓我分心  -踩那也不行
- You're distracting me... - Or there.

780
00:51:45,880 --> 00:51:48,050
你怎麼知道艾爾莎會肯見你呢
How do you know Elsa even wants to see you?

781
00:51:48,050 --> 00:51:49,760
我要遮罩你
I'm just blocking you out 'cause

782
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:51,800
因為我得專心爬山
I gotta concentrate here.

783
00:51:52,590 --> 00:51:54,220
你要知道大多數躲到深山裡的人
You know, most people who disappear

784
00:51:54,220 --> 00:51:55,930
都是希望自己一個人待著的
into the mountains want to be alone.

785
00:51:55,930 --> 00:51:59,480
沒人想要自己一個人待著  也許只有你
Nobody wants to be alone. Except maybe you.

786
00:51:59,480 --> 00:52:03,020
我可不是獨自一人  我有朋友的  記得嗎
I'm not alone... I have friends, remember?

787
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:05,730
你是說那些愛情專家們
You mean the love experts?

788
00:52:05,730 --> 00:52:07,860
沒錯  愛情專家們
Yes, the love experts!

789
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:12,360
我差不多爬到山頂了吧
Please tell me I'm almost there.

790
00:52:13,320 --> 00:52:15,780
這裡的空氣是不是更稀薄了
Does the air seem a bit thin to you up here?

791
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:19,570
-堅持住  斯溫
- Hang on. - Hey, Sven?

792
00:52:19,570 --> 00:52:22,120
我不知道我這算不算是解決了一大難題  但是
Not sure if this is going to solve the problem, but I found

793
00:52:22,160 --> 00:52:24,580
我找到了一個臺階  正好通往你們的目的地
a staircase that leads exactly where you want it to go.

794
00:52:24,580 --> 00:52:27,750
謝天謝地  接住我
Ha ha. Thank goodness. Catch!

795
00:52:28,210 --> 00:52:31,620
謝謝了  我還怕你不接呢
Thanks! That was like a crazy trust exercise.

796
00:52:46,010 --> 00:52:49,560
這麼多的冰  我快感動哭了
Now that's ice. I might cry.

797
00:52:49,560 --> 00:52:52,970
哭吧  我不笑你
Go ahead. I won't judge.

798
00:53:00,150 --> 00:53:03,520
好吧  慢慢來夥計  來  我扶著你
All right, take it easy boy. Come here, I gotcha.

799
00:53:03,940 --> 00:53:06,480
好吧  你就在這等著  兄弟
Okay. You stay right here, buddy.

800
00:53:08,150 --> 00:53:09,700
完美無瑕
Flawless.

801
00:53:14,660 --> 00:53:17,450
敲門  敲門呀
Knock... just knock...

802
00:53:19,160 --> 00:53:20,910
她怎麼還不敲門
Why isn't she knocking?

803
00:53:21,660 --> 00:53:24,120
你說她是不是不會敲門啊
Do you think she knows how to knock?

804
00:53:28,670 --> 00:53:31,710
門開了  這可是史無前例
It opened. That's a first.

805
00:53:32,920 --> 00:53:34,720
你最好還是在外面等一下吧
You should probably wait out here.

806
00:53:34,720 --> 00:53:35,260
什麼
What?

807
00:53:35,260 --> 00:53:37,220
我上次向她引薦男人  她把一切都凍住了
Last time I introduced her to a guy, she froze everything.

808
00:53:37,220 --> 00:53:41,800
可是  可是  拜託  這可是冰城啊
But. But... oh come on, It's a palace made of ice.

809
00:53:41,850 --> 00:53:44,100
-冰就是我的生命啊  -拜拜  斯溫
- Ice is my life. - Bye, Sven.

810
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:46,060
你也在外面等  奧洛夫
You too, Olaf.

811
00:53:46,060 --> 00:53:48,350
-我也要嗎  -讓我們倆單獨談談
- Me? - Just give us a minute.

812
00:53:48,350 --> 00:53:49,730
好吧
Okay.

813
00:53:50,730 --> 00:53:55,110
一  二  三  四
One... two... three... four...

814
00:54:06,490 --> 00:54:10,870
艾爾莎  是我  安娜
Elsa? It's me... Anna.

815
00:54:14,580 --> 00:54:15,910
安娜
Anna?

816
00:54:19,750 --> 00:54:23,340
艾爾莎  你的樣子變了
Wow... Elsa, you look different...

817
00:54:23,590 --> 00:54:27,090
變漂亮了  還有這個宮殿
It's a good different... and this place.

818
00:54:27,090 --> 00:54:29,510
-真是美極了  -謝謝
- Is amazing. - Thank you.

819
00:54:30,050 --> 00:54:32,300
我以前一直不知道自己的能力
I never knew what I was capable of.

820
00:54:32,930 --> 00:54:35,640
對於之前發生的一切我很抱歉  要是我早知道...
I'm so sorry about what happened. If I'd known...

821
00:54:35,640 --> 00:54:37,100
不  沒事的
No, it's okay.

822
00:54:37,720 --> 00:54:39,850
你不需要道歉
You don't have to apologize.

823
00:54:39,850 --> 00:54:42,600
但是也許你該走了  拜託
But you should probably go, please.

824
00:54:43,060 --> 00:54:44,980
但是我才剛到呀
But I just got here.

825
00:54:44,980 --> 00:54:46,860
阿倫黛爾才是你的歸屬
You belong in Arendelle.

826
00:54:46,900 --> 00:54:50,190
-也是你的歸屬  -不  安娜  這裡才是
- So do you. - No, Anna. I belong here.

827
00:54:51,150 --> 00:54:52,490
我一個人的
Alone.

828
00:54:52,740 --> 00:54:54,900
我在這裡才能做真正的自己
Where I can be who I am,

829
00:54:55,360 --> 00:54:57,030
不會傷害到任何人
without hurting anybody.

830
00:54:57,110 --> 00:54:59,660
-實際上  關於這個問題  -58  59  60
- Actually, about that... - 58... 59... 60.

831
00:55:00,200 --> 00:55:02,080
等一下  那是什麼聲音
Wait. What is that?

832
00:55:02,080 --> 00:55:04,950
我叫奧洛夫  我喜歡熱情的擁抱
Hi, I'm Olaf and I like warm hugs.

833
00:55:05,240 --> 00:55:06,950
奧洛夫
Olaf?

834
00:55:07,240 --> 00:55:10,080
你堆出來的雪人  你還記得嗎
You built me. You remember that?

835
00:55:10,580 --> 00:55:12,210
你居然活了
And you're alive?

836
00:55:12,540 --> 00:55:14,670
我猜是吧
Um... I think so?

837
00:55:16,300 --> 00:55:18,670
跟小時候堆的那個一模一樣
He's just like the one we built as kids.

838
00:55:21,470 --> 00:55:23,590
咱們那時候多親啊
So we were so close.

839
00:55:23,840 --> 00:55:25,840
我們可以再回到那個時候
We can be like that again.

840
00:55:27,220 --> 00:55:29,600
慢點
Slow down.

841
00:55:32,060 --> 00:55:33,810
安娜
Anna!

842
00:55:36,440 --> 00:55:38,480
不  我們回不去了
No, We can't.

00:55:38,730 --> 00:55:40,400
-再見  安娜  -艾爾莎  等等
- Goodbye, Anna. - Elsa, wait.

844
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:42,900
別過來  我是在保護你
No, I'm just trying to protect you.

845
00:55:42,900 --> 00:55:45,570
你用不著保護我  我不害怕
You don't have to protect me. I'm not afraid.

846
00:55:46,360 --> 00:55:48,570
求你別再把我拒之門外了
Please don't shut me out again.

847
00:55:48,570 --> 00:55:50,570
求求你別再關上心門
Please don't slam the door.

848
00:55:50,570 --> 00:55:54,490
你不需要再跟我保持距離
You don't have to keep your distance anymore

849
00:55:54,740 --> 00:55:57,620
因為這麼久以來
'Cause for the first time in forever

850
00:55:57,790 --> 00:55:59,960
我終於理解了你
I finally understand

851
00:55:59,960 --> 00:56:04,420
好久以來第一次  我們可以攜手解決問題
For the first time in forever, we can fix this hand in hand

852
00:56:04,420 --> 00:56:06,670
我們可以一同走下這座冰山
We can head down this mountain together

853
00:56:06,670 --> 00:56:09,710
你無需再生活在恐懼中
You don't have to live in fear

854
00:56:09,710 --> 00:56:13,590
好久以來我終於可以說
'Cause for the first time in forever

855
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:17,180
我會待在你身邊
I will be right here

856
00:56:17,180 --> 00:56:20,140
安娜  求你回家去吧
Anna, please go back home

857
00:56:20,140 --> 00:56:22,180
美好的生活等著你
Your life awaits.

858
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:26,350
去享受陽光  敞開大門
Go enjoy the sun and open up the gates

859
00:56:26,350 --> 00:56:29,930
-可是  -我知道  你是一片好意
- Yeah, but... - I know! You mean well

860
00:56:29,930 --> 00:56:32,400
但我心意已決
But leave me be.

861
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:36,480
是  我是獨自一人  但我可以享受自由
Yes, I'm alone. But I'm alone and free.

862
00:56:36,480 --> 00:56:41,530
和我保持距離  你便不會受到傷害
Just stay away and you'll be safe from me

863
00:56:42,530 --> 00:56:44,490
-實際上  這是不可能的  -什麼意思
- Actually, we're not - What do you mean you're not

864
00:56:44,490 --> 00:56:46,120
看來你還不知道
I get the feeling you don't know

865
00:56:46,120 --> 00:56:47,870
我不知道什麼
What do I not know

866
00:56:47,990 --> 00:56:53,120
阿倫黛爾被很厚很厚很厚的積雪覆蓋
Arendelle's in deep deep deep deep snow

867
00:56:54,290 --> 00:56:55,330
什麼
What?

868
00:56:55,330 --> 00:56:59,420
你把所有地方都變成了冬天
You kind of set off an eternal winter... everywhere.

869
00:56:59,420 --> 00:57:00,830
所有地方
Everywhere?

870
00:57:00,830 --> 00:57:02,000
沒事的  你解凍一下就好了
It's okay, you can just unfreeze it.

871
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:03,170
不行
No, I can't.

872
00:57:03,170 --> 00:57:05,960
-我不知道怎麼解凍  -你肯定會的
- I don't know how. - Sure you can.

873
00:57:05,960 --> 00:57:07,340
我知道你會
I know you can!

874
00:57:07,340 --> 00:57:11,470
因為好久以來
'Cause for the first time in forever

875
00:57:11,470 --> 00:57:14,010
我真是個傻瓜  我無法擁有自由
I'm such a fool! I can't be free

876
00:57:14,220 --> 00:57:16,560
你無需再恐懼
You don't have to be afraid

877
00:57:16,560 --> 00:57:19,060
永遠無法逃離我內心的暴風雪
No escape from the storm inside of me

878
00:57:19,060 --> 00:57:21,230
我們可以一同解決
We can work this out together

879
00:57:21,230 --> 00:57:23,100
我無法掌控我身上的詛咒
I can't control the curse

880
00:57:23,100 --> 00:57:26,820
我們能逆轉嚴冬
We'll reverse the storm you've made

881
00:57:26,940 --> 00:57:29,520
安娜  拜託  你只會越弄越糟
Anna, please, You'll only make it worse

882
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:30,440
別驚慌
Don't panic

883
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:31,730
我內心充滿了恐懼
There's so much fear

884
00:57:31,730 --> 00:57:33,440
我們會讓陽光再度普照
We'll make the sun shine bright

885
00:57:33,530 --> 00:57:34,530
你在這不安全
You're not safe here

886
00:57:34,530 --> 00:57:36,450
我們可以共同面對
We can face this thing together

887
00:57:42,620 --> 00:57:46,040
我做不到
I can't

888
00:57:53,340 --> 00:57:56,000
安娜  你沒事吧
Anna. Are you okay?

889
00:57:56,460 --> 00:58:00,170
-我沒事  我挺好的  -這是誰
- I'm okay. I'm fine. - Who's this?

890
00:58:00,170 --> 00:58:03,260
等一下  這都不重要了  你們走吧
Wait, it doesn't matter. Just... you have to go.

891
00:58:03,260 --> 00:58:06,260
不  我知道我們能找到辦法
No, I know we can figure this out together.

892
00:58:06,260 --> 00:58:09,600
什麼辦法  你有什麼能力來結束這寒冬
How? What power do you have to stop this winter?

893
00:58:09,850 --> 00:58:10,970
來阻止我
To stop me?

894
00:58:10,970 --> 00:58:12,350
安娜  我們該走了
Anna, I think we should go.

895
00:58:12,350 --> 00:58:14,680
不  你不走我也不走  艾爾莎
No. I'm not leaving without you, Elsa.

896
00:58:14,770 --> 00:58:17,060
你必須走
Yes, you are.

897
00:58:25,150 --> 00:58:27,030
住手  放我們下來
Stop. Put us down!

898
00:58:27,190 --> 00:58:28,700
走開
Go away!

899
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:33,740
小心
Heads up!

900
00:58:34,370 --> 00:58:36,580
小心我的屁股
Watch out for my butt!

901
00:58:37,290 --> 00:58:40,200
把人拋來拋去的很不禮貌耶
It is not nice to throw people!

902
00:58:40,290 --> 00:58:42,040
小辣椒  別生氣了
Wow, wow, wow feisty pants. Ok, relax.

903
00:58:42,040 --> 00:58:43,790
冷靜點  冷靜點
Just calm down. Calm down.

904
00:58:43,790 --> 00:58:44,710
好吧  我沒事了
All Right. I'm Okay.

905
00:58:44,710 --> 00:58:45,920
別理那個雪人就是了
Just let the snow man be.

906
00:58:45,920 --> 00:58:47,420
-我很冷靜  -很好
- I'm calm. - Great.

907
00:58:47,710 --> 00:58:48,920
拜託
Come on!

908
00:58:53,760 --> 00:58:54,800
你看  這下好了  你把它惹急了
See. Now you made him mad!

909
00:58:54,800 --> 00:58:55,840
我去引開他
I'll distract him.

910
00:58:55,840 --> 00:58:57,840
你們倆趕緊跑
You guys go.

911
00:58:57,840 --> 00:59:00,140
不  不  我不是說你們
No, no, not you guys.

912
00:59:00,930 --> 00:59:02,680
這下麻煩了
This just got a whole lot harder.

913
00:59:20,860 --> 00:59:22,490
你在幹嘛
What are you doing?

914
00:59:25,950 --> 00:59:27,370
我打到他了
I got him!

915
00:59:29,030 --> 00:59:30,660
這得有三十多米吧
It's a hundred foot drop.

916
00:59:30,910 --> 00:59:32,290
是六十多米
It's two hundred.

917
00:59:34,250 --> 00:59:36,210
-你這是要幹嗎  -我在挖雪錨
- What's that for? - I'm digging a snow anchor.

918
00:59:36,210 --> 00:59:38,540
好吧  要是我們摔下去怎麼辦
Okay. What if we fall?

919
00:59:38,540 --> 00:59:40,460
下面的積雪有大概六米
There's twenty feet of fresh powder down there.

920
00:59:40,460 --> 00:59:42,380
摔下去也會感覺像是掉在了枕頭上
It'll be like landing on a pillow...

921
00:59:42,380 --> 00:59:44,050
至少我希望如此
hopefully.

922
00:59:46,510 --> 00:59:48,340
好了  安娜  數到三
Okay, Anna. On three.

923
00:59:48,340 --> 00:59:50,510
-一  -好吧  要跳的時候告訴我
- One... - Okay. You tell me when...

924
00:59:50,510 --> 00:59:52,640
-二  -我準備好了  我時刻準備著  沒錯
- Two... - I'm ready to go... I was born ready! Yes!

925
00:59:52,640 --> 00:59:54,100
冷靜點
Calm down.

926
00:59:56,430 --> 00:59:57,810
樹
Tree!

927
00:59:57,810 --> 01:00:02,890
搞什麼...  好吧  這事也常有
What the... Whoa! That happened.

928
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:06,860
天啊  我身材還真是超級走樣啊
Ah. Ah. Man, am I out of shape.

929
01:00:10,780 --> 01:00:13,610
好了  安娜  斯溫
There we go. Hey, Anna! Sven!

930
01:00:13,610 --> 01:00:16,700
你們倆跑哪去了  我們把那個大個子甩得遠遠的了
Where'd ya guys go? We totally lost marshmallow back there!

931
01:00:17,700 --> 01:00:20,120
我們正說到你呢
Hey. We were just talking about you.

932
01:00:20,450 --> 01:00:22,870
都是好話  都是好話
All good things, all good things.

933
01:00:22,870 --> 01:00:24,240
不
No!

934
01:00:27,080 --> 01:00:30,210
這樣也沒什麼分別  對吧
This is not making much of a difference! Is it?

935
01:00:31,670 --> 01:00:33,000
奧洛夫
Olaf!

936
01:00:33,460 --> 01:00:36,750
-堅持住  夥計們  -爬快點
- Hang in there, guys! - Go faster!

937
01:00:37,300 --> 01:00:39,130
等一下  搞什麼
Wait, what?

938
01:00:45,510 --> 01:00:46,850
克裡斯托夫
Kristoff!

939
01:00:48,680 --> 01:00:51,390
別再回來了
Don't come back!

940
01:00:51,390 --> 01:00:53,140
我們不會再來了
We won't.

941
01:01:00,440 --> 01:01:03,150
你說的沒錯耶  真的像掉在枕頭上一樣
Hey, you were right. Just like a pillow.

942
01:01:03,940 --> 01:01:05,150
奧洛夫
Olaf!

943
01:01:05,530 --> 01:01:08,610
我的腿沒有知覺了
I can't feel my legs!

944
01:01:09,820 --> 01:01:11,450
那是我的腿
Those are my legs.

945
01:01:11,450 --> 01:01:13,370
幫個忙  抓住我的屁股
Hey, do me a favor, grab my butt.

946
01:01:13,820 --> 01:01:15,580
感覺好多了
Oh, that feels better.

947
01:01:15,830 --> 01:01:18,200
斯溫  他找到咱們了
Hey, Sven! He found us.

948
01:01:18,200 --> 01:01:20,290
這只可愛的小馴鹿
Who's my cute little reindeer?

949
01:01:20,290 --> 01:01:22,330
不許這麼跟他講話
Don't talk to him like that.

950
01:01:25,170 --> 01:01:26,710
來
Here.

951
01:01:27,710 --> 01:01:29,710
-你沒事吧  -謝謝
- You okay? - Thank you.

952
01:01:31,380 --> 01:01:32,970
你的頭沒事吧
Um... how's your head?

953
01:01:34,260 --> 01:01:35,720
沒事  我挺好的
I mean, It's fine. Ah... I'm good.

954
01:01:35,720 --> 01:01:37,220
我腦殼比較厚
Ha. I've got a thick skull.

955
01:01:37,220 --> 01:01:40,970
我就沒有腦殼  也沒有骨頭
I don't have a skull... or bones.

956
01:01:41,220 --> 01:01:42,980
那麼
So...

957
01:01:43,060 --> 01:01:45,480
-現在怎麼辦  -現在怎麼辦
- So now what? - Now what?

958
01:01:45,980 --> 01:01:47,440
現在怎麼辦
Now what?!

959
01:01:47,600 --> 01:01:50,650
我該怎麼辦呢
Oooh! What am I gonna do?

960
01:01:50,650 --> 01:01:52,650
她把我趕出來了  我不能任由天氣這個樣子
She threw me out. I can't go back to

961
01:01:52,650 --> 01:01:54,650
就逃回阿倫黛爾
Arendelle with the weather like this.

962
01:01:54,650 --> 01:01:55,610
再說還有你的冰塊生意...
And then there's your ice business...

963
01:01:55,610 --> 01:01:58,150
別擔心我的冰塊生意
Hey, hey, don't worry about my ice business.

964
01:01:58,900 --> 01:02:00,860
-還是擔心一下你的頭髮吧  -什麼
- Worry about your hair. - What?

965
01:02:00,860 --> 01:02:02,820
我剛從懸崖上掉下來  你的頭髮也很亂好嗎
Just fell off a cliff. You should see your hair.

966
01:02:02,820 --> 01:02:04,990
不是  你的頭髮變白了  
No, yours is turning white.

967
01:02:04,990 --> 01:02:07,160
變白了  怎麼會  搞什麼
White? It's... what?

968
01:02:07,410 --> 01:02:09,870
是因為她打到你了  對吧
It's because she struck you, isn't it?

969
01:02:10,040 --> 01:02:11,870
看上去很糟嗎
Does it look bad?

970
01:02:12,790 --> 01:02:14,250
-沒有  -你猶豫了
- No. - You hesitated.

971
01:02:14,250 --> 01:02:17,670
不  我沒有  安娜  我們得找人幫忙  知道嗎  走吧
No, I didn't. Anna, you need help. Okay? Come on.

972
01:02:17,670 --> 01:02:21,050
-好吧  我們這是去哪  -去找我的朋友們
- Okay! Where are we going? - To see my friends.

973
01:02:21,050 --> 01:02:23,880
-那些愛情專家嗎  -愛情專家
- The love experts? - Love experts?!

974
01:02:23,880 --> 01:02:26,340
別擔心  他們會治好你的
And don't worry, they'll be able to fix this.

975
01:02:26,340 --> 01:02:28,300
你怎麼知道
How do you know?

976
01:02:28,840 --> 01:02:30,970
因為我曾經看過他們治好你
Because I've seen them do it before.

977
01:02:31,850 --> 01:02:34,810
我覺得我自己也是個愛情專家
I like to consider myself a love expert.

978
01:02:39,020 --> 01:02:42,390
別慌  控制住
Get it together. Control it.

979
01:02:42,810 --> 01:02:46,690
別去感受  別去感受
Don't feel. Don't feel.

980
01:02:46,690 --> 01:02:48,770
別去感受
Don't feel!

981
01:03:03,080 --> 01:03:05,870
看呀  斯溫  夜空還亮著
Look, Sven. The sky's awake.

982
01:03:08,670 --> 01:03:11,170
-你冷嗎  -有點
- Are you cold? - A little.

983
01:03:13,710 --> 01:03:15,670
等一下  過來
Wait. Come here.

984
01:03:19,510 --> 01:03:22,550
關於我的朋友們
So, about my friends...

985
01:03:23,090 --> 01:03:26,100
我說他們是朋友  其實他們更像是我的家人
Well, I say friends, they're more like family.

986
01:03:26,550 --> 01:03:29,010
總之  在我小的時候  只有我和斯溫相依為命
Anyway, when I was a kid, it was just me and Sven

987
01:03:29,010 --> 01:03:31,430
直到他們收留了我們
until you know, they took us in.

988
01:03:31,980 --> 01:03:33,850
-真的嗎  -是啊
- They did? - Yeah.

989
01:03:33,850 --> 01:03:35,640
我不想嚇唬你  但是他們
I don't want to scare you, they can be

990
01:03:35,640 --> 01:03:37,440
有時候不太會說話
a little bit inappropriate.

991
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:40,860
而且嗓門很大  非常大
And loud... very loud...

992
01:03:40,860 --> 01:03:43,230
他們有時還會很固執  還有點
They're also stubborn at times, and a little

993
01:03:43,230 --> 01:03:47,490
專橫  並且很沉  非常非常沉  所以你...
overbearing. And heavy. Really, really heavy. Which you...

994
01:03:47,490 --> 01:03:49,490
但是你別擔心  他們也還好  他們本意不壞
But you know, you're okay. They're fine. They mean well.

995
01:03:49,490 --> 01:03:51,910
克裡斯托夫  他們聽起來很棒
Kristoff, they sound wonderful.

996
01:03:53,530 --> 01:03:56,160
那好吧
Okay then.

997
01:03:56,160 --> 01:03:58,710
這就是我的家人
Meet my family.

998
01:03:58,710 --> 01:04:00,370
夥計們
Hey, guys!

999
01:04:00,370 --> 01:04:01,960
他們都是石頭
They're rocks.

1000
01:04:03,880 --> 01:04:07,670
他是個瘋子
He's crazy.

1001
01:04:10,170 --> 01:04:12,760
我差點認不出你來了  怎麼重了這麼多
Hey, Wow... I pretty recognize you, What's so much weigh?

1002
01:04:13,170 --> 01:04:16,090
我來引開他們的注意力  你趕緊逃
I'll distract them while you run.

1003
01:04:16,180 --> 01:04:20,850
斯溫的家人們  見到你們很高興
Hi, Sven's family! It's nice to meet you!

1004
01:04:20,970 --> 01:04:23,680
安娜  因為我很愛你  所以你趕緊逃
Anna, because I love you, I insist you run.

1005
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:27,480
我聽說你們是愛情專家
I understand you're love experts!

1006
01:04:27,980 --> 01:04:30,020
你怎麼還不逃
Why aren't you running?

1007
01:04:30,940 --> 01:04:33,440
好吧  我要去...
Okay. Um... I'm gonna go...

1008
01:04:33,440 --> 01:04:35,900
不  不  不  安娜  等一下
No, no, no. Anna, wait!

1009
01:04:37,730 --> 01:04:39,530
克裡斯托夫
Kristoff!

1010
01:04:44,200 --> 01:04:46,030
克裡斯托夫回來了
Kristoff's home!

1011
01:04:46,030 --> 01:04:48,120
克裡斯托夫  克裡斯托夫回來了  你走了好久啊
Kristoff! Kristoff's home! It's been too long!

1012
01:04:48,120 --> 01:04:50,200
克裡斯托夫回來了
Kristoff's home!

1013
01:04:50,200 --> 01:04:52,120
等一下  克裡斯托夫
Wait? Kristoff?

1014
01:04:52,120 --> 01:04:54,000
讓我好好看看你
Yeah... Oh, let me look at you!

1015
01:04:54,000 --> 01:04:55,750
把衣服脫下來  克裡斯托夫  我來給你洗洗
Oh, take off your clothes, Kristoff, I wash them.

1016
01:04:55,750 --> 01:04:57,380
不  我還是穿著衣服吧
Ah! No. I'm gonna keep my clothes on. Look.

1017
01:04:57,380 --> 01:04:59,040
見到你們很高興
it's great to see you all.

1018
01:04:59,040 --> 01:05:01,340
-但是老帕比呢  -他在午睡
- But where's Grand Pabbie? - He's napping.

1019
01:05:01,340 --> 01:05:03,090
可是你看  我長出蘑菇來了
But look, I grew a mushroom.

1020
01:05:03,090 --> 01:05:04,800
我贏得了一塊火晶
And I earned my fire crystal.

1021
01:05:04,800 --> 01:05:06,260
我取了一塊腎結石
I passed a kidney stone.

1022
01:05:06,300 --> 01:05:07,680
克裡斯托夫  抱我起來
Kristoff, pick me up.

1023
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:10,340
你長大了  不錯啊
You're getting big! Good for you.

1024
01:05:10,340 --> 01:05:12,850
地精  它們是地精啊
Trolls? They're trolls.

1025
01:05:15,390 --> 01:05:20,140
他還帶回來個姑娘
He's brought a girl!

1026
01:05:21,140 --> 01:05:22,140
她就像個小蛋糕
She's like a little cupcake.

1027
01:05:23,020 --> 01:05:24,150
什麼情況
What's going on?

1028
01:05:24,150 --> 01:05:25,480
我早就習慣它們了
I've learned to just roll with it.

1029
01:05:25,560 --> 01:05:26,070
我看看
Let me see.

1030
01:05:26,070 --> 01:05:29,110
眼睛明亮  鼻子好使  牙齒堅固
Bright eyes. Working nose. Strong teeth.

1031
01:05:29,110 --> 01:05:32,570
好好好  她跟我們家克裡斯托夫很般配
Yes, yes, yes. She'll do nicely for our Kristoff.

1032
01:05:32,570 --> 01:05:33,400
等等  不是的
Wait. Oh, no.

1033
01:05:33,400 --> 01:05:34,350
你們誤會了
You've got the wrong idea.

1034
01:05:34,350 --> 01:05:36,070
她不是我女朋友
That's not why I brought her here.

1035
01:05:36,070 --> 01:05:38,370
對  我們不是  我不是...
Right. We're not. I'm not...

1036
01:05:38,370 --> 01:05:40,330
問題出在哪兒啊  親愛的
What's the issue, dear?

1037
01:05:40,330 --> 01:05:43,490
你為何拒絕他呢
Why are you holding back from such a man?

1038
01:05:43,490 --> 01:05:44,580
因為他走路很笨拙
Is it the clumpy way he walks

1039
01:05:44,580 --> 01:05:45,700
什麼
What?

1040
01:05:45,700 --> 01:05:47,030
還是他講話太粗魯
Or the grumpy way he talks

1041
01:05:47,030 --> 01:05:47,870
不是
No.

1042
01:05:47,870 --> 01:05:49,580
還是他的腳丫太奇怪
Or the pear-shaped, square-shaped

1043
01:05:49,580 --> 01:05:50,410
四四又方方  大鴨梨一樣
weirdness of his feet

1044
01:05:50,410 --> 01:05:51,250
行了吧
Hey!

1045
01:05:52,210 --> 01:05:54,500
他雖然勤洗澡
And though we know he washes well

1046
01:05:54,540 --> 01:05:56,880
可還是有味道
he always ends up sorta smelly

1047
01:05:56,880 --> 01:06:00,880
但他細心又可愛  世間絕無雙
But you'll never meet a fella who's as sensitive and sweet

1048
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:01,630
很好啊  但是...
That's nice, but...

1049
01:06:01,630 --> 01:06:03,640
他也許不完美
So he's a bit of a fixer upper

1050
01:06:03,640 --> 01:06:05,720
也有些缺點
So he's got a few flaws

1051
01:06:05,720 --> 01:06:06,660
他思維很奇葩
His peculiar brain, dear

1052
01:06:06,660 --> 01:06:07,970
又為馴鹿癡狂
His thing for the reindeer

1053
01:06:07,970 --> 01:06:09,040
這有些不合常理
That outside a few of nature's laws

1054
01:06:09,040 --> 01:06:10,390
我才不是這樣的
This is not about me!

1055
01:06:10,390 --> 01:06:12,560
他還需要改良
So he's a bit of a fixer upper

1056
01:06:12,560 --> 01:06:14,810
但是我們堅信
But this we're certain of

1057
01:06:14,810 --> 01:06:16,440
你只要給他一點愛
You can fix this fixer upper up

1058
01:06:16,440 --> 01:06:19,150
就會讓他發光
with a little bit of love

1059
01:06:19,480 --> 01:06:21,650
我們能不能先別說這個了
Can we just stop talking about this?!

1060
01:06:21,650 --> 01:06:23,860
我們真遇上了麻煩
We've got a real, actual problem here.

1061
01:06:23,860 --> 01:06:26,060
親愛的告訴我
I'll say...so tell me dear.

1062
01:06:26,060 --> 01:06:28,570
是因為他容易膽怯
Is it the way that he runs scared

1063
01:06:28,570 --> 01:06:30,870
還是他不善社交
Or that he's socially impaired

1064
01:06:30,870 --> 01:06:34,030
還是他只愛伐木  在森林中央
Or that he only likes to tinkle in the woods

1065
01:06:34,030 --> 01:06:35,160
我不需要知道這個
I do not need to know that.

1066
01:06:35,160 --> 01:06:37,580
因為金髮太娘炮
Are you holding back your fondness

1067
01:06:37,580 --> 01:06:40,080
所以你不喜歡他
Due to his unmanly blondeness

1068
01:06:40,080 --> 01:06:42,080
還是他假裝不靠譜
Or the way he covers up

1069
01:06:42,080 --> 01:06:43,830
把自己隱藏
that he's the honest goods

1070
01:06:44,790 --> 01:06:46,460
他只是不完美
He's just a bit of a fixer upper

1071
01:06:46,460 --> 01:06:48,170
他有些小瑕疵
He's got a couple a' bugs

1072
01:06:48,170 --> 01:06:49,170
我才沒有
No, I don't.

1073
01:06:49,250 --> 01:06:51,340
別看他不善交往
His isolation is confirmation of

1074
01:06:51,340 --> 01:06:53,420
正說明他渴望擁抱
his desperation for healing hugs

1075
01:06:53,840 --> 01:06:55,680
他有些不完美
So he's a bit of a fixer upper

1076
01:06:55,680 --> 01:06:58,140
但我們有辦法
But we know what to do

1077
01:06:58,430 --> 01:07:00,300
我們的辦法就是讓
The way to fix up this fixer upper

1078
01:07:00,300 --> 01:07:02,180
你來雕琢他
is to fix him up with you

1079
01:07:03,850 --> 01:07:05,730
停停停  你們夠了
Stop it. Stop it. Stop it. Enough!

1080
01:07:05,730 --> 01:07:08,600
她都和別人訂婚了好嗎
She's engaged to someone else. Okay?!

1081
01:07:11,940 --> 01:07:14,520
所以問題出在她
So she's a bit of a fixer upper

1082
01:07:14,520 --> 01:07:16,230
這更不重要
That's a minor thing

1083
01:07:16,230 --> 01:07:18,690
口頭訂婚能取消
This quote engagement is a flex arrangement

1084
01:07:18,690 --> 01:07:21,400
也沒戒指在她手上
And by the way, I don't see no ring

1085
01:07:21,400 --> 01:07:23,410
所以問題出在她
So she's a bit of a fixer upper

1086
01:07:23,410 --> 01:07:25,410
她在猶豫彷徨
Her brain's a bit betwixt

1087
01:07:25,410 --> 01:07:27,660
別讓未婚夫擋道
Get the fiance out of the way

1088
01:07:27,660 --> 01:07:29,870
一切就會如常
and the whole thing will be fixed

1089
01:07:32,000 --> 01:07:33,960
我們不是說讓你改變他
We aren't saying you can change him

1090
01:07:33,960 --> 01:07:36,040
因為改變一個人很難
'Cause people don't really change

1091
01:07:36,830 --> 01:07:39,040
我們只是想說  愛是一種力量
We're only saying that love's a force

1092
01:07:39,040 --> 01:07:41,300
強大而奇妙
That's powerful and strange

1093
01:07:41,590 --> 01:07:44,010
因為瘋狂擔心  焦慮恐慌
People make bad choices

1094
01:07:44,010 --> 01:07:46,430
人們才會失誤
if they're mad or scared or stressed

1095
01:07:46,430 --> 01:07:48,840
但是給他們一點愛
But throw a little love their way

1096
01:07:48,840 --> 01:07:51,300
給他們一點愛
throw a little love their way

1097
01:07:51,300 --> 01:07:53,550
你就能讓他們做到最好
And you'll bring out their best

1098
01:07:53,550 --> 01:07:55,810
真愛讓人做到最好
True love brings out the best

1099
01:07:55,810 --> 01:07:58,310
每個人都不完美
Everyone's a bit of a fixer upper

1100
01:07:58,310 --> 01:08:00,190
人生就是這樣
That's what it's all about

1101
01:08:00,690 --> 01:08:02,000
父親母親  姐妹兄弟
Father, sister, brother

1102
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:03,310
我們都相互需要
We need each other

1103
01:08:03,310 --> 01:08:05,900
幫我們變好  讓我們成長
to raise us up and round us out

1104
01:08:06,020 --> 01:08:08,730
每個人都不完美
Everyone's a bit of a fixer upper

1105
01:08:08,730 --> 01:08:11,440
但到緊要關頭
But when push comes to shove

1106
01:08:11,610 --> 01:08:13,900
能讓你我變完美的
The only fixer upper fixer that can fix a fixer upper is

1107
01:08:13,900 --> 01:08:19,240
就是真真真真愛
True, True, True, True, Love

1108
01:08:19,240 --> 01:08:21,700
真愛至上
Love, Love, Love, True Love

1109
01:08:21,700 --> 01:08:24,160
至上
True-e-e-e-e-e

1110
01:08:24,160 --> 01:08:24,770
安娜
Do you, Anna,

1111
01:08:24,770 --> 01:08:28,120
你願意讓克裡斯托夫做你腫誠的...
take Kristoff to be your trollfully wedded...

1112
01:08:28,120 --> 01:08:29,290
等等  什麼
Wait, what?!

1113
01:08:29,290 --> 01:08:31,040
你要結婚啦
You're getting married.

1114
01:08:32,040 --> 01:08:33,040
安娜
Anna!

1115
01:08:33,460 --> 01:08:35,170
她冷得像冰一樣
She's as cold as ice.

1116
01:08:37,510 --> 01:08:39,840
她被施了奇怪的魔法
There's strange magic here!

1117
01:08:39,840 --> 01:08:41,640
老帕比
Grand Pabbie!

1118
01:08:41,640 --> 01:08:42,090
來來  讓我看看
Come, come. Bring her to me.

1119
01:08:43,970 --> 01:08:47,350
安娜  你有生命危險
Anna, your life is in danger.

1120
01:08:47,350 --> 01:08:50,970
你的心被你姐姐冰凍了
There is ice in your heart, put there by your sister.

1121
01:08:50,970 --> 01:08:52,270
如果不解除魔咒
If not removed,

1122
01:08:52,270 --> 01:08:55,810
冰會一點點加厚  最後把你永遠冰封
to solid ice will you freeze, forever.

1123
01:08:56,020 --> 01:08:57,480
什麼  不會吧
What? No.

1124
01:08:57,610 --> 01:08:59,270
你能除掉寒冰的  對吧
But you can remove it, right?

1125
01:08:59,270 --> 01:09:00,980
抱歉  克裡斯托夫  我不能
I can not, I'm sorry Kristoff.

1126
01:09:00,980 --> 01:09:05,280
如果是頭部還好
If it was her head that would be easy,

1127
01:09:05,280 --> 01:09:06,510
但如果心被冰凍
but only an act of true love

1128
01:09:06,510 --> 01:09:09,490
只有真愛才能融化
can thaw a frozen heart.

1129
01:09:10,200 --> 01:09:11,870
真愛
An act of true love?

1130
01:09:11,870 --> 01:09:14,660
也許是真愛之吻
A true love's kiss, perhaps?

1131
01:09:20,580 --> 01:09:23,080
安娜  我們得帶你回漢斯那兒
Anna, we've got to get you back to Hans.

1132
01:09:23,080 --> 01:09:24,210
漢斯
Hans.

1133
01:09:24,210 --> 01:09:25,840
我們走  斯溫
Pull us out, Sven.

1134
01:09:28,380 --> 01:09:31,760
-奧洛夫  快走  -我來了
- Olaf! Come on. - I'm coming!

1135
01:09:31,760 --> 01:09:35,970
我們去吻漢斯  漢斯是誰啊
Let's go kiss Hans! Who is this Hans?!

1136
01:09:45,680 --> 01:09:47,560
我們是來找安娜公主的
We are here to find Princess Anna.

1137
01:09:47,560 --> 01:09:49,520
大家要提高警惕
Be on guard,

1138
01:09:49,520 --> 01:09:52,190
但不能傷害女王
but no harm is to come to the Queen.

1139
01:09:53,020 --> 01:09:55,150
-明白了嗎  -明白  殿下
- Do you understand? - Yes, Sir.

1140
01:10:17,210 --> 01:10:19,000
女王
The Queen.

1141
01:10:24,000 --> 01:10:25,000
快  快
Go, go!

1142
01:10:25,000 --> 01:10:26,000
快點
Get on!

1143
01:10:33,680 --> 01:10:36,020
在上面  快
Up there! Come on!

1144
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:39,320
她跑不掉了
We got her.

1145
01:10:39,680 --> 01:10:41,640
別  求你們了
No, please.

1146
01:10:47,690 --> 01:10:49,480
別過來
Stay away!

1147
01:10:50,990 --> 01:10:52,690
射箭  射箭
Fire! Fire!

1148
01:10:52,780 --> 01:10:54,990
抓住她  抓住她
Get her! Get her!

1149
01:11:50,700 --> 01:11:52,450
艾爾莎女王
Queen Elsa!

1150
01:11:52,450 --> 01:11:55,160
別變成可怕的惡魔
Don't be the monster they fear you are.

1151
01:12:42,740 --> 01:12:45,490
不  我...我幹了什麼
No. What... what have I done?

1152
01:12:52,040 --> 01:12:53,750
你為什麼把我帶到這兒
Why did you bring me here?

1153
01:12:53,750 --> 01:12:55,790
我不能眼睜睜看著他們殺了你
I couldn't just let them kill you.

1154
01:12:55,790 --> 01:12:58,100
但我會危及阿倫黛爾
But I'm a danger to Arendelle.

1155
01:12:58,100 --> 01:12:59,420
去找安娜
Get Anna.

1156
01:12:59,420 --> 01:13:01,760
安娜還沒回來
Anna has not returned.

1157
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:05,550
請你結束冬天
If you would just stop the winter,

1158
01:13:05,550 --> 01:13:08,180
帶回夏天  拜託了
bring back summer. Please.

1159
01:13:09,010 --> 01:13:12,390
你還不明白嗎  我做不到
Don't you see? I can't.

1160
01:13:15,810 --> 01:13:18,850
你必須讓他們放了我
You have to tell them to let me go.

1161
01:13:20,060 --> 01:13:22,230
我儘量吧
I will do what I can.

1162
01:13:45,830 --> 01:13:48,670
堅持住  夥計  快點
Just hang in there. Come on, buddy, faster!

1163
01:13:56,260 --> 01:13:57,880
我們城堡見吧
I'll meet you guys at the castle!

1164
01:13:57,880 --> 01:13:59,550
別被人發現  奧洛夫
Stay out of sight, Olaf!

1165
01:13:59,550 --> 01:14:01,180
不會的
I will!

1166
01:14:13,190 --> 01:14:15,100
是安娜公主
It's Princess Anna!

1167
01:14:23,030 --> 01:14:25,490
你沒...沒事吧
Are you g... gonna be okay?

1168
01:14:27,030 --> 01:14:29,070
別擔心我
Don't worry about me.

1169
01:14:29,070 --> 01:14:31,490
安娜  我們擔心死你了
Anna! Oh, you had us worried sick...

1170
01:14:31,490 --> 01:14:32,240
殿下
My Lady.

1171
01:14:32,240 --> 01:14:35,620
給她取暖  快去找漢斯王子
Get her warm and find Prince Hans, immediately.

1172
01:14:35,620 --> 01:14:37,660
我們會的  謝謝你了
We will. Thank you.

1173
01:14:37,660 --> 01:14:39,620
一定要保證她安全
Make sure she's safe!

1174
01:14:57,760 --> 01:14:59,760
我要回去找安娜公主
I'm going back out to look for Princess Anna.

1175
01:14:59,810 --> 01:15:01,810
你不能再冒這個險了
You cannot risk going out there again.

1176
01:15:01,810 --> 01:15:02,930
如果她有個三長兩短...
If anything happens to her...

1177
01:15:02,930 --> 01:15:04,850
如果公主殿下遭遇不測
If anything happens to the Princess,

1178
01:15:04,850 --> 01:15:06,810
阿倫黛爾可就指望您了
you are all Arendelle has left.

1179
01:15:09,730 --> 01:15:11,860
他在這兒  漢斯王子
He's in here. Prince Hans.

1180
01:15:11,860 --> 01:15:14,360
安娜  你身上好冷
Anna. You're so cold.

1181
01:15:14,360 --> 01:15:15,650
-漢斯  你必須吻我  -什麼
- Hans, you have to kiss me. - What?

1182
01:15:15,650 --> 01:15:16,220
現在
Now.

1183
01:15:16,220 --> 01:15:17,360
-馬上  -冷靜點
- Now.  - Settle down.

1184
01:15:17,360 --> 01:15:19,570
我們讓你倆單獨待會兒
We'll give you two some privacy.

1185
01:15:19,900 --> 01:15:21,610
發生了什麼
What happened out there?

1186
01:15:21,610 --> 01:15:23,370
艾爾莎用魔法襲擊了我
Elsa struck me with her powers.

1187
01:15:23,370 --> 01:15:24,660
你說她不會傷害你的
You said she'd never hurt you.

1188
01:15:24,660 --> 01:15:25,950
我想錯了
I was wrong.

1189
01:15:26,410 --> 01:15:27,950
安娜
Anna?

1190
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:31,390
她冰凍了我的心
She froze my heart

1191
01:15:31,390 --> 01:15:34,370
只有真愛才能救我的命
and only an act of true love can save me.

1192
01:15:36,040 --> 01:15:37,830
真愛之吻
A true love's kiss.

1193
01:15:47,890 --> 01:15:49,760
安娜啊
Oh, Anna...

1194
01:15:50,590 --> 01:15:53,550
要是真有人愛你就好了
If only there was someone out there who loved you.

1195
01:15:53,810 --> 01:15:55,270
什麼
What?

1196
01:15:58,020 --> 01:16:00,520
你說你愛我的
You said you did.

1197
01:16:01,650 --> 01:16:03,990
作為我們王國的第十三名王子
As thirteenth in line in my own kingdom,

1198
01:16:03,990 --> 01:16:05,650
我是沒機會掌權的
I didn't stand a chance.

1199
01:16:05,650 --> 01:16:06,690
我知道...
I knew...

1200
01:16:06,690 --> 01:16:09,400
我必須去和其他王室聯姻
I'd have to marry into the throne somewhere.

1201
01:16:09,400 --> 01:16:11,400
你在說些什麼
What are you talking about?

1202
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:13,650
作為繼承人  當然艾爾莎更好
As heir, Elsa was preferable, of course.

1203
01:16:13,650 --> 01:16:15,990
但是沒人能接近她
But no one was getting anywhere with her.

1204
01:16:15,990 --> 01:16:17,410
-而你呢...  -漢斯
- But you... - Hans?

1205
01:16:17,410 --> 01:16:18,950
你那麼渴望愛
You were so desperate for love.

1206
01:16:18,950 --> 01:16:21,540
你很願意嫁給我  就這樣
You were willing to marry me, just like that.

1207
01:16:23,000 --> 01:16:24,980
我都想好了  娶了你之後呢
I figured, after we married,

1208
01:16:24,980 --> 01:16:26,960
我就讓艾爾莎出點小意外
I'd have to stage a little accident for Elsa.

1209
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:29,500
漢斯  別這樣
Hans. No, stop.

1210
01:16:29,500 --> 01:16:31,720
誰知道她把自己毀了
But then she doomed herself,

1211
01:16:31,720 --> 01:16:33,340
你還蠢到家了去找她
and you were dumb enough to go after her.

1212
01:16:33,340 --> 01:16:34,590
別這樣
Please.

1213
01:16:34,590 --> 01:16:37,830
現在只需要殺掉艾爾莎
All that's left now is to kill Elsa

1214
01:16:37,830 --> 01:16:39,340
讓夏天回來嘍
and bring back summer.

1215
01:16:39,340 --> 01:16:42,010
你根本比不上艾爾莎
You're no match for Elsa.

1216
01:16:42,010 --> 01:16:44,640
不  是你比不上艾爾莎
No, you're no match for Elsa.

1217
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:47,680
我呢  從另一方面說  現在可是英雄
I, on the other hand, am the hero

1218
01:16:47,680 --> 01:16:50,640
我將把阿倫黛爾從毀滅的危險中解救出來
who is going to save Arendelle from destruction.

1219
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:53,810
你不會得逞的
You won't get away with this.

1220
01:16:55,350 --> 01:16:57,520
可我已經得逞嘍
Oh, I already have.

1221
01:17:02,480 --> 01:17:05,280
來人啊  救命
Please, somebody help.

1222
01:17:08,200 --> 01:17:10,830
救救我  救救我
Please, please!

1223
01:17:13,160 --> 01:17:14,830
天越來越冷了
It's getting colder by the minute.

1224
01:17:14,830 --> 01:17:16,580
如果不趕緊採取措施
If we don't do something soon,

1225
01:17:16,580 --> 01:17:17,750
都會被凍死的
we'll all freeze to death.

1226
01:17:18,870 --> 01:17:22,920
-漢斯王子  -安娜公主已經...
- Prince Hans. - Princess Anna is...

1227
01:17:23,630 --> 01:17:25,040
-不在了  -什麼
- dead. - What...?

1228
01:17:25,420 --> 01:17:28,130
她怎麼了
What happened to her?

1229
01:17:31,840 --> 01:17:35,260
她被艾爾莎女王殺掉了
She was killed by Queen Elsa.

1230
01:17:36,600 --> 01:17:38,510
那可是她親姐姐啊
Her own sister.

1231
01:17:38,510 --> 01:17:41,390
幸好在她死在我懷中之前
At least we got to say our marriage vows

1232
01:17:43,140 --> 01:17:45,310
我們結婚了
before she died in my arms.

1233
01:17:47,100 --> 01:17:49,100
現在毋庸置疑了
There can be no doubt now.

1234
01:17:49,100 --> 01:17:51,140
艾爾莎女王是個怪物
Queen Elsa is a monster

1235
01:17:51,140 --> 01:17:52,780
我們都有危險
and we are all in grave danger.

1236
01:17:52,780 --> 01:17:56,860
漢斯殿下  阿倫黛爾就靠您了
Prince Hans, Arendelle looks to you.

1237
01:17:58,070 --> 01:17:59,300
我沉重宣佈
With a heavy heart,

1238
01:17:59,300 --> 01:18:04,490
阿倫黛爾的艾爾莎女王犯叛國罪
I charge Queen Elsa of Arendelle with treason

1239
01:18:04,870 --> 01:18:07,660
我判處她死刑
and sentence her to death.

1240
01:18:19,960 --> 01:18:20,960
快點
Hurry up!

1241
01:18:20,960 --> 01:18:24,720
她很危險  動作要快  不能疏忽
She's dangerous. Move quickly and be careful.

1242
01:18:24,720 --> 01:18:27,720
-門打不開  -凍住了
- The door's not open! - It's frozen.

1243
01:18:55,660 --> 01:18:58,740
幹嘛啊  夥計  我說  當心點
What is it, buddy? Hey, watch it.

1244
01:18:58,740 --> 01:19:00,330
你這是怎麼了
What's wrong with you?

1245
01:19:03,250 --> 01:19:05,830
你這麼說我聽不明白
I don't understand you when you talk like that.

1246
01:19:06,620 --> 01:19:09,250
停下  放我下來
Ah! Stop it! Put me down!

1247
01:19:10,590 --> 01:19:13,000
別這樣  斯溫  我們不會回去的
No, Sven! We're not going back!

1248
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,380
人家和她真愛在一起呢
She's with her true love.

1249
01:19:21,970 --> 01:19:23,350
這是什麼...
What the...

1250
01:19:25,850 --> 01:19:27,680
安娜
Anna!

1251
01:19:33,680 --> 01:19:34,680
快點  快點啊哥們
Come on! Come on, boy!

1252
01:19:52,950 --> 01:19:54,700
救命
Help.

1253
01:19:59,420 --> 01:20:02,040
安娜  不是吧
Anna. Oh no.

1254
01:20:14,840 --> 01:20:19,180
奧洛夫  奧洛夫  離那兒遠點
Olaf? Olaf. Get away from there.

1255
01:20:20,640 --> 01:20:23,680
這就是熱的感覺啊  我喜歡
So this is heat. I love it.

1256
01:20:23,680 --> 01:20:26,640
但我可不能碰
Ooh! But don't touch it!

1257
01:20:34,530 --> 01:20:38,240
漢斯哪去了  你的吻呢
So, where's Hans? What happened to your kiss?

1258
01:20:38,240 --> 01:20:41,870
我看走眼了  他不是真愛
I was wrong about him. It wasn't true love.

1259
01:20:42,200 --> 01:20:43,870
我們白跑了那麼遠的路回來
But we ran all the way here?

1260
01:20:43,870 --> 01:20:46,320
奧洛夫  你不能待在這兒
Please Olaf, you can't stay here,

1261
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:47,450
會融化的
you'll melt.

1262
01:20:47,450 --> 01:20:50,220
在找到真愛救你之前
I am not leaving here

1263
01:20:50,220 --> 01:20:51,410
我不會離開你的
until we find some other act of true love to save you.

1264
01:20:51,540 --> 01:20:53,710
你有什麼主意嗎
Do you happen to have any ideas?

1265
01:20:53,710 --> 01:20:56,710
我都不明白什麼是愛
I don't even know what love is.

1266
01:20:56,710 --> 01:20:58,590
那沒關係  我明白
That's okay, I do.

1267
01:20:58,590 --> 01:20:59,630
愛就是...
Love is...

1268
01:21:00,210 --> 01:21:02,420
把某個人看得比自己還重
putting someone else's needs before yours,

1269
01:21:02,420 --> 01:21:03,220
比如
like, you know,

1270
01:21:03,220 --> 01:21:06,010
克裡斯托夫把你送回漢斯身邊
how Kristoff brought you back here to Hans

1271
01:21:06,020 --> 01:21:07,260
然後永遠離開
and left you forever.

1272
01:21:10,260 --> 01:21:12,970
克裡斯托夫愛我嗎
Kristoff loves me?

1273
01:21:14,060 --> 01:21:18,180
你是真的不懂愛啊
Wow, you really don't know anything about love, do you?

1274
01:21:18,230 --> 01:21:19,270
奧洛夫  你要融化了
Olaf, you're melting.

1275
01:21:19,270 --> 01:21:22,270
為了某些人粉身碎骨都值得
Some people are worth melting for.

1276
01:21:27,650 --> 01:21:30,110
但現在好像不是時候
Just maybe not right this second.

1277
01:21:31,820 --> 01:21:34,030
別擔心  我去搞定
Don't worry, I've got it!

1278
01:21:35,950 --> 01:21:37,450
我們得想個辦法...
We're going to get through...

1279
01:21:37,450 --> 01:21:40,240
等等  我看見什麼了
Oh, wait. Hang on. I'm getting something.

1280
01:21:41,410 --> 01:21:44,110
是克裡斯托夫和斯溫
It's Kristoff and Sven!

1281
01:21:44,110 --> 01:21:45,460
他們回來了
They're coming back this way.

1282
01:21:45,830 --> 01:21:47,330
是他們
They... they are?

1283
01:21:47,330 --> 01:21:48,660
他跑得真快啊
Wow, he's really moving fast.

1284
01:21:48,660 --> 01:21:50,790
我可能想錯了
I guess I was wrong.

1285
01:21:50,790 --> 01:21:53,750
克裡斯托夫還沒愛你愛到完全放下你
I guess Kristoff doesn't love you enough to leave you behind.

1286
01:21:54,000 --> 01:21:56,050
扶我起來  奧洛夫  拜託
Help me up, Olaf. Please.

1287
01:21:56,050 --> 01:21:56,720
不不不
No, no, no, no, no.

1288
01:21:56,720 --> 01:21:59,180
你得待在爐火邊取暖
You need to stay by the fire and keep warm.

1289
01:21:59,180 --> 01:22:02,090
-我得去找克裡斯托夫  -幹嘛
- I need to get to Kristoff. - Why?

1290
01:22:02,470 --> 01:22:05,100
我知道為什麼了
Oh, oh, oh, I know why.

1291
01:22:05,100 --> 01:22:07,430
他是你的真愛啊
There's your act of true love right there,

1292
01:22:07,430 --> 01:22:09,890
就是那個勇士一般穿越峽灣
riding across the fjords like a valiant,

1293
01:22:09,890 --> 01:22:11,500
體味刺鼻的馴鹿國王
pungent reindeer King!

1294
01:22:11,500 --> 01:22:12,390
快走吧
Come on!

1295
01:22:15,150 --> 01:22:16,650
小心
Look out!

1296
01:22:25,610 --> 01:22:27,570
走這邊
Back this way!

1297
01:22:28,450 --> 01:22:29,950
我們被困住了
We're trapped.

1298
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:53,720
安娜  滑下去
Slide, Anna.

1299
01:23:02,350 --> 01:23:03,980
成功了
We made it!

1300
01:23:04,810 --> 01:23:06,850
走走走
Go, Go, Go, Go...

1301
01:23:18,950 --> 01:23:21,200
快點啊  夥計  快點
Come on, buddy, faster.

1302
01:23:22,950 --> 01:23:25,040
克裡斯托夫
Kristoff!

1303
01:23:30,040 --> 01:23:32,040
不要停
Keep going!

1304
01:23:34,000 --> 01:23:35,920
克裡斯托夫
Kristoff!

1305
01:24:02,920 --> 01:24:03,920
不要...
No...

1306
01:24:31,050 --> 01:24:33,170
斯溫
Sven!

1307
01:24:42,550 --> 01:24:44,390
好樣的
Good boy.

1308
01:24:55,400 --> 01:24:56,980
克裡斯托夫
Kristoff.

1309
01:25:00,440 --> 01:25:02,070
安娜
Anna!

1310
01:25:04,740 --> 01:25:06,280
艾爾莎
Elsa.

1311
01:25:06,450 --> 01:25:09,030
你不能一走了之
You can't run from this!

1312
01:25:10,580 --> 01:25:14,290
-照顧好我妹妹  -你妹妹
- Just take care of my sister. - Your sister?

1313
01:25:14,290 --> 01:25:16,870
她從山裡回來了  冰冷虛弱
She returned from the mountain weak and cold.

1314
01:25:16,910 --> 01:25:19,500
她說你冰凍了她的心
She said you froze her heart.

1315
01:25:20,330 --> 01:25:23,460
我努力救她  但還是來不及了
I tried to save her, but it was too late.

1316
01:25:23,960 --> 01:25:27,340
她的皮膚結了冰  頭髮也變白了
Her skin was ice. Her hair turned white.

1317
01:25:27,960 --> 01:25:31,760
你妹妹死了  都是你幹的
Your sister is dead... because of you.

1318
01:25:31,760 --> 01:25:32,760
不
No!

1319
01:25:55,690 --> 01:25:57,110
克裡斯托夫
Kristoff?

1320
01:25:59,030 --> 01:26:00,780
安娜
Anna!

1321
01:26:12,120 --> 01:26:13,710
艾爾莎
Elsa?

1322
01:26:21,420 --> 01:26:23,260
不
No!

1323
01:26:35,270 --> 01:26:36,980
安娜
Anna!

1324
01:26:38,100 --> 01:26:43,360
安娜  不要啊  求你了
Oh, Anna... no... no, please no.

1325
01:26:48,650 --> 01:26:50,190
安娜
Anna.

1326
01:26:52,160 --> 01:26:53,780
安娜
Anna?

1327
01:27:34,360 --> 01:27:36,320
安娜
Anna?

1328
01:27:38,400 --> 01:27:40,610
艾爾莎
Oh, Elsa.

1329
01:27:40,610 --> 01:27:42,820
你犧牲了自己來救我
You sacrificed yourself for me?

1330
01:27:44,110 --> 01:27:45,780
我愛你啊
I love you.

1331
01:27:46,870 --> 01:27:51,080
真愛能融化冰凍的心
An act of true love will thaw a frozen heart.

1332
01:27:52,040 --> 01:27:54,200
真愛會融化...
Love will thaw...

1333
01:27:54,990 --> 01:27:57,660
對啊  是愛
Love. Of course.

1334
01:27:57,660 --> 01:28:00,710
- 艾爾莎  -原來是愛啊
- Elsa? - Love.

1335
01:28:47,330 --> 01:28:49,120
我就知道你可以的
I knew you could do it.

1336
01:28:49,120 --> 01:28:52,960
毫無疑問  這是我今生最棒的一天
Hands down, this is the best day of my life

1337
01:28:52,960 --> 01:28:55,540
也很可能是最後一天
and quite possibly the last.

1338
01:28:55,540 --> 01:28:58,050
奧洛夫  挺住啊  小傢伙
Oh, Olaf. Hang on, little guy.

1339
01:29:01,170 --> 01:29:03,880
我自己的冰雪雲哎
Hey, my own personal flurry.

1340
01:29:14,020 --> 01:29:17,100
安娜   她不是冰凍了你的心嗎
Anna? But she froze your heart.

1341
01:29:17,100 --> 01:29:20,560
這裡你的心最冷
The only frozen heart around here is yours.

1342
01:29:24,560 --> 01:29:25,560
幹的漂亮
Fantastic!

1343
01:29:44,460 --> 01:29:47,130
我會把這個惡棍遣送回國的
I will return this scoundrel to his country.

1344
01:29:47,130 --> 01:29:48,250
我們可以看看
We shall see

1345
01:29:48,250 --> 01:29:51,040
他的十二個哥哥怎麼處理他
what his twelve big brothers think of his behavior.

1346
01:29:51,040 --> 01:29:52,710
阿倫黛爾感謝您  殿下
Arendelle thanks you, my Lord.

1347
01:29:52,710 --> 01:29:54,420
這不合理
This is unacceptable.

1348
01:29:54,420 --> 01:29:56,630
我是無辜的  我也受到了驚嚇
I am innocent. I'm a victim of fear.

1349
01:29:56,630 --> 01:29:59,550
我受到了創傷  我的脖子疼
I've been traumatized. Ow! My neck hurts.

1350
01:29:59,850 --> 01:30:02,760
我能否看下醫生  算了
Is there a doctor I could see? No.

1351
01:30:02,760 --> 01:30:05,510
我要見女王
I demand to see the Queen!

1352
01:30:05,510 --> 01:30:08,180
我這兒有女王的聖旨
I have a message from the Queen.

1353
